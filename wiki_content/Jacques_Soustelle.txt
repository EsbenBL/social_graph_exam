'''Jacques Soustelle''' (3 February 1912 – 6 August 1990) was an important and early figure of the [[Free French Forces]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] specializing in [[Pre-Columbian]] civilizations, and vice-director of the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in Paris in 1939. [[Governor General]] of [[Algeria]], he helped the rise of [[Charles de Gaulle]] to the presidency of the Fifth Republic, but broke with De Gaulle over Algerian independence, joined the OAS in their efforts to overthrow De Gaulle and lived in exile between 1961 and 1968. On returning to France he resumed political and academic activity and was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.academie-francaise.fr/immortels/base/academiciens/fiche.asp?param=667 |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612072011/http://www.academie-francaise.fr/immortels/base/academiciens/fiche.asp?param=667 |archive-date=12 June 2010}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Jacques Soustelle was born in [[Montpellier]], into a Protestant working-class family. A brilliant high school student, he was admitted to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] de la rue d'Ulm, which is still a major college within the French educational system (many [[Nobel Prize]] winners and [[Fields Medal]]ists are among its alumni). At the age of 20, he was admitted at the first place at the competitive exam of ''agrégation de philosophie'' (high-level grade for teaching). An [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]], he was general-secretary in 1935 of the French Union of Intellectuals against Fascism.

=== Anthropology of Mesoamerica ===
Soustelle developed an interest in [[Ethnology]] while working at the Musée de l'Homme under [[Paul Rivet]]. Rivet sent him to Mexico, after Soustelle became an [[Agrégation in France|Agrégé]], to study the [[Otomi people]]. Soustelle wrote his first major book ''Mexique, Terre Indienne'' (Mexico is Indian) about his time with the Otomi.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Writer and the World|chapter=Jacques Soustelle and the Decline of the West|author=V. S. Naipaul|author-link=V. S. Naipaul|pages=309–310}}</ref>

=== ''France Libre'' ===

After the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|Armistice of 22 June 1940]], he left [[Mexico]] to join the [[Free French Forces]] (FFL) in London. [[Charles de Gaulle]] charged him with a diplomatic mission in Latin America (1941), to set up support committees for Free France, to cut short the diplomatic efforts of Petainists throughout the continent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.franceculture.com/emission-epopee-de-la-france-libre-la-france-libre-dans-le-monde-2010-06-25.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626103851/http://www.franceculture.com/emission-epopee-de-la-france-libre-la-france-libre-dans-le-monde-2010-06-25.html |archive-date=26 June 2010}}</ref>
He headed the intelligence service ''[[Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action]]'' (BCRA).
He joined the ''Comité national français'', (Government of the [[Free France]], fighting [[Vichy France]], and the [[Axis powers]] ) in London, then ran the ''commissariat national à l’Information'' (1942).

Appointed to head the [[Special Services Branch]] (DGHS) in [[Algiers]] in (1943–1944) by the [[French Committee of National Liberation]]), He was Commissioner of the Republic (prefect) in [[Bordeaux]] then in the Liberation deputy of [[Mayenne]].

=== Reconstruction of France ===
In 1945, he served first as Minister of Information, then as Minister of the Colonies. From 1947 to 1951, he served as Secretary General of the [[Gaullist]] party ''[[Rassemblement du Peuple Français]]'' (RPF) and was one De Gaulle's closest counsellors.

=== Algeria ===
He was nominated Governor General of [[Algeria]] by [[Pierre Mendès France]] in 1955–56, [[Soustelle Plan|favouring]] the integration of the Muslim community in the [[Departments of France|French Departments]] along the [[Mediterranean]] coast. Thanks to Soustelle's support during the [[May 1958 crisis|May 1958 Algiers revolt]], De Gaulle returned to power.

Though he believed he would become Algeria Secretary, Soustelle was only named Information Minister in June 1958. In 1959, he was appointed Minister of State in charge of Overseas Departments by De Gaulle. He was unharmed after three ''[[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]]'' (FLN) terrorists attempted to assassinate him by shooting his car on the [[Place de l'Étoile]] in Paris. He asked De Gaulle for a presidential pardon for the only attacker who had been arrested and sentenced to death. Soustelle disagreed with De Gaulle's sudden turn for Algerian independence. He analyzed this turnaround in his book ''L'Espérance Trahie'' (Broken Hope). Soustelle was dismissed from the cabinet and the Gaullist party ''[[Union pour la nouvelle République]]'' ([[Union pour la nouvelle République|UNR]]) in 1960 and joined the terrorist ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' (OAS) in the fight against the independence of [[Algeria]]. When the OAS was replaced by the ''[[Conseil national de la Résistance (1962)|Conseil National de la Résistance]]'' (CNR), he joined this new organization with [[Georges Bidault]], former President of the World War II [[National Council of the Resistance]]. His activities led his being sued for attempting to undermine the authority of the French state. He lived in exile between 1961 and his 1968 amnesty.

===National Assembly===
Soustelle was elected to France's [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] (France's lower House) three times, first representing [[Mayenne]] in 1945–46, then the [[Rhône (département)|Rhône]] (1951–58) as a Gaullist, and from 1973 to 1978 as a member of the centrist [[Reforming Movement|Mouvement Réformateur]]. In 1974, he supported the bill legalizing [[abortion]] presented by [[Simone Veil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/interruption/1974-11-27-3.pdf|title=Assemblee Nationale|date=27 November 1974|website=Assemble-nationale.fr|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> 

He died, aged 78, in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].
