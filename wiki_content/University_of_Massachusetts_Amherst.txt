==History==
===Foundation and early years===
[[File:Mass Aggie.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Massachusetts Agricultural College as it appeared in 1879, with students and faculty standing in front of Old South College, North College, and the college's first chapel.]]
[[File:UMASeal100.svg|right|thumb|160px|The University's Centennial Seal]]
[[File:Old Chapel 6.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Old Chapel constructed in 1884 at the campus]]
The university was founded in 1863 under the provisions of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Federal Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] to provide instruction to Massachusetts citizens in "agricultural, mechanical, and military arts." Accordingly, the university was initially named the '''Massachusetts Agricultural College''', popularly referred to as "Mass Aggie" or "M.A.C."  In 1867, the college had yet to admit any students, been through two [[Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Amherst|Presidents]], and had still not completed any college buildings.  In that year, [[William S. Clark]] was appointed President of the college and Professor of Botany.  He quickly appointed a faculty, completed the construction plan, and, in the fall of 1867, admitted the first class of approximately 50 students.  Clark became the first president to serve longterm after the schools opening and is often regarded the primary founding father of the college.<ref>Frank Prentice Rand, ''Yesterdays at Massachusetts State College,'' (Amherst: The Associate Alumni of Massachusetts State College, 1933) pp. 17–19.</ref> Of the school's founding figures, there are a traditional "founding four"- Clark, [[Levi Stockbridge]], [[Charles Goessmann]], and [[Henry Goodell]], described as "the botanist, the
farmer, the chemist, [and] the man of letters."<ref>{{cite speech |title=Goodell–I Knew Him, [Dedication of the Goodell Library] |last=Hill |first=Joseph L. |date=November 7, 1935 |location=Amherst, Mass.}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Western New England|volume=1|pages=85–86|title=The College that the Bay State Built|date= March 1911|number=4|last=Neal|first=Robert Wilson|quote=To nearly all graduates up to 1900, or possibly 1905, the names of four such men especially (omitting even reference to trustees) were living names: Clark, Stockbridge, Goessmann and Goodell. These were the most prominent of the faculty leaders who, by making the old M.A.C. from year to year, made possible the new M.A.C. Each had his characteristic part... Clark, the dashing soldier, in the spectacular campaigns that accompanied the founding of the college; Stockbridge, of shrewd mother-wit and stubborn will, an embattled farmer is the cause of more popular education in carrying forward the institution at a time when it seemed to have lost all vitality and to live only from day to day as its saviors breathed upon it; Goessmann, scientist and German, in forming within the college the standards of exact scientific investigation. Last of the ‘Big Four’ was President Henry H. Goodell—classicist, modern thinker, lover of literature and the arts, disciplinarian, sympathizer, self-forgetter.}}</ref>

The original buildings consisted of Old South College (a dormitory located on the site of the present South College), North College (a second dormitory once located just south of today's Machmer Hall), the Chemistry Laboratory, also known as College Hall (once located on the present site of Machmer Hall), the Boarding House (a small dining hall located just north of the present Campus Parking Garage), the Botanic Museum (located on the north side of the intersection of Stockbridge Road and Chancellor's Hill Drive) and the Durfee Plant House (located on the site of the new Durfee Conservatory).<ref>Rand, p. 21.</ref>

Although enrollment was slow during the 1870s, the fledgling college built momentum under the leadership of President [[:wikiquote:Henry H. Goodell|Henry Hill Goodell]].  In the 1880s, Goodell implemented an expansion plan, adding the College Drill Hall in 1883 (the first gymnasium), the [[The Old Chapel (University of Massachusetts)|Old Chapel Library]] in 1885 (one of the oldest extant buildings on campus and an important symbol of the University), and the East and West Experiment Stations in 1886 and 1890.  The Campus Pond, now the central focus of the University Campus, was created in 1893 by damming a small brook. 
The early 20th century saw great expansion in terms of enrollment and the scope of the curriculum.  The first female student was admitted in 1875 on a part-time basis and the first full-time female student was admitted in 1892. In 1903, Draper Hall was constructed for the dual purpose of a dining hall and female housing.  The first female students graduated with the class of 1905.  The first dedicated female dormitory, the Abigail Adams House (on the site of today's Lederle Tower) was built in 1920.<ref>Rand, p. 147</ref>

By the start of the 20th century, the college was thriving and quickly expanded its curriculum to include the liberal arts.  The Education curriculum was established in 1907. In recognition of the higher enrollment and broader curriculum, the college was renamed '''Massachusetts State College''' in 1931.

Following World War II, the [[G.I. Bill]], facilitating financial aid for veterans, led to an explosion of applicants.  The college population soared and Presidents [[Hugh Potter Baker]] and [[Ralph Van Meter]] labored to push through major construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly with regard to dormitories (now Northeast and Central Residential Areas).  Accordingly, the name of the college was changed in 1947 to the '''University of Massachusetts'''.

===Modern era===
[[File:Umassentrysign.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Welcome sign at the university (west gate)]]
[[File:UMass Amherst Campus Center 2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|From the W. E. B. DuBois Library, a northward view.  The Lederle Graduate Research Tower can be seen in the background with the Campus Center and Hotel in the foreground.]]

By the 1970s, the University continued to grow and gave rise to a shuttle bus service on campus as well as many other architectural additions; this included the [[Murray D. Lincoln Campus Center]] complete with a hotel, office space, fine dining restaurant, campus store, and passageway to the parking garage, the [[W. E. B. Du Bois Library]], and the Fine Arts Center.

Over the course of the next two decades, the [[John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center]] and the Conte National Polymer Research Center were built and UMass Amherst emerged as a major research facility.  The Robsham Memorial Center for Visitors welcomed thousands of guests to campus after its dedication in 1989.  For athletic and other large events, the [[Mullins Center]] was opened in 1993, hosting capacity crowds as the Minutemen basketball team ranked at number one for many weeks in the mid-1990s, and reached the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] in 1996.

Since the University of Massachusetts Amherst was founded as the Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1863, 25 individuals have been at the helm of the institution.<ref>University of Massachusetts, Office of the Chancellor, ''Former Chancellors and Presidents of the Amherst Campus'' [http://www.umass.edu/chancellor/formerchancellors.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523233433/http://www.umass.edu/chancellor/formerchancellors.html|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref> Originally, the chief executive of UMass Amherst was a president. When UMass Boston was founded in 1963, it was initially reckoned as an off-site department of the Amherst campus, and was headed by a chancellor who reported to the president. A 1970 reorganization transferred day-to-day responsibility for UMass Amherst to a chancellor as well, with both chancellors reporting on an equal basis to the president. The title "President of the University of Massachusetts" now refers to the chief executive of the entire five-campus University of Massachusetts system.

There are approximately 1,300 full-time faculty at the university.<ref name=about/>  The university is organized into nine schools and colleges and offers 111 [[bachelor's degrees]], 75 [[master's degrees]], and 47 [[doctoral degrees]].<ref name=about/>

Students interested in studying outside of a particular major can apply to enroll in the bachelor's degree with Individual Concentration (BDIC) program. This is a unique program which allows students to design their own area of study. A BDIC concentration must be interdisciplinary, drawing from at least three fields or disciplines, and it may not duplicate an existing major. Courses can be selected from any department within the university as well as the campuses in the Five College Consortium. Course selection is guided by the students chosen faculty sponsor and a BDIC faculty supervisor. BDIC students are assigned to one of five academic clusters- Arts and Cultural studies; Business and Law; Communication; Education and Human Development; Natural Health, Computer Sciences and Engineering.

Additionally, the university offers two programs designed for adult and continuing education students, known as [[University Without Walls- UMass Amherst|University Without Walls]]<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/uww University Without Walls website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218085828/http://www.umass.edu/uww/ |date=February 18, 2016 }} Accessed: May 12, 2011.</ref> and Continuing and Professional Education.<ref>[Continuing and Professional Education site {{cite web |url=http://www.umass.edu/cpe/ |title=University Without Walls : UMass Amherst |access-date=August 1, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801183705/http://www.umass.edu/cpe/ |archive-date=August 1, 2017 }}] Accessed: May 12, 2011.</ref>

===Research===
{{Main|List of research centers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst}}

UMass research activities totaled more than $200 million in fiscal year 2014.<ref name=about/> In 2016 the faculty adopted an [[open-access policy]] to make its scholarship [[open access|publicly accessible]] online.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://roarmap.eprints.org/1187/ |title= University of Massachusetts Amherst |journal= ROARMAP: Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies |date= November 29, 2016 |publisher= [[University of Southampton]] |location= UK |access-date= July 24, 2018 |archive-date= July 14, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170714060326/http://roarmap.eprints.org/1187/ |url-status= live |last1= Jerome |first1= Erin }}</ref>

Researchers at the university made several high-profile achievements in recent years. In a bi-national collaboration, [[National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics]] and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst came together and built [[Large Millimeter Telescope]].<ref name="LMT 1">{{cite web|title=Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) - Overview|url=http://www.lmtgtm.org/?page_id=8|publisher=Large Millimeter Telescope|access-date=March 19, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301023239/http://www.lmtgtm.org/?page_id=8|archive-date=March 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name="LMT 2">{{cite web|title=Birth of a Telescope : Space exploration the UMass Way|url=http://www.umass.edu/gateway/feature/birth-telescope|publisher=University of Massachusetts Amherst|access-date=March 19, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318223120/http://www.umass.edu/gateway/feature/birth-telescope|archive-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> It was inaugurated in [[Mexico]] in 2006 (on top of [[Sierra Negra]]).

A team of scientists at UMass led by Vincent Rotello has developed a molecular nose that can detect and identify various proteins. The research appeared in the May 2007 issue of [[Nature Nanotechnology]], and the team is currently focusing on sensors, which will detect malformed proteins made by cancer cells.<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/newsreleases/articles/51484.php/ UMass Amherst Scientists Create Nano Nose With Aim of Sniffing Out Diseased Cells], UMass Amherst, April 23, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526121834/http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/newsreleases/articles/51484.php/ |date=May 26, 2007 }}</ref>
Also, UMass Amherst scientists Richard Farris, Todd Emrick and Bryan Coughlin led a research team that developed a synthetic polymer that does not burn. This polymer is a building block of plastic, and the new flame-retardant plastic will not need to have flame-retarding chemicals added to their composition. These chemicals have recently been found in many different areas from homes and offices to fish, and there are environmental and health concerns regarding the additives. The newly developed polymers would not require addition of the potentially hazardous chemicals.<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/newsreleases/articles/53157.php/ UMass Amherst Scientists Create Fire-Safe Plastic], UMass Amherst, May 30, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104000415/http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/newsreleases/articles/53157.php/ |date=November 4, 2007 }}</ref>

'''Environmental research'''
UMass Amherst researchers have positioned the campus as a national leader in [[sustainability]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Economics professor [[Robert Pollin]] has influenced the national discussion about how best to stimulate the US economy and promote sustainability. He and colleagues at the [[Political Economy Research Institute]] have developed a plan for national recovery that shows, for example, that investing in clean energy (wind power, solar, and biofuels) will create about three times as many good-paying jobs than conventional projects will, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign oil.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Since September 2009, the campus has won more than $36 million in competitive stimulus grants. These include:{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

* $7.1 million in grants from the National Science Foundation to approximately 20 separate researchers.
* $16 million from the Department of Energy to establish an Energy Frontier Research Center on campus to develop highly efficient non-silicon polymer materials for harvesting solar energy.
* $1.9 million to chemical engineer George Huber to further develop bio-fuels from inedible corn stalks, bark, wood waste, and similar biomass.

Other significant research in environmentally safe technology among UMass Amherst faculty includes:

* Microbiologist Susan Leschine has raised $25 million to commercialize technology that converts plant waste into ethanol using the Q microbe, discovered in the Quabbin Reservoir just east of the campus.
* James Manwell, director of the Renewable Energy Research Laboratory, leads testing on large wind-turbine blades at a new federal facility in Boston after helping construct two municipal wind turbines in Hull, Massachusetts.
* Microbiologist Derek Lovley discovered [[Geobacter]], a tiny biological structure that can clean up groundwater and produce electricity through conductive microbial nanowires.
* The Northeast Climate Science Center, one of four national offices designated by the [[Department of the Interior]] is located at the University of Massachusetts.|

==Campus==
{{Main|Campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst}}
{{See also|Chestnut Ridge Historical Area|East Ridge Historical Area|Ellis Drive Historical Area}}
The University's campus is situated on 1,450 acres ([[Nipmuc]] land), mainly in the town of [[Amherst, MA|Amherst]], but also partly in the neighboring town of [[Hadley, MA|Hadley]]. The campus extends about {{convert|1|mi}} from the [[Murray D. Lincoln Campus Center|Campus Center]] in all directions and may be thought of as a series of concentric rings, with innermost ring harboring academic buildings and research labs, surrounded by a ring of the seven residential areas and two University owned apartment complexes. These include North Apartments, Sylvan, Northeast, Central, Orchard Hill, Southwest, Commonwealth Honors College Residential Complex, as well as the two University owned apartment complexes, North Village and Lincoln Apartments.  These are in turn surrounded by a ring of athletic facilities, smaller administration buildings, and parking lots.

The campus has its own Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation facility. The plant, which was dedicated in 2009 after ten years of planning, replaced a coal burning power plant dating back to 1918 and has reduced the campus' greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 75%. In 2011, the CHP was recognized as the cleanest plant of its size in New England and has been recognized for maintaining 80% efficiency over six consecutive quarters. In 2008, the CHP received the Combined Cycle Journal Pacesetter Award for the best Combined Heat and Power plant project in the US that year. The award refers to its innovative design, efficiency, reliability, system redundancy, and environmental benefits. In 2009, the CHP received the Sustainable Campus Leadership Award from the International District Energy Association. The award states it was given "In recognition of exemplary public leadership in advancing energy efficiency and global environmental stewardship through investment in an innovative district energy system." The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) presented the University of Massachusetts with the 2011 Combined Heat and Power Energy Star Award in an effort to recognize the reduced emissions and increased efficiency of the plant.

The Science and Engineering Library is the other library on campus, and is located in the Lederle Graduate Research Center Lowrise. UMass is also home to the DEFA Film Library, the only archive and study collection of East German films outside of Europe, and the Shirley Graham Du Bois Library in the New Africa House.

The university has several buildings (constructed in the 1960s and 70s) of importance in the modernist style, including the [[Murray D. Lincoln Campus Center]] and Hotel designed by [[Marcel Breuer]], the Southwest Residential Area designed by [[Hugh Stubbins|Hugh Stubbins Jr.]] of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], The [[Fine Arts Center (Amherst, Massachusetts)|Fine Arts Center]] by [[Kevin Roche]], the W.E.B. Du Bois Library by [[Edward Durell Stone]], and [[Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium]] by [[Gordon Bunshaft]]. Many of the older dorms and lecture halls are built in a [[Georgian Revival]] style such as French Hall, [[Fernald Hall]], Stockbridge Hall and [[Flint Laboratory]].

The campus facilities underwent extensive renovations during the late 1990s. New and newly renovated facilities include student apartment complexes, the Hampshire Dining Commons, a library Learning Commons, a School of Management, an Integrated Science Building, a Nursing Building, a Studio Arts Building, the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation facility, a track facility, and a Recreation Center. Newly completed construction projects on campus include the new Campus Police Station, the [[George N. Parks Minuteman Marching Band Building]], the Life Sciences Laboratories, and the Integrated Learning Center.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-lists-building-and-renovations-projects|title=UMass Amherst Lists Building and Renovations Projects|work=Office of News & Media Relations {{!}} UMass Amherst|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en|archive-date=January 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113063032/https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-lists-building-and-renovations-projects|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Residential life===
{{Main|List of University of Massachusetts Amherst residence halls}}
Residential Life at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is one of the largest on-campus housing systems in the United States. Over 14,000 students live in 52 residence halls, while families, staff, and graduate students live in 345 units in two apartment complexes (North Village and Lincoln). The fifty-two residence halls and four undergraduate apartment buildings are grouped into seven separate and very different residential areas: Central, Northeast, Orchard Hill, Southwest, Sylvan, North Apartments, and the recently constructed Commonwealth Honors College Residential Community (CHCRC). Each possesses its own distinctive characteristics, inspired in part by location, in part by architecture, and in part by the different cultural or academic living/learning programs housed within. Each residential area houses classrooms, recreational and social centers, kitchenettes, and cultural centers - in addition to the bedrooms, study areas, laundries, television rooms, and dining facilities you might expect. Each also has its own student governing body and is, in effect, a community unto itself. Located in the central corridor of campus, the Honors Community houses undergraduate members of [[#Commonwealth Honors College|Commonwealth Honors College]]. In this community, undergraduates, staff, and faculty share an interwoven mix of double, single, suite, and apartment-style living options spread across six halls. This area featured a 24-hour full-service cafe during its first year, but it soon became clear that 24-hour operation was not profitable. The cafe is closed between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. during the school year and closed during the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umassdining.com/locations-menus/around-campus/roots-caf%C3%A9|title=Roots Café - UMass Dining|website=www.umassdining.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711080824/http://www.umassdining.com/locations-menus/around-campus/roots-caf%C3%A9|archive-date=July 11, 2015}}</ref> The community includes assembly and workshop rooms, as well as most Honors College programming and staff offices.

===Mount Ida Campus of UMass Amherst===
On April 6, 2018, [[Mount Ida College]] announced that the [[University of Massachusetts]] would be absorbing its campus. Mount Ida students were given a guaranteed transfer to [[UMass Dartmouth]], and the campus became part of [[UMass Amherst]]. The campus was named Mount Ida Campus of UMass Amherst and functions as a satellite campus for UMass Amherst. The campus primarily serves as a hub for Greater Boston-area career preparation and experiential learning opportunities for UMass Amherst students. The programs that are offered at the newly acquired campus will align the strengths of UMass Amherst with the growing demand for talent in areas that drive the Massachusetts economy, including health care, business, computer science and other [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] specialties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/mount-ida-college-reaches-agreement-umass|title=Mount Ida College Reaches Agreement with UMass Regarding Educational Continuity for Students with Acquisition of its Campus|date=April 6, 2018|access-date=April 7, 2018|archive-date=April 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406224005/http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/mount-ida-college-reaches-agreement-umass|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Campus safety===
UMass Amherst implements a multitude of services to ensure safety on and off campus for all students. On-campus residence halls are constantly monitored and secured. There are cadets stationed at the entrances that monitor the area while students are signed into the building. Anyone who does not live in that specific building has to be signed in by a friend with legitimate identification to ensure the safety of everyone in that residence hall. In addition, there are about 350 security cameras constantly monitoring every residence hall and the doors are always locked. The only way to enter is with a student ID registered to that specific building.

There is a system of “HELP” phones on campus. The "HELP" phone network is composed of approximately 110 emergency phones scattered about campus, and are available for people to use for emergency calls if they feel they are in danger or in an uncomfortable situation. These phones are easily recognizable by their bright blue light and have an emergency button that anyone can press which will automatically connect them to the UMass Police Department. This will alert the police to the users exact position so that they can send appropriate assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/umpd/personal-security|title=Personal Security|work=umass.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006032248/http://www.umass.edu/umpd/personal-security|archive-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

UMass Amherst also provides alerts via students' school e-mail, as well as text messages if they so choose. These alerts create awareness of any suspicious or criminal behavior occurring on or around campus. It creates an environment where students are always conscious of their surroundings and know exactly what is going on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/studentlife/health|title=Campus Health and Safety Resources|work=umass.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017055848/http://www.umass.edu/studentlife/health|archive-date=October 17, 2014}}</ref>

The UMPD has several specialized units that make up the department including bicycle, K-9, motorcycle, and mounted horseback units as well as foot and vehicle patrol.

The Police Cadet program has been a part of the UMPD since 2000. It is viewed as a successful program by the department and the UMass community since the cadets are an important part of the police department. Their presence can be seen mostly in the residential areas, where the cadets work very closely with police officers and Residence Hall Security.

Cadets take part in a two-week "boot-camp"-style training in preparation for the position. The training consists of police techniques, performing foot patrols, parking enforcement, prisoner watch, and other functions to free officers. The cadets operate as the eyes and the ears of the police department as they can see and hear what the officers cannot, preventing problems and their escalation.

In the past, there had been several occurrences of large non-school sponsored gatherings labeled as riots, where UMass officials had been called in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/news/9119334-95/umass-police-arrest-15-after-red-sox-world-series-win|title=UMass police arrest 15 after Red Sox World Series win|work=GazetteNet.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709175323/http://www.gazettenet.com/news/9119334-95/umass-police-arrest-15-after-red-sox-world-series-win|archive-date=July 9, 2015}}</ref> After the Red Sox won the World Series in 2013, an estimated 3,000 students gathered in the outdoor space around South West Residence Hall. In response to the situation, UMass police officials were called in. Police accounts state that some students participated in disruptive behavior: knocking over trash bins and climbing trees. Rubber bullets and tear gas were dispersed into the crowds. According to WGGB,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2013/10/31/15-arrested-at-umass-amherst-following-red-sox-world-series-win-video-images/|title=2013 World Series Riots: UMass Amherst Students Riot after Red Sox Win - BostInno|date=October 31, 2013|work=BostInno|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015043408/http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2013/10/31/15-arrested-at-umass-amherst-following-red-sox-world-series-win-video-images/|archive-date=October 15, 2014}}</ref> 14 people were arrested for failing to disperse and 1 for disorderly conduct. Whether or not the use of police force was necessary is still a controversial topic among students, the administration, and UMass and Amherst Police Department.

A similar situation had occurred after the Patriots lost the Super Bowl in 2012. Officials donning riot gear used smoke grenades to disperse the crowds. Luckily there were no injuries. Riots like these are not unheard of within the UMass community and go as far back as 1986. 
The majority of the events are categorized as seemingly peaceful by many students, stating that they consist mainly of students standing around, chanting and singing. There is also still debate among UMass students as to whether or not the term “riot” applies to a lot of the occurrences since they seldom involve violence or aggressive behavior from the vast majority of students present. Nevertheless, each event is met with police interference due to a fear of the unsafe environments that large unattended crowds could create. In the past there has been friction between members of the student body and the UMass Police Department around their methods of crowd control; students have been displeased with what they see as unnecessary force.

According to MassLive,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/riot_erupts_at_umass_amherst_f_1.html|title=Riot police disperse 1,500 students at UMass-Amherst following Super Bowl|work=masslive.com|date=February 6, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015101131/http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/riot_erupts_at_umass_amherst_f_1.html|archive-date=October 15, 2014}}</ref> other riots include one in 2007 after the Boston Red Sox lost in the 2008 playoffs, another when they lost in the World Series run in 2006, one after UMass' football team lost in the Division I-AA football championship in 2006, one after the Red Sox World Series victory in 2004, another after the Red Sox lost during the 2003 playoffs, one after the Patriots first Super Bowl victory over St. Louis in 2001 and another in 1986 after the Red Sox World Series loss. The majority of these riots have been non-violent on the side of the students, except for the 1986 riot in which an argument between hundreds of students intensified into racial altercations where a black student was attacked by 15-20 white students and beaten unconscious according to archives from The Republican. Videos and visual accounts of most of these events can be found online. In the wake of these events students have worked and are continuously working to start open dialogues with the administration and police department about campus safety, the right to gather, police force and better methods of crowd control.

===Iranian student admissions controversy===

UMass Amherst issued an announcement in early 2015 stating: "the University has determined that it will no longer admit Iranian national students to specific programs in the College of Engineering (i.e., Chemical Engineering, Electrical & Computer Engineering, Mechanical & Industrial Engineering) and in the College of Natural Sciences (i.e., Physics, Chemistry, Microbiology, and Polymer Science & Engineering) effective February 1, 2015."<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/gradschool/sites/default/files/iranian_student_admissions_2_2015.pdf UMass Amherst Procedures on Admission of Iranian Students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214002306/http://www.umass.edu/gradschool/sites/default/files/iranian_student_admissions_2_2015.pdf |date=February 14, 2015 }}. umass.edu. Retrieved on February 13, 2015</ref> The University claims that this announcement was posted because a graduate student entered Iran for a project and was later denied a visa. This event along with urging from legal advisers contributed to the belief that such incidents inhibited their ability to give Iranian students a "full program of education and research for Iranian students" and thus justified changing their admissions policies. The ensuing criticism on and off campus, as well as wide media publicity, changed the minds of school officials. As a result, UMass made a statement on February 18 committing to once again allowing Iranian students to apply to the aforementioned graduate programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-will-accept-iranian-students|title=UMass Amherst Will Accept Iranian Students into Science and Engineering Programs, Revising Approach to Admissions|date=February 18, 2015|access-date=May 25, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525011208/http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-will-accept-iranian-students|archive-date=May 25, 2015}}</ref> On the same day, an official in the U.S. Department of State stated in an interview that: "U.S. laws and regulations do not prevent Iranian people from traveling to the United States or studying in engineering program of any U.S. academic institutions."<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2015/02/150213_u14_state_dept_massachusetts_uni_iranian_students U.S. foreign minister: There is no program or law that prevents Iranian from studying in U.S.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216125804/http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2015/02/150213_u14_state_dept_massachusetts_uni_iranian_students |date=February 16, 2015 }} bbc.co.uk.

====SGA====
The [[University of Massachusetts Amherst Student Government Association|Student Government Association (SGA)]] is the undergraduate student governmental body, and provides funding for the many registered student organizations (RSOs) and agencies, including the Student Legal Services Office (SLSO) and the Center for Student Business (CSB). The SGA also makes formal recommendations on matters of campus policy and advocates for undergraduate students to the Administration, non-student organizations, and local and state government. The SGA has a budget of over $5.4 million per year which is collected from students in the form of the $248 per year Student Activities Fee (as of Fall 2021). It is used to fund RSOs, Agencies and the SGA itself.

====College Republicans====
The [[College Republicans]] Club is a branch of the national College Republicans organization. It gained national recognition in April 2016 after it hosted ''The Triggering'', a panel discussion featuring [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], [[Steven Crowder]], and [[Christina Hoff Sommers]]. The event devolved into a shouting match between protesters and supporters of the speakers, and a recording of the event went viral on the [[Internet]].

====Muslim Students Association====
The [[Muslim Students Association]] (MSA) exists to facilitate the practice of Islam on campus. By bringing Muslims together and providing important services, the MSA creates an Islamic atmosphere allowing students to continue their spiritual journey while also successfully completing their studies. Hosting both social and religious events, the MSA is a community within a community. Jummah, halal
food, halaqas, and other services are regularly provided, and there are several big events throughout the year including the annual Eid/Ramadan Celebration and Islam Awareness Week.

====UMass Permaculture====
UMass Permaculture is one of the first university permaculture initiatives in the nation that transforms marginalized landscapes on the campus into diverse, educational, low-maintenance and edible gardens according to UMass officials.<ref name="Permaculture garden at UMass gives new meaning to the phrase fresh vegetables">[http://www.gazettenet.com/2010/11/05/quarter-acre-experiment-0 Permaculture garden at UMass gives new meaning to the phrase fresh vegetables] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202041336/http://www.gazettenet.com/2010/11/05/quarter-acre-experiment-0 |date=February 2, 2016 }} ''The Daily Hampshire Gazette''</ref> One of the most important aspects of UMass Permaculture is that it comes from the students and is ecologically and socially responsible. Rather than tilling the soil, a more sustainable landscaping method known as [[sheet mulching]] is employed. During November 2010, "about a quarter of a million pounds of organic matter was moved by hand",<ref name="UMass Embraces Permaculture">[http://www.fsdmag.com/going-green/umass-embraces-permaculture.html UMass Embraces Permaculture]{{dead link|date=June 2012}} ''Food Service Director''</ref> using all student and community volunteer labor and no fossil fuels on-site. The process took about two weeks to complete. Now, the Franklin Permaculture Garden includes a diverse mixture of "vegetables, fruit trees, berry bushes, culinary herbs and a lot of flowers that will attract beneficial insects."<ref name="UMass Embraces Permaculture"/>

====ROTC====
The Minuteman Battalion is the institution's Army ROTC battalion. Active on the Amherst campus, the program's [[Scabbard and Blade]] community service club is very active and represents UMass well throughout the year with food drives, assistance to local veteran's groups and assistance with the Medical Readiness Corps at UMass in preparing for large-scale medical disasters. Most students are on a full tuition scholarship. UMass-Amherst is the host program for the Pioneer Valley and Five Colleges Army ROTC programs including: Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College, Hampshire College, Western New England University, Springfield College, Westfield State College and American International College (AIC).

====Minuteman Marching Band====

[[File:Ummb06-09048.jpg|250px|thumb|The University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band during a pre-game show.]]
UMass Amherst has the largest marching band in New England. The Minuteman Marching Band consists of over 390 members and regularly plays at football games. The band was led by John Jenkins from 1963 to 1977.  In 1977 [[George N. Parks]] took over until his death in September 2010. Timothy Todd Anderson became the director in 2011.  The Minuteman Band also won the prestigious Sudler Trophy in 1998 for excellence. The band is well known across the nation for its style and excellence, particularly for its battery and pit ensemble. The band also performs in various other places and events like the [[Collegiate Marching Band Festival]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], [[Bands of America]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Symphony Hall, Boston]], [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in [[Pasadena, California]], and on occasion [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.

====Fraternities and Sororities====
UMass is home to numerous fraternities and sororities, organized under four councils: [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|IFC]], [[National Panhellenic Conference|NPC]], [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|NPHC]], and the [[National Multicultural Greek Council|MGC]]. Currently, several sororities & fraternities have officially recognized housing in the area including national fraternity [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], whose first chapter was founded at UMass in 1873.

Several Greek Life organizations had houses on North Pleasant Street until Alpha Tau Gamma, Inc., which owned a total of nine properties at one point, did not renew the leases at the request of the University. The North Pleasant Street houses were colloquially known as 'Frat Row'. Most of Alpha Tau Gamma's Properties houses were out of [[Building code|code]] and were razed in November 2006. Alpha Tau Gamma sold the land to the University for $2,500,000 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/fp/umassbuys5houses/ |title=Facilities and Campus Planning UMass Buys 5 Houses |access-date=April 24, 2007 |work=UMass Buys 5 Houses |author=Holly Angelo, The Republican |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112060838/http://www.umass.edu/fp/umassbuys5houses/ |archive-date=November 12, 2007 }}</ref> ATG, which is the Fraternity of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture, then donated $500,001 to endow a new Director of Stockbridge.

UMass is a member of [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). The university is a member of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]], while playing ice hockey in the [[Hockey East]] Association. The football team joined the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC), in order to play at [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (the sport's highest level) with games played at [[Gillette Stadium]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite news| first = John| last = Connolly| title = UMass moves up to FBS| work = Boston Herald| access-date = April 20, 2011| date = April 20, 2011| url = http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/college/football/view/2011_0420umass_moves_up_to_fbs_plays_2012-13_at_gillette/| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110425031219/http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/college/football/view/2011_0420umass_moves_up_to_fbs_plays_2012-13_at_gillette/| archive-date = April 25, 2011}}</ref> In March 2014, the MAC and UMass announced an agreement for the Minutemen football team to leave the conference after the 2015 season due to UMass declining an offer to become a full member of the conference. In the agreement between the MAC and the university, there was a contractual clause that had UMass playing in the MAC as a football-only member for two more seasons if UMass declined a full membership offer. UMass announced that it would look for a "more suitable conference" for the team.<ref>[http://www.umassathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/032614aaa.html UMass Football Will Leave Mid-American Conference at End of 2015 - University of Massachusetts Official Athletic Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093834/http://www.umassathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/032614aaa.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}. Umassathletics.com (March 26, 2014). Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref> UMass Amherst plays most of its home games at the 17,000-seat [[McGuirk Stadium]] on campus.

UMass originally was known as the Aggies, later the Statesmen, then the Redmen. In a response to changing attitudes regarding the use of Native American–themed mascots, they changed their mascot in 1972 to the Minuteman, based on the historical "[[minuteman]]" relationship with Massachusetts; women's teams and athletes are known as Minutewomen.

UMass football has enjoyed various levels of success over the years. As a founding member of the Yankee Conference, Massachusetts won 17 Yankee Conference Championships, appearing in one National Championship game during that timespan. They fell to Florida A&M in this inaugural Division I-AA Championship, 35–28. UMass' success continued as they began competition in the Atlantic 10 Conference in 1997. They went on to win four more conference titles while playing in the A-10 and make two more appearances in the National Championship game, winning it all in 1998. In 2006 the Minutemen took home the last A-10 title (the A-10 handed off management of their football league to the Colonial Athletic Association after the season) and made their most recent Championship game appearance. Their most recent conference championship came in 2007, the inaugural season under the CAA name.
