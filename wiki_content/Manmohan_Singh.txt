'''Manmohan Singh''' ({{IPA-pa|mənˈmoːɦən ˈsɪ́ŋɡ|lang|Hi-ManmohanSingh.ogg}}; born 26 September 1932) is an Indian economist, academic, and politician who served as the 13th [[Prime Minister of India]] from 2004 to 2014. Currently, he is a [[Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha|Member of Parliament]] in the [[Rajya Sabha]], representing the state of [[Rajasthan]]. A member of the [[Indian National Congress]], Singh was the first [[Sikh]] Prime minister of India. Singh was also the first prime minister since [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term.

Born in [[Gah, Pakistan|Gah]], [[Punjab (region)|West Punjab]], in what is today [[Pakistan]], Singh's family migrated to India during [[Partition of India|its partition]] in 1947. After obtaining his doctorate in economics from [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Oxford]], Singh worked for the [[United Nations]] during 1966–1969. He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when [[Lalit Narayan Mishra]] hired him as an advisor in the [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, Singh held several key posts in the [[Government of India]], such as [[Chief Economic Advisor to the Government of India|Chief Economic Advisor]] (1972–1976), governor of the [[Reserve Bank of India|Reserve Bank]] (1982–1985) and head of the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] (1985–1987).

In 1991, as India faced a [[1991 Indian economic crisis|severe economic crisis]], newly elected Prime Minister [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] surprisingly inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as [[Minister of Finance (India)|Finance Minister]]. Over the next few years, despite strong opposition, he as a Finance Minister carried out several structural reforms that [[Economic liberalisation in India|liberalised India's economy]]. Although these measures proved successful in averting the crisis, and enhanced Singh's reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist, the incumbent [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] fared poorly in the [[1996 Indian general election|1996 general election]]. Subsequently, Singh served as [[Leader of the Opposition (India)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house of the [[Parliament of India]]) during the [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] government of 1998–2004.

In 2004, when the Congress-led [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) came to power, its chairperson [[Sonia Gandhi]] unexpectedly relinquished the premiership to Manmohan Singh. Singh's [[first Manmohan Singh ministry|first ministry]] executed several key legislations and projects, including the [[National Rural Health Mission|Rural Health Mission]], [[Unique Identification Authority of India|Unique Identification Authority]], [[Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act|Rural Employment Guarantee]] scheme and [[Right to Information Act]]. In 2008, opposition to a historic [[U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement|civil nuclear agreement with the United States]] nearly caused Singh's government to fall after [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] parties withdrew their support. Although India's economy grew rapidly under UPA I, its security was threatened by several terrorist incidents (including the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]) and the continuing [[Maoist insurgency]].

The [[2009 Indian general election|2009 general election]] saw the UPA return with an increased mandate, with Singh retaining the office of Prime Minister. Over the next few years, Singh's [[second Manmohan Singh ministry|second ministry]] government faced a number of corruption charges—over the organisation of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]], the [[2G spectrum allocation case]] and the [[Indian coal allocation scam|allocation of coal blocks]]. After his term ended in 2014 he opted out from the race for the office of the [[Prime Minister of India]] during the [[2014 Indian general election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=India's Manmohan Singh to step down as PM|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/03/india-manmohan-singh-rahul-gandhi-narendra-modi|access-date=20 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=3 January 2014}}</ref> Singh was never a [[Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha|member of the Lok Sabha]] but served as a member of the [[Parliament of India]], representing the state of [[Assam]] in the [[Rajya Sabha]] for five terms from 1991 to 2019.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manmohan Singh takes oath as Rajya Sabha member|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Manmohan-Singh-takes-oath-as-Rajya-Sabha-member/articleshow/20626992.cms|access-date=20 April 2015|work=The Times of India|date=17 June 2013}}</ref> In August 2019, Singh succeeded as [[Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha|Member to the Rajya Sabha]] from [[Rajasthan]] after the death of sitting MP [[Madan Lal Saini]], from [[Indian National Congress]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Iqbal |first1=Mohammed |title=Manmohan Singh files Rajya Sabha nomination from Rajasthan |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/manmohan-singh-files-rajya-sabha-nomination-from-rajasthan/article29059696.ece |access-date=18 August 2019 |work=The Hindu |date=13 August 2019 |language=en-IN}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=RS bypoll: Manmohan's nomination found valid |url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-bypoll-manmohan-s-nomination-found-valid/818485.html |access-date=18 August 2019 |work=The Tribune |date=17 August 2019}}</ref>

In a 2005 interview with the British journalist [[Mark Tully]], Singh said about his Cambridge days:

{{quote|I first became conscious of the creative role of politics in shaping human affairs, and I owe that mostly to my teachers [[Joan Robinson]] and [[Nicholas Kaldor]]. Joan Robinson was a brilliant teacher, but she also sought to awaken the inner conscience of her students in a manner that very few others were able to achieve. She questioned me a great deal and made me think the unthinkable. She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes, maintaining that the state has to play more of a role if you really want to combine development with social equity. Kaldor influenced me even more; I found him pragmatic, scintillating, stimulating. Joan Robinson was a great admirer of what was going on in China, but Kaldor used the Keynesian analysis to demonstrate that capitalism could be made to work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pib.gov.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=13290|title=Manmohan Singh - PIB|website=Press Information Bureau|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref>}}

==Political career==
In June 1991, India's prime minister at the time, [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]], chose Singh to be his finance minister. Singh told Mark Tully the British journalist in 2005 "On the day (Rao) was formulating his cabinet, he sent his Principal Secretary to me saying, 'The PM would like you to become the Minister of Finance'. I didn't take it seriously. He eventually tracked me down the next morning, rather angry, and demanded that I get dressed up and come to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing in. So that's how I started in politics".<ref name=TULLY/>

===Minister of Finance===
In 1991, India's fiscal deficit was close to 8.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, the [[balance of payments]] deficit was huge and the [[current account deficit]] was close to 3.5 percent of India's GDP.<ref name="rediff Business Desk">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2005/sep/26pm.htm |title= Manmohan Singh: Father of Indian Reform |author=rediff Business Desk |date=26 September 2005 |work=Rediff.com |access-date=3 January 2010}}</ref> India's foreign reserves barely amounted to US$1&nbsp;billion, enough to pay for 2 weeks of imports,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/tr_show02.html |title=Commanding Heights : Episode 2 &#124; on PBS |publisher=Pbs.org |access-date=3 November 2015}}</ref> in comparison to US$283&nbsp;billion today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.biz.yahoo.com/100101/50/bauua1.html |title=Forex reserves swell 11% in 2009 |author=Mahalakshmi Hariharan |date=2 January 2010 |publisher=Yahoo Finance India |access-date=3 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103094134/http://in.biz.yahoo.com/100101/50/bauua1.html |archive-date=3 January 2010 }}</ref>

Evidently, India was facing an economic crisis. At this point, the government of India sought funds from the supranational [[International Monetary Fund]], which, while assisting India financially, imposed several conditions regarding India's economic policy. In effect, IMF-dictated policy meant that the ubiquitous [[Licence Raj]] had to be dismantled, and India's attempt at a state-controlled economy had to end.

Manmohan explained to the PM and the party that India is facing an unprecedented crisis.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> However the rank and file of the party resisted deregulation.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> So Chidambaram and Manmohan explained to the party that the economy would collapse if it was not deregulated.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> To the dismay of the party, Rao allowed Manmohan to deregulate the [[Economy of India|Indian economy]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Subsequently, Singh, who had thus far been one of the most influential architects of India's socialist economy, eliminated the permit raj,<ref name="autogenerated1"/> reduced state control of the economy, and reduced import taxes<ref name="rediff Business Desk"/><ref>{{cite book|title= The World is Flat – A brief history of the twenty-first century|last= Friedman|first= Thomas L.|year= 2008|publisher= Picador|isbn= 978-0-374-29288-1|page= [https://archive.org/details/worldisflatbri00frie/page/130 130<!--|page= 488-->]|url= https://archive.org/details/worldisflatbri00frie/page/130}}</ref>

Rao and Singh thus implemented policies to open up the economy and change India's socialist economy to a more [[capitalism|capitalistic]] one, in the process dismantling the Licence Raj, a system that inhibited the prosperity of private businesses. They removed many obstacles standing in the way of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), and initiated the process of the privatisation of [[public sector]] companies. However, in spite of these reforms, Rao's government was voted out in 1996 due to non-performance of government in other areas. In praise of Singh's work that pushed India towards a market economy, long-time Cabinet minister [[P. Chidambaram]] has compared Singh's role in India's reforms to [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s in [[China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2008/05/02/manmohan-is-deng-xiaoping-of-india-p-chidambaram-1209740775.html |title=Manmohan is Deng Xiaoping of India: P Chidambaram – Oneindia News |publisher=News.oneindia.in |date=2 May 2008 |access-date=15 February 2011}}</ref>

In 1993, Singh offered his resignation from the post of Finance Minister after a parliamentary investigation report criticised his ministry for not being able to anticipate a US$1.8&nbsp;billion [[1992 Indian stock market scam|securities scandal]].

P. J. Abdul Kalam]] authorizing the Prime Minister designate Manmohan Singh to form the next Government in New Delhi on 19 May 2004.]]
After the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 general elections]], the Indian National Congress ended the incumbent [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) tenure by becoming the political party with the single largest number of seats in the [[Lok Sabha]]. It formed [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) with allies and staked claim to form government. In a surprise move, Chairperson [[Sonia Gandhi]] declared Manmohan Singh, a [[Technocracy|technocrat]], as the UPA candidate for the Prime Ministership. Despite the fact that Singh had never won a Lok Sabha seat, according to the [[BBC]], he "enjoyed massive popular support, not least because he was seen by many as a clean politician untouched by the taint of corruption that has run through many Indian administrations."<ref name = "bbcprofile">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3725357.stm|title=Profile: Manmohan Singh|work=BBC News|date= 30 March 2009|access-date=7 April 2010}}</ref> He took the oath as the Prime Minister of India on 22 May 2004.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manmohan to Advani: Change your astrologers, stop abuse against me|work=Thaindian News|date=22 July 2008|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/manmohan-to-advani-change-your-astrologers-stop-abuse-against-me_10074778.html|access-date=23 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Manmohan takes on Advani: Babri destruction his only contribution|work=Southasia Times|date=25 March 2009}}</ref>

====Economic policy====
In 1991, Singh, as Finance Minister, abolished the [[Licence Raj]], source of slow economic growth and [[Corruption in India|corruption in the Indian economy]] for decades. He liberalised the Indian economy, allowing it to speed up development dramatically. During his term as Prime Minister, Singh continued to encourage growth in the Indian market, enjoying widespread success in these matters. Singh, along with the former Finance Minister, [[P. Chidambaram]], presided over a period where the Indian economy grew with an 8–9% economic growth rate. In 2007, India achieved its highest GDP growth rate of 9% and became the second [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest growing major economy]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/india/ |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |access-date=15 February 2011}}</ref><ref name="astaire">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf |title=The India Report |publisher=Astaire Research |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114195859/http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf |archive-date=14 January 2009 }}</ref> Singh's ministry enacted a [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005|National Employment Guarantee Act]] (MGNREGA) in 2005.

====Healthcare and education====
In 2005, Prime Minister Singh and his government's health ministry started the [[National Rural Health Mission]] (NHRM), which mobilised half a million community health workers. This rural health initiative was praised by the American economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].<ref name="timepoverty">{{cite news|title=The End of Poverty|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1034738,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050317031951/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1034738,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 March 2005|first=Jeffrey D.|last=Sachs|date=6 March 2005|work=Time}}</ref> In 2006, his Government implemented the proposal to reserve 27% of seats in All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other central institutions of higher education for Other Backward Classes which led to [[2006 Indian anti-reservation protests]].

On 2 July 2009, Singh ministry introduced The [[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009|Right to Education Act]] (RTE) act. Eight [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT's]] were opened in the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], Bihar, [[Gujarat]], Orissa, [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Madhya Pradesh, [[Rajasthan]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite web|title=LS passes bill to provide IIT for eight states.|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/148456/ls-passes-bill-provide-iit.html|work=Deccan Herald|access-date=14 June 2013}}</ref> The Singh government also continued the [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] programme.

Singh's government strengthened anti-terror laws with amendments to [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]] (UAPA). [[National Investigation Agency (India)|National Investigation Agency]] (NIA) was also created soon after the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Nov 2008 Mumbai terror attacks]], as need for a central agency to combat terrorism was realised. Also, [[Unique Identification Authority of India]] was established in February 2009, an agency responsible for implementing the envisioned [[Multipurpose National Identity Card]] with the objective of increasing national security and facilitating e-governance.

Singh's administration initiated a massive reconstruction effort in [[Kashmir]] to stabilise the region but after some period of success, insurgent infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir has increased since 2009.<ref name=Buzz7/> However, the Singh administration was successful in reducing terrorism in Northeast India.<ref name=Buzz7>[http://buzz7.com/news/infiltration-has-not-reduced-in-kashmir-insurgency-down-in-north-east-chidambaram.html Infiltration has not reduced in Kashmir, insurgency down in North East: Chidambaram] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107072045/http://buzz7.com/news/infiltration-has-not-reduced-in-kashmir-insurgency-down-in-north-east-chidambaram.html |date=7 January 2016 }}</ref>

The important [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]] (NREGA) and the [[Right to Information Act]] were passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 2005 during his tenure.

Manmohan Singh continued the [[Foreign relations of India|pragmatic foreign policy]] that was started by [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] and continued by [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]'s [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]. Singh continued the [[India-Pakistan relations|peace process with Pakistan]] initiated by his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Exchange of high-level visits by top leaders from both countries have highlighted his tenure. Efforts have been made during Singh's tenure to end the border dispute with People's Republic of China. In November 2006, Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]] visited India which was followed by Singh's visit to Beijing in January 2008. A major development in [[Sino-Indian relations]] was the reopening of the [[Nathula Pass]] in 2006 after being closed for more than four decades.<ref name="state visit">{{cite web |title=Visits of Heads of States/Heads of Governments |url=https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/China_Jan_2016.pdf |publisher=Ministry of External Affairs (India) |access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref> [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] of the People's Republic of China, [[Li Keqiang]] paid a state visit to India (Delhi-[[Mumbai]]) from 19–21 May 2013.<ref name="state visit"/> Singh paid an official visit to China from 22–24 October 2013.<ref name="state visit"/> Signed were three agreements establishing [[Sister Cities International|sister-city partnership]] between Delhi-[[Beijing]], Kolkata-[[Kunming]] and Bangalore-[[Chengdu]].

Singh's government worked towards stronger [[India-US relations|ties with the United States]]. He visited the United States in July 2005 initiating negotiations over the [[Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement]]. This was followed by [[George W.

Relations have improved with Japan and [[European Union]] countries, like the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.
