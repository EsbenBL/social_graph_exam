Hoppe identifies as a [[culturally conservative]] [[libertarian]]. He has expressed criticism towards [[democracy]], stating that a [[monarchy]] would preserve individual liberty more effectively.<ref name="gordondemocracy" /> Hoppe's statements and ideas concerning [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[homosexuality]] have repeatedly provoked controversy among his libertarian peers and his colleagues at UNLV. His belief in the right of property owners to establish libertarian communities that engage in [[racial discrimination]], and his assertion that homosexuals and political [[dissident]]s will have to be "physically removed" from these communities if they are to survive, have proven particularly divisive.<ref name="pp. 216–218"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/my-battle-thought-police|title=My Battle With The Thought Police|last=kanopiadmin|date=11 April 2005|website=Mises.org|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref> Hoppe also garners controversy due to his support for governmental enforcement of [[immigration law]]s, which critics argue is at odds with libertarianism and what they describe as "libertarian anarchism".<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Ganz">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/09/19/libertarians-have-more-in-common-with-the-alt-right-than-they-want-you-to-think/|title=Perspective - Libertarians have more in common with the alt-right than they want you to think|first=John|last=Ganz|date=19 September 2017|access-date=16 October 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref>

==Life and work==
[[File:MurrayBW.jpg|thumb|upright|125px|[[Murray Rothbard]], whom Hoppe called his [[mentor]] and master]]
Hoppe was born in [[Peine]], [[West Germany]], did undergraduate studies at [[Universität des Saarlandes]]<ref>[http://thegodthatfailed.org/2011/10/01/jeff-tucker-interviews-hans-hermann-hoppe/ ''Jeff Tucker interviews Hans-Hermann Hoppe''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003232639/http://thegodthatfailed.org/2011/10/01/jeff-tucker-interviews-hans-hermann-hoppe/ |date=3 October 2011 }} (1 October 2011)</ref> and received his MA and PhD degrees from [[Goethe University Frankfurt]].<ref name="UNLV cat"/> He studied under [[Jürgen Habermas]], a leading German intellectual of the post-WWII era, but gradually came to reject Habermas's ideas, and European leftism generally, regarding them as "intellectually barren and morally bankrupt."<ref>[[Lew Rockwell]], introduction to Hoppe's ''A Short History of Man'' (2015), Auburn, Mississippi: Mises Institute, p. 9</ref>

He was a post-doctoral fellow at the [[University of Michigan]], in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], from 1976 to 1978 and earned his [[habilitation]] in Foundations of Sociology and Economics from the University of Frankfurt in 1981. From 1986<ref name=rallo>{{cite web|title=Juan Ramón Rallo interviews Mises Institute scholar Hans-Hermann Hoppe at the Instituto Juan de Mariana's|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AETnctIcpVI#t=302s}}</ref> until his retirement in 2008,<ref name="Bell1"/> Hoppe was a professor in the School of Business at [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the [[Mises Institute]], the publisher of much of his work, and was editor of various Mises Institute periodicals.<ref>Hans Herman Hoppe, [https://mises.org/books/economicsethics.pdf ''The Ethics and Economics of Private Property], Second Edition, [[Mises Institute]], p. xii, {{ISBN|978-0945466406}}.</ref>

Hoppe has stated that [[Murray Rothbard]] was his "principal teacher, mentor and master".<ref name="Bell1"/> After reading Rothbard's books and being converted to a Rothbardian political position, Hoppe moved from Germany to New York City to be with Rothbard, and then followed Rothbard to the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], "working and living side-by-side with him, in constant and immediate personal contact."  According to Hoppe, from 1985 until Rothbard's 1995 death, Hoppe considered Rothbard his "dearest fatherly friend".<ref>Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (1995). L. Rockwell (Ed.), from ''[https://mises.org/books/memoriam.pdf Murray Rothbard, In Memoriam]''. Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute. pp. 33–37</ref>

===Property and Freedom Society===
{{Main|Property and Freedom Society}}
In 2006, Hoppe founded The Property and Freedom Society ("PFS") as a reaction against the [[Milton Friedman]]-influenced [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which he has derided as "socialist".{{cn|date=October 2021}} On the fifth anniversary of PFS, Hoppe reflected on its goals:<ref name="4H PFS">{{cite web|last=Hoppe|first=Hans Hermann|title=The Property And Freedom Society – Reflections After Five Years|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/hans-hermann-hoppe/my-life-on-the-right/|publisher=lewrockwell.com|access-date=6 September 2013}}</ref>

{{quote|On the one hand, positively, it was to explain and elucidate the legal, economic, cognitive and cultural requirements and features of a free, state-less natural order.

On the other hand, negatively, it was to unmask the State and showcase it for what it really is: an institution run by gangs of murderers, plunderers and thieves, surrounded by willing executioners, propagandists, sycophants, crooks, liars, clowns, charlatans, dupes and useful idiots – an institution that dirties and taints everything it touches.}}

Hoppe has been criticized for repeatedly inviting [[white nationalist]] speakers such as [[Jared Taylor]], and [[neo-Nazi]] [[Richard B. Spencer]], to speak at the PFS.<ref name="Ganz" />

==Argumentation ethics==
[[File:Hans-Hermann-Hoppe.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Hoppe in 2005]]
In the September 1988 issue of [[Liberty (libertarian magazine)|''Liberty'']],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoppe|first=Hans-Hermann|title=The Ultimate Justification of the Private Property Ethic|journal=Liberty|date=September 1988|volume=2|issue=1|pages=20–22|url=http://www.libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_September_1988.pdf|quote=The mere fact that an individual argues presupposes that he owns himself and has a right to his own life and property. This provides a basis for libertarian theory radically different from both natural rights theory and utilitarianism.}}</ref> Hoppe attempted to establish an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and [[Value judgment|value-neutral]] justification for libertarian ethics by devising a new theory which he named ''argumentation ethics''.<ref name=libertymag/> Hoppe asserted that any argument which in any respect purports to contradict libertarian principles is logically incoherent.<ref>[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_3.pdf Hans-Hermann Hoppe's Argumentation Ethic: A Critique], Robert Murphy and Gene Callahan. Relevant text on Page 3: "Therefore, [Hoppe] concludes that the libertarian view of property rights is the only one that can possibly be defended by rational argument."</ref>

Hoppe argued that, in the course of having an argument about politics (or indeed any subject), people assume certain norms of argumentation, including a prohibition on initiating violence. Hoppe then extrapolated this argument to political life in general, arguing that the norms governing argumentation should apply in all political contexts. Hoppe claimed that, of all political philosophies, only anarcho-capitalist libertarianism prohibits the initiation of aggressive violence (the [[non-aggression principle]]); therefore, any argument for any political philosophy other than anarcho-capitalist libertarianism is logically incoherent.

===Reception===
In the following issue, ''Liberty'' published comments by ten of Hoppe's fellow libertarians, mostly friends and colleagues at the Mises Institute,<ref name="blog.mises">{{cite web|last=Kinsella|first=Stephan|title=Revisiting Argumentation Ethics|url=http://archive.mises.org/9610/revisiting-argumentation-ethics/|work=Mises Economics Blog|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|author-link=Stephan Kinsella|date=March 13, 2009|quote=[A] number of thinkers weighed in, including [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], ...

Rasmussen|Rasmussen]], and others....}}</ref> followed by a rejoinder from Hoppe.<ref name=libertymag>{{cite journal|author=Symposium|title=Hans-Hermannn Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics: Breakthrough or Buncombe?|journal=Liberty|date=November 1988|volume=2|issue=2|pages=44–54 |url=http://www.libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_November_1988.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012233723/http://www.libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_November_1988.pdf |archive-date=2017-10-12}}</ref> In his comment for ''Liberty'', Hoppe's friend and Mises Institute supervisor Murray Rothbard wrote that Hoppe's theory was "a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular" and that Hoppe "has managed to transcend the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the days of the Scholastics, and that had brought modern libertarianism into a tiresome deadlock".<ref name=libertymag/> However, the majority of Hoppe's colleagues surveyed by ''Liberty'' rejected his theory. In his response, Hoppe derided his critics as "[[utilitarians]]".<ref name=libertymag/>

Later, attorney and Mises Institute adjunct scholar [[Stephan Kinsella]] also defended Hoppe's argument,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-state.com/article.php?article_id=312 |title=Defending Argumentation Ethics: Reply to Murphy & Callahan |last=Kinsella |first=Stephan |date=19 September 2002 |publisher=Anti-State.com |access-date=9 February 2012}} See also Kinsella's [https://mises.org/library/argumentation-ethics-and-liberty-concise-guide "Argumentation Ethics and Liberty: A Concise Guide"].</ref> while Mises Institute economists [[Robert P. Murphy|Bob Murphy]] and Gene Callahan rejected Hoppe's argument.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=Robert P. |last2=Callahan |first2=Gene |date=Spring 2006 |title=Hans-Hermann Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics: A Critique |journal=[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=53–6 |url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_3.pdf |access-date=9 February 2012 }}</ref> David Osterfeld, an adjunct scholar at the Mises Institute, agreed with most of Hoppe's argument in an essay, while raising a number of objections, to which Hoppe subsequently responded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/osterfeld_hoppe.pdf |title=Comment on Hoppe / Comment on Osterfeld |year= 1988 |publisher=Austrian Economics Newsletter |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref>

Mises Institute Senior Fellow Roderick T. Long stated that Hoppe's ''a priori'' formulation of libertarianism denied the fundamental principle of Misesean [[praxeology]]. On the issue of utilitarianism, Long wrote, "Hoppe's argument, if it worked, would commit us to recognizing and respecting libertarian rights regardless of what our goals are – but as a praxeologist, I have trouble seeing how any practical requirement can be justified apart from a means-end structure."<ref name="Long Hoppriori">{{cite web|last=Long|first=Roderick T.|title=The Hoppriori Argument|url=http://praxeology.net/unblog05-04.htm#10|access-date=26 August 2013}}</ref> Long reconstructed Hoppe's argument in [[Validity (logic)|deductively valid]] form, specifying four premises on whose truth the argument's soundness depends, and showed that each premise is either uncertain, doubtful, or clearly false. Long summarized his views by stating: {{quote|I don't think there's any reason to reject out of hand the kind of argument that Hoppe tries to give; on the contrary, the idea that there might be some deep connection between libertarian rights and the requirements of rational discourse is one I find attractive and eminently plausible. [...] But I am not convinced that the specific argument Hoppe gives us is successful.<ref name="Long Hoppriori"/>}}

Libertarian philosopher [[Jason Brennan]] rejected Hoppe's argument, saying: {{quote|For the sake of argument, on Hoppe's behalf, grant that by saying "I propose such and such," I take myself to have certain rights over myself. I take myself to have some sort of right to say, "I propose such and such." I also take you to have some sort of right to control over your own mind and body, to control what you believe. (Nota bene: I don't think Hoppe can even get this far, but I'm granting him this for the sake of argument.) All I need to avoid a performative contradiction is for me to have a liberty right to say, "I propose such and such." I need not presuppose I have a claim right to say "I propose such and such." Instead, at most, I presuppose that it's permissible for me to say, "I propose such and such." I also at most presuppose that you have a liberty right to believe what I say. I do not need to presuppose that you have a claim right to believe what I say. However, libertarian self-ownership theory consists of claim rights [...] Hoppe's argument illicitly conflates a [[Claim rights and liberty rights|liberty right with a claim right]], and so fails.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Brennan |url=https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2013/12/hoppes-argumentation-ethics-argument-refuted-in-under-60-seconds/ |title=Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics Argument Refuted in Under 60 Seconds |publisher=Bleeding Heart Libertarians |date=2013-12-12 |access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref>}}

Another critic argued that Hoppe had not provided any non-circular reasons why we "have to regard moral values as something that ''must'' be regarded as being established through (consensual) argument instead of 'mere' subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways". In other words, the theory relies "on the existence [of] certain intuitions, the acceptance of which cannot itself be the result of 'value-free' reasoning."<ref>J. Mikael Olsson, [http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:775605/FULLTEXT01.pdf ''Austrian Economics as Political Philosophy''], Stockholm Studies in Politics 161, p. 157, 161.</ref>

==Views on democracy==
{{Main|Democracy: The God That Failed}}
In 2001, Hoppe published ''[[Democracy: The God That Failed]]'' which examines various social and economic phenomena which, Hoppe argues, are problems caused by democratic forms of government. He attributes democracy's failures to pressure groups which seek to increase government expenditures and regulations. Hoppe proposes alternatives and remedies, including [[secession]], decentralization of government, and "complete freedom of contract, occupation, trade and migration".<ref>R.M. Pearce, [http://www.nationalobserver.net/2003_autumn_br5.htm Book Review: Democracy: the God That Failed], [[National Observer (Australia)]], No. 56, Autumn 2003.</ref> Hoppe argues that monarchy would preserve individual liberty more effectively than democracy.<ref name="gordondemocracy">[[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]], [https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=199 Review of Hans-Hermann Hoppe, ''Democracy: The God that Failed''], "The Mises Review" of [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], Volume 8, Number 1, Spring 2002; Volume 8, Number 1.</ref>

In 2013, Hoppe reflected on the relationship between democracy and the arts and concluded that "democracy leads to the subversion and ultimately disappearance of the notion of beauty and universal standards of beauty. Beauty is swamped and submerged by so-called '[[modern art]]'."<ref>Fonseca, Joel (1 August 2013). [http://www.mises.org.br/Article.aspx?id=1644 "The Brazilian Philosophy Magazine Dicta & Contradicta Interviews Hans-Hermann Hoppe"]. Mises Institute Brazil</ref>

[[Walter Block]], a colleague of Hoppe's at the [[Mises Institute]], asserts that Hoppe's arguments shed light "on historical occurrences, from wars to poverty to inflation to interest rates to crime". Block notes that while Hoppe concedes that 21st-century democracies are more prosperous than the monarchies of old, Hoppe argues that if nobles and kings replaced today's political leaders, their ability to take a long-term view of a country's well-being would "improve matters". Block also shared what he called minor criticisms of Hoppe's theses regarding [[time preference]]s, immigration and the gap between libertarianism and conservatism.<ref>[[Walter Block]], [https://ssrn.com/abstract=1946360 Review of ''Democracy: The God that Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order''], [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]], Vol. 61, No. 3, July 2002.</ref>

Alberto Benegas-Lynch Jr. criticized Hoppe's thesis that monarchy is preferable to democracy.<ref name=Reply2ABL>Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (1997). [http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/benegas.pdf "On Theory and History. Reply to Benegas-Lynch Jr."]. Published in Gerard Radnitzky, ed., ''Values and the Social Order'', Vol. 3 (Aldershot: Avebury, 1997).</ref>
A Professor of Economics at the [[University of Buenos Aires]],<ref>[http://www.cato.org/people/alberto-benegas-lynch "Alberto Benegas Lynch."] Cato.org</ref> Benegas-Lynch provided empirical evidence demonstrating that modern monarchies tend to be far poorer than modern democracies. In response, Hoppe argued that monarchies tend to be poorer than democracies not because of intrinsic features of these political systems, but because African countries, populated by what Hoppe considers to be racially inferior people, are disproportionately monarchical whereas European countries are mostly democratic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hoppe|first=Hans-Hermann|date=1997|title=On Theory and History. Reply to Benegas-Lynch Jr.|url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/benegas.pdf|journal=Values and the Social Order|volume=3|pages=1–8|via=HansHoppe.com}}</ref> Citing the book ''[[Race, Evolution, and Behavior]]'' by [[Scientific racism|racialist]] psychologist [[J. Phillipe Rushton]], Hoppe claimed that comparing African monarchies to European democracies would "lead to a systematic distortion of the evidence given that [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] have, on the average, a significantly lower degree of time preference than [[Negroid]]s".<ref name=Reply2ABL/>

===Expulsion of dissidents===
In ''Democracy'' Hoppe describes a fully libertarian society{{Secondary source needed|date=September 2016}} of "[[Covenant (law)#Exclusionary covenants|covenant communities]]" made up of residents who have signed an agreement defining the nature of that community. Hoppe writes "There would be little or no 'tolerance' and 'openmindedness' so dear to [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarians]]. Instead, one would be on the right path toward restoring the freedom of association and exclusion implied in the institution of [[private property]]". Hoppe writes that towns and villages could have warning signs saying "no beggars, bums, or homeless, but also no homosexuals, drug users, Jews, Muslims, Germans, or Zulus".<ref name=Hoppe211>Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (2001). ''Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy and Natural Order'', Transaction Publishers, p. 211. {{ISBN|1412815290}}</ref><ref>Block, Walter (2007). [http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/29/rp_29_10.pdf "Plumb-Line Libertarianism: A Critique of Hoppe"]. Reason Papers.</ref>

Hoppe also makes plain that he believes that practicing certain forms of discrimination, including the physical removal of homosexuals and political dissidents, is completely compatible with his system.

Hoppe writes:

{{quote|In a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists, . . . naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They – the advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centered lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism – will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order.<ref name="pp. 216–218">Hoppe, ''Democracy: The God That Failed'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qARC56X5vxcC&pg=PA216e pp. 216–218]</ref>}}

Commenting on this passage, Martin Snyder of the [[American Association of University Professors]] said Hoppe's words will disturb "[t]hose with a better memory than Hoppe for segregation, apartheid, internment facilities and concentration camps, for yellow stars and pink triangles".<ref name="Snyder"/> Hoppe also provoked controversy by calling homosexuality a "perversity or abnormality" analogous to pedophilia, drug use, pornography, polygamy and obscenity.<ref>{{cite book|first=Hans-Hermann|last=Hoppe|title=Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy and Natural Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qARC56X5vxcC&pg=PA206|page=206|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781412815291|quote=Did this not imply that vulgarity, obscenity, profanity, drug use, promiscuity, pornography, prostitution, homosexuality, polygamy, pediphilia or any other conceivable perversity or abnormality, insofar as they were victimless crimes, were no offenses at all but perfectly normal and legitimate activities and lifestyles?}}</ref>

[[Walter Block]] wrote that Hoppe's statement calling for the physical removal of homosexuals from a libertarian political community was "exceedingly difficult to reconcile with libertarianism." Block argues that "it is entirely possible that some areas of the country, parts of Gotham and San Francisco for example, will require this practice, and ban, entirely, heterosexuality. If this is done through contract, private property rights, restrictive covenants, it will be entirely compatible with the libertarian legal code."<ref>[[Walter Block]] ([[Loyola University New Orleans]]), [https://mises.org/journals/scholar/block15.pdf "Libertarianism is unique; it belongs neither to the right nor the left: a critique of the views of Long, Holcombe, and Baden on the left, Hoppe, Feser and Paul on the right"], undated, published at [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] website, pp. 22–23.</ref>

== Support for immigration restrictions and critiques ==
Although a self-proclaimed anarcho-capitalist who favors abolishing the nation-state, Hoppe believes that as long as states exist, they should impose some restrictions on immigration. Hoppe has equated free immigration to "forced integration" which violates the rights of native peoples, since if land were privately owned, immigration would not be unhindered but would only occur with the consent of private property owners.<ref name="migrations">Hans Hoppe, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe1.html On Free Immigration and Forced Integration], [[LewRockwell.com]], 1999.</ref>

Hoppe's Mises Institute colleague [[Walter Block]] has characterized Hoppe as an "anti-open immigration activist" who argues that, though all public property is "stolen" by the state from [[taxpayer]]s, "the state compounds the injustice when it allows immigrants to use [public] property, thus further "invading" the private property rights of the original owners".<ref name="mises2">Anthony Gregory and Walter Block On [https://mises.org/journals/jls/21_3/21_3_2.pdf Immigration: Reply to Hoppe], [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]], Volume 21, No. 3, Fall 2007, pp. 25–42.</ref> However, Block rejects Hoppe's views as incompatible with libertarianism. He argues that Hoppe's logic implies that flagrantly unlibertarian laws such as regulations on prostitution and drug use "could be defended on the basis that many tax-paying property owners would not want such behavior on their own private property".<ref name="BlockLaborEcon">{{cite book |last1=Block |first1=Walter |title=Labor Economics From A Free Market Perspective: Employing The Unemployable |page=225 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mXICgAAQBAJ&pg=PA225 |access-date=13 July 2018 |isbn=9789814475860 |date=28 March 2008 }}</ref> Another libertarian author, Simon Guenzl, writing for ''Libertarian Papers'' argues that: "supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with Rothbardian and Hoppean libertarian anarchism, as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state's role in society."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Guenzl|first=Simon|date=23 June 2016|title=Public Property and the Libertarian Immigration Debate|journal=Libertarian Papers|volume= 8|quote=I conclude that supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with Rothbardian and Hoppean libertarian anarchism, as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state's role in society.}}</ref>

In terms of specific immigration restrictions, Hoppe argued that an appropriate policy will require immigrants to the United States to display proficiency in English in addition to "superior (above-average) intellectual performance and character structure as well as a compatible system of values".<ref>Walter Block and Gene Callahan, [http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/block-callahan_right-immigrate-2003.pdf Is There a Right to Immigration?: A Libertarian Perspective], [[Human Rights Review]], October–December 2003.</ref> He suggested that these criteria would lead to a "systematic pro-European immigration bias". [[Jacob Hornberger]] of the ''Future of Freedom Foundation'' argued that the immigration test Hoppe advocated would probably be prejudiced against Latin American immigrants to the United States.<ref>Jacob Hornberger, [http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/lets-stick-traditional-american-values/ Let's Stick with Traditional American Values!], The Future of Freedom Foundation, 1 February 2000.</ref>

==Remarks about homosexuals and academic freedom==
Following a 4 March 2004, lecture on [[time preference]] at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV), a student complained that Hoppe created a hostile classroom environment by stating that  homosexuals tend to be more shortsighted than heterosexuals in their ability to save money and plan (economically) for the future, in part because they tend not to have children.<ref name="Snyder_a">{{Cite news | issn = 0190-2946 | volume = 91 | issue = 2 | pages = 127 | last = Snyder | first = Martin | title = Birds of a Feather? | work = Academe | quote=So what ignited the controversy in Nevada? In March 2004, a student formally accused Hoppe of creating a hostile classroom environment during a lecture on time preference, a notion in economics identifying individuals' varying degrees of willingness to defer the immediate consumption of goods in favor of saving and investment. Hoppe opined that certain demographic groups, for instance homosexuals, tend to be more shortsighted in their economic outlook than those who have children.}}</ref> Hoppe also suggested that [[John Maynard Keynes]]'s homosexuality might explain his economic views, with which Hoppe disagreed.<ref>{{Cite news | issn = 0190-2946 | volume = 91 | issue = 2 | pages = 127 | last = Snyder | first = Martin | title = Birds of a Feather? | work = Academe | quote=He also suggested that the economic theories of John Maynard Keynes might be explained by Keynes's reputed homosexuality.}}</ref> Hoppe also stated that very young and very old people, and couples without children, were less likely to plan for the future. Hoppe told a reporter that the comments lasted only 90 seconds of a 75-minute class, no students questioned the comments in that class, and that in 18 years of giving the same lecture all over the world, he had never previously received a complaint about it. At the request of university officials, Hoppe apologized to the class. He said, "Italians tend to eat more spaghetti than Germans, and Germans tend to eat more sauerkraut than Italians" and explained that he was speaking in generalities. Thereafter, Hoppe told the reporter, the student alleged that Hoppe did not take the complaint seriously and filed a formal complaint. Hoppe told the reporter that he felt as if it were he who was the victim in the incident and that the student should have been told to "grow up".<ref name=Lake>Richard Lake, {{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Feb-05-Sat-2005/news/25808494.html |title=UNLV accused of limiting free speech |access-date=15 May 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209040615/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Feb-05-Sat-2005/news/25808494.html |archive-date=9 February 2005 }} [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]], 5 February 2005.</ref>

An investigation was conducted and the university's provost, [[Raymond W. Alden III]], issued Hoppe a non-disciplinary letter of instruction on 9 February 2005, with a finding that he had "created a hostile or intimidating educational environment in violation of the University's policies regarding discrimination as to sexual orientation". Alden also instructed Hoppe to "... cease mischaracterizing opinion as objective fact", asserted that Hoppe's opinion was not supported by peer-reviewed academic literature, and remarked that Hoppe had "refus[ed] to substantiate [his] in-class statements of fact ..."<ref name="alden2005">{{cite web|last=Alden, III|first=Raymond W.|title=Findings and non-disciplinary letter of instruction|url=https://www.mises.org/pdf/hoppeletter.pdf|author-link=Raymond W.

Hoppe appealed the decision, saying the university had "blatantly violated its contractual obligations" toward him and described the action as "frivolous interference with my right to academic freedom".<ref>Justin Chomintra, ''[http://archive.mises.org/3137/the-thought-police-and-hoppe/ Professor, ACLU may sue UNLV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903112107/http://archive.mises.org/3137/the-thought-police-and-hoppe/ |date=3 September 2013 }}'', ''The Rebel Yell'', 10 February 2005; reprinted by [[Stephen Kinsella]] at Mises.org, 10 February 2005.</ref> He was represented by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].

But academic freedom means nothing if it doesn't protect the right of professors to present scholarly ideas that are relevant to their curricula, even if they are controversial and rub people the wrong way".<ref name=Lake/> Alden's decision was picked up by [[Fox News]] and several blogs and libertarians organized a campaign to contact the university.<ref name=LVSFeb8/> The university received two weeks of bad publicity and the Interim Chancellor ([[Nevada System of Higher Education]]) [[James E.

Jim Rogers intervened in the matter.

She decided that Hoppe's views, even if non-mainstream or controversial, should not be cause for reprimanding him. She dismissed the discrimination complaint against Hoppe and the non-disciplinary letter was withdrawn from Hoppe's personnel file.<ref name="Snyder">{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Martin D.|title=Birds of a Feather?|journal=Academe|date=1 March 2005|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-829841891|access-date=17 April 2013 |publisher=American Association of University Professors|doi=10.2307/40253419|jstor=40253419}}</ref> She wrote:

Various controversies about [[academic freedom]], including the Hoppe matter and remarks made by [[Harvard University]] President [[Lawrence Summers]], prompted the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to hold a conference on academic freedom in October 2005.<ref>The role of [[Tenure (academic)|academic tenure]] was included during the conference. {{cite news|title=Teachers' tenure on front burner|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/oct/13/teachers-tenure-on-front-burner/#axzz2UBIVranP|access-date=23 May 2013|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=13 October 2005}}</ref> In 2009 UNLV proposed a new policy that included the encouragement of reporting by people who felt that they had encountered bias.<ref name="Hsu">The proposed policy defined "bias incidents" as "'verbal, written, or physical acts of intimidation, coercion, interference, frivolous claims, discrimination, and sexual or other harassment motivated, in whole or in part, by bias" based on characteristics including actual or perceived race, religion, sex (including gender identity or gender expression or a pregnancy-related condition), physical appearance and political affiliation.' {{cite news|last=Hsu|first=Charlotte|title=ACLU airs free speech concerns on bias policy: Faculty express concern; UNLV official says proposal would encourage expression|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/apr/25/aclu-airs-free-speech-concerns-bias-policy/#axzz2UBIVranP|access-date=23 May 2013|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=25 April 2009 }}</ref> The proposed policy was criticized by the Nevada ACLU and some faculty members who remembered the Hoppe incident as adverse to academic freedom.<ref name="Hsu" /><ref>[http://media.lasvegassun.com/media/pdfs/blogs/documents/2009/04/24/unlv_bias_policy.pdf Policy on Bias Incidents and Hate Crimes (Final draft)], [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, Department of Police Services, Office of the Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion Policy on Bias Incidents and Hate Crimes.</ref>
