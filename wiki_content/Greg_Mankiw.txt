From 2003 to 2005, Mankiw was Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] under President [[George W. Bush]]. In 2006, he became an economic adviser to [[Mitt Romney]], and worked with Romney during his presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012. In October 2019, he announced that he was no longer a Republican because of his criticism of President [[Donald Trump]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name="Trump" />

After college, Mankiw spent a year working on his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and a subsequent year studying at [[Harvard Law School]]. He worked as a staff economist for the Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1983, which foreshadowing his later position as its chairman. After leaving the council, he earned his PhD in economics from MIT in 1984 under the supervision of [[Stanley Fischer]]. He returned to Harvard Law for a year, but having completed his PhD and realizing that he was better at economics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/06/jd-vs-phd-my-story.html|title=Greg Mankiw's Blog: JD vs PhD: My Story}}</ref> he left to teach at MIT for a year and then became an assistant professor of economics at [[Harvard University]] in 1985. He was promoted to full professor in 1987, at the age of 29.

==Academic writings==
Mankiw is widely considered as a [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian economist]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} although at least one financial journalist states that he resists such easy categorisation.<ref name='NoahSmith'>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Noah |date=13 January 2017 |title=Tribal warfare in economics a thing of the past |newspaper=The Australian Financial Review |publisher=Fairfax Media |agency=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |quote=[Joseph] Stiglitz is a hero to the left, while [Greg] Mankiw is a small-government conservative.}}</ref> Mankiw did important work on [[menu costs]], which are a source of [[price stickiness]]. His paper "Small Menu Costs and Large Business Cycles: A Macroeconomic Model of Monopoly," which was published in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' in 1985, compared a firm's private incentive to adjust prices because of a shock to nominal aggregate demand to that decision's the social welfare implications. The paper concluded that expansion in aggregate demand may either increase welfare or reduce it, but the welfare reduction is never greater than the menu cost. A contraction in aggregate demand, however, reduces welfare, possibly in an amount much larger than the menu cost. In other words, from a social planner's point of view, prices may be stuck too high but never too low.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policonomics.com/mankiw-menu-cost/|title=Mankiw's menu cost model - Policonomics|website=www.policonomics.com}}</ref> The paper was a building block for work by [[Olivier Blanchard]] and [[Nobuhiro Kiyotaki]]<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1814537|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=77|issue=4|pages=647–666|last1=Blanchard|first1=Olivier Jean|title=Monopolistic Competition and the Effects of Aggregate Demand|last2=Kiyotaki|first2=Nobuhiro|year=1987}}</ref> on aggregate-demand externalities and for work by [[Laurence M. Ball]] and David Romer<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2297377|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=57|issue=2|pages=183–203|last1=Ball|first1=Laurence|title=Real Rigidities and the Non-Neutrality of Money|last2=Romer|first2=David|year=1990|doi=10.2307/2297377|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w2476.pdf}}</ref> on the interaction between real and nominal rigidities.

In 2002, Mankiw and [[Ricardo Reis]] proposed an alternative to the widely-used New Keynesian [[Phillips curve]] that is based on the slow diffusion of information among the population of price setters. Their sticky-information model displays three related properties that are more consistent with accepted views about the effects of monetary policy. Firstly, disinflations are always contractionary although announced disinflations are less contractionary than surprise ones. Secondly, monetary policy shocks have their maximum impact on inflation with a substantial delay. Thirdly, the change in inflation is positively correlated with the level of economic activity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sticky Information versus Sticky Prices: A Proposal to Replace the New Keynesian Phillips Curve|first1=N. Gregory|last1=Mankiw|first2=Ricardo|last2=Reis|date=1 November 2002|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=117|issue=4|pages=1295–1328|doi=10.1162/003355302320935034|s2cid=1146949|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3415324/Mankiw_StickyInformationVersus.pdf}}</ref>

A related 2003 article by Mankiw, Reis, and [[Justin Wolfers]] analyzed data on inflation expectations and documented substantial disagreement among both consumers and professional economists about expected future inflation. That disagreement is shown to vary over time and to move with inflation, the absolute value of the change in inflation, and relative price variability. The paper argues that a satisfactory model of economic dynamics must address those business-cycle moments. Noting that most macroeconomic models do not endogenously generate disagreement, they show that a sticky-information model broadly matches many of those facts. The model is also consistent with other observed departures of inflation expectations from full rationality, including autocorrelated forecast errors and insufficient sensitivity to recent macroeconomic news.<ref>https://www.nber.org/chapters/c11444.pdf</ref>

Mankiw has also written several papers on the empirical analysis of consumer behavior and often emphasizes the role of heterogeneity. An article coauthored with John Campbell in 1989 found that the aggregate consumption data are best described by a model in which about half of consumers obey the [[permanent income hypothesis]], and half simply consume their current income, which is sometimes called hand-to-mouth behavior.<ref>https://www.nber.org/chapters/c10965.pdf</ref> An article coauthored with Stephen Zeldes in 1991 found the consumption of stockholders to covary more strongly with the stock market than the consumption of nonstockholders did. That provided a possible explanation for the [[equity premium puzzle]].<ref>{{cite journal |first1=N. Gregory |last1=Mankiw |first2=Stephen P. |last2=Zeldes |title=The consumption of stockholders and nonstockholders |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=97–112 |doi=10.1016/0304-405X(91)90015-C |citeseerx=10.1.1.364.2730 |s2cid=3084416}}</ref>

Mankiw's most widely-cited paper is "A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth," which was coauthored with [[David Romer]] and David Weil and published in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' in 1992. The paper argues that the [[Solow-Swan model|Solow growth model]], once augmented to include a role for human capital, explains reasonably well international differences in standards of living. According to [[Google Scholar]], it has been cited more than 15,000 times, which makes it one of the most cited articles in the field of economics.

Beyond his work in macroeconomics, Mankiw has also written several other notable papers. In 1989, he coauthored a paper with David Weil that examined the demographic determinants of housing demand and predicted that the aging of [[baby boomers]] would undermine the housing market in the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mankiw | first = N.

It is ambiguous whether free entry produces too many or too few firms because of offsetting business-stealing and product-variety externalities.<ref>http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/klemperer/IO_Files/free%20entry%20%20Mankiw%20and%20Whinston.pdf</ref>

==Textbooks==
Mankiw has written two popular college-level textbooks: the intermediate-level ''Macroeconomics'' (now in its 10th edition, published by [[Worth Publishers]]) and the more famous introductory text ''[[Principles of Economics (Mankiw)|Principles of Economics]]'' (now in its 9th edition, published by [[Cengage]]). Subsets of chapters from the latter book are sold under the titles ''Principles of Microeconomics'', ''Principles of Macroeconomics'', ''Brief Principles of Macroeconomics'', and ''Essentials of Economics''. The book was signed for a record advance. ''The New York Times'' reported in 1995 that Mankiw "was offered a $1.4 million advance by Harcourt Brace in Fort Worth to write a basic economics textbook. "That's about three times as big as any other in the college textbook market and rivals those of all but a few celebrity authors."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/14/business/a-hard-act-to-follow-here-goes.html|title=A Hard Act to Follow? Here Goes.|first=Sylvia|last=Nasar|date=14 March 1995|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

When the first edition of the ''Principles'' book was published in 1997, ''The Economist'' magazine stated,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/node/154859|title=Play it again, Samuelson|newspaper=The Economist|date=1997-08-21}}</ref>

{{quote|Mr. Mankiw has produced something long overdue: an accessible introduction to modern economics. By writing more in the style of a magazine than a stodgy textbook and explaining even complex ideas in an intuitive, concise way, he will leave few students bored or bewildered.... Most refreshing, though, is the book's even-handedness. Mr Mankiw seems to revel in setting out how different schools of thought have contributed to economists' current state of knowledge.}}

Since then, more than one million copies have been sold, and Mankiw has received an estimated $42 million in royalties from the book, which is priced at $280 per copy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A $280 college textbook busts budgets, but Harvard author Gregory Mankiw defends royalties|url = http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2015/02/a_280_college_textbook_busts_b.html|website = OregonLive.com|access-date = 2015-12-17|date = February 12, 2015|last = Read|first = Richard}}</ref>

==Other career activities==
In May 2003, President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Mankiw as Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]]. Mankiw served in that post from 2003 to 2005 and was followed by [[Harvey S. Rosen]] and then [[Ben Bernanke]]. As chairman, Mankiw was part of a [[George W. Bush administration]] effort seeking greater oversight of two [[government-sponsored enterprise|government-sponsored enterprises]]: [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]]. In a November 2003 speech to a conference of bank supervisors,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/cea/text/gsemankiw_speech_nov_6_2003.html|via=[[NARA|National Archives]]|work=[[whitehouse.gov]]|title=Remarks at the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (Text Only)}}</ref> he said:

{{quote|The enormous size of the mortgage-backed securities market means that any problems at the GSEs matter for the financial system as a whole. This risk is a systemic issue also because the debt obligations of the housing GSEs are widely held by other financial institutions. The importance of GSE debt in the portfolios of other financial entities means that even a small mistake in GSE risk management could have ripple effects throughout the financial system.}}

The proposed regulatory reforms were passed into law only years later, when the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] was well underway.

After leaving the CEA, Mankiw resumed teaching at Harvard and took over one of the most popular classes at [[Harvard College]], the introductory economics course Ec 10, from [[Martin Feldstein]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Harvard Course Catalog|url=https://coursecatalog.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=CourseCatalog&panel=icb.pagecontent695860%3Arsearch%3Ffq_school_nm%3Dschool_nm%253A%2522Faculty%2Bof%2BArts%2Band%2BSciences%2522%26q%3D%2522economics%2B10%2522%26rows%3D25%26sort%3Dcourse_title%2Basc%26start%3D0&pageid=icb.page335057&pageContentId=icb.pagecontent695860&view=detail&viewParam_q=id:d_colgsas_2012_4_3660_&viewParam_returnUrl=search%3Ffq_school_nm%3Dschool_nm%253A%2522Faculty%2Bof%2BArts%2Band%2BSciences%2522%26q%3D%2522economics%252010%2522%26sort%3Dcourse_title%2520asc%26start%3D0%26rows%3D25#a_icb_pagecontent695860|access-date=18 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529181242/https://coursecatalog.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=CourseCatalog#a_icb_pagecontent695860|archive-date=29 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He has become an influential figure in the [[blogosphere]] and online journalism since launching his eponymous [[blog]].

===2004 Economic Report of the President===
Several controversies arose from CEA's February 2004 Economic Report of the President. In a press conference, Mankiw spoke of the gains from free trade and noted that [[outsourcing]] of jobs by US companies is "probably a plus for the economy in the long run."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/12/bush.outsourcing | work=CNN | title=Bush adviser backs off pro-outsourcing comment | date=February 11, 2004 | access-date=May 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2770517/Mankiw_PoliticsEconomics.pdf</ref> Thar reflected mainstream economic analysis but was criticized by many politicians,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bush-econ-advisor-outsourcing-ok/|title=Bush Econ Advisor: Outsourcing OK|website=www.cbsnews.com}}</ref><ref name="Man1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/12/bush.outsourcing/|title=CNN.com - Bush adviser backs off pro-outsourcing comment - Feb. 12, 2004|website=www.cnn.com}}</ref> who drew a link between outsourcing and the slow recovery of the US labor market in early 2004.<ref name="Man1"/>

Controversy also arose from a rhetorical question posed by the report and repeated by Mankiw in a speech about the report:<ref>[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/cea/economic_report-20040217.html Remarks on the 2004 Economic Report of the President to the National Economists Club and Society of Government Economists<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604100247/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/cea/economic_report-20040217.html |date=2010-06-}}</ref> "when a fast-food restaurant sells a hamburger, is it providing a service or combining inputs to manufacture a product?" He intended to point out that the distinction between manufacturing jobs and service industry jobs is somewhat arbitrary and so is a poor basis for policy. Even though the issue was not raised in the report, a news account led to criticism that the administration was seeking to cover up job losses in manufacturing by redefining jobs like cooking hamburgers as manufacturing.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02EFDC113DF933A15751C0A9629C8B63 "In the New Economics: Fast-Food Factories?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 20, 2004.

===2011 student walkout===
On November 2, 2011, a number of students in Mankiw's Economics 10 class walked out of his lecture. Several dozen of the 750 students participated.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2011/11/07/occupy_harvard_students_walk_out_on_greg_mankiw_economics_class_.html| first=Will| last=Oremus | title=Harvard Students Stage Walkout in OWS-Like Protest | newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=November 8, 2011 | quote=where some 70 students walked out of an introductory economics class last week to protest what they saw as biased teachings. | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218031230/http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2011/11/07/occupy_harvard_students_walk_out_on_greg_mankiw_economics_class_.html |archive-date=December 18, 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://money.cnn.com/2011/11/02/news/economy/mankiw_harvard_ows/ |first=Chris| last=Isidore |title=O.W.S. stages walk-out of Harvard econ class | work=[[CNN]] | date=November 2, 2011 | quote=Jose DelReal, a reporter with The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, said about 60 students participated in the walk-out.}}</ref> Before leaving, they handed Mankiw an open letter critical of his course that stated in part:
{{quote|we found a course that espouses a specific—and limited—view of economics that we believe perpetuates problematic and inefficient systems of economic inequality in our society today.... Economics 10 makes it difficult for subsequent economics courses to teach effectively as it offers only one heavily skewed perspective rather than a solid grounding on which other courses can expand.... Harvard graduates play major roles in the financial institutions and in shaping public policy around the world. If Harvard fails to equip its students with a broad and critical understanding of economics, their actions are likely to harm the [[global financial system]]. The last five years of economic turmoil have been proof enough of this.<ref>[http://hpronline.org/harvard/an-open-letter-to-greg-mankiw/ "An Open Letter to Greg Mankiw"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102063356/http://hpronline.org/harvard/an-open-letter-to-greg-mankiw/ |date=2013-01-02}}, 'Harvard Political Review'', November 2, 2011</ref>}}

The students concluded their letter by stating that they would instead be attending the underway [[Occupy Boston]] demonstration. Counterprotesters showed up in that class, and Mankiw replied to his students in an article in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/business/know-what-youre-protesting-economic-view.html | work=The New York Times | first=N. Gregory | last=Mankiw | title=Know What You're Protesting – Economic View | date=December 3, 2011}}</ref> An editorial in the student-run ''[[The Harvard Crimson|Harvard Crimson]]'' condemned the protest<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/3/ec-walkout-occupy/|title=Stay in School - Opinion - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com}}</ref> by
stating:

{{quote|The truth is that Ec 10, a requirement for economics concentrators, provides a necessary academic grounding for the study of economics as a social science. Professor Mankiw's curriculum sticks to the basics of economic theory without straying into partisan debate. We struggle to believe that we must defend his textbook, much maligned by the protesters, which is both peer reviewed and widely used.... Supply-and-demand economics is a popular idea of how society is organized, and Mankiw's Ec 10 never presents itself as more than that.}}

===2016 opposition to Donald Trump===
{{main|Stop Trump movement}}
In August 2016, Mankiw expressed opposition to the election of [[Donald Trump]] to the presidency.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/11/mankiw-no-vote-trump |title= Mankiw, Renowned Conservative, Will Not Vote Trump }} The Harvard Crimson.</ref> On his blog, he wrote:<ref>{{cite web|url= https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2016/08/my-take-on-mr-trump.html |title= My Take on Mr. Trump }} Greg Mankiw’s Blog.</ref>
{{quote|Mr. Trump has not laid out a coherent economic worldview, but one recurrent theme is hostility to a free and open system of international trade. From my perspective as an economics policy wonk, that by itself is disqualifying. And then there are issues of temperament.... he does not show the admirable disposition that I saw in previous presidents and presidential candidates I have had the honor to work for.}}

===2019 departure from Republican Party===
On October 28, 2019, Mankiw left the Republican Party and registered as an independent by citing his disappointment in the party's overlooking of President Trump's misdeeds and a wish to vote in either primary in his home state, Massachusetts.<ref name="Trump">{{cite web|url= https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2019/10/i-am-no-long-republican.html |title= I am no longer a Republican}} Greg Mankiw’s Blog.</ref>

The group also included [[James A. Baker III]], [[Martin S. Feldstein]], [[Henry M. Paulson Jr.]], and [[George P. Shultz]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheConservativeCaseforCarbonDividends.pdf|title = Climate Leadership Council &#124; the Bipartisan Climate Solution}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/science/a-conservative-climate-solution-republican-group-calls-for-carbon-tax.html|title='A Conservative Climate Solution': Republican Group Calls for Carbon Tax|first=John|last=Schwartz|date=7 February 2017|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>
