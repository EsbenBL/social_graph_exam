==Work==
Bentley held that interactions of groups are the basis of political life, and rejected statist abstractions. In his opinion, group activity determined legislation, administration and adjudication. These ideas of process-based behavioralism later became central to political science. His tenet that "social movements are brought about by group interaction" is a basic feature of contemporary [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] and interest-group approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arthur F.

His work ''The Process of Government'', published in 1908, had much influence on political science from the 1930s to the 1950s. Although initially not of consequence, it influenced other groups such as the [[Chicago School (sociology)|Chicago School]] who also tried to develop objective, value-free analyses of the political field. This influence is still felt decades on (1983 : Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Grenoble, Mémoire "Décision Groupale et Réalité Démocratique dans The Process of Government", P. Chabal).<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Process of Government — Arthur F. Bentley, Peter H.

His paper "The Human Skin: Philosophy's Last Line of Defense" (1941) was published in ''Philosophy of Science'' 8 (1941): 1-19.
