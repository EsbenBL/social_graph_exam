===Education===
Bell was graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]]. He received a bachelor's degree from the [[City College of New York]] in 1938, and completed graduate work at [[Columbia University]] during the 1938–1939 academic year.<ref name="bio2">Durham Peters, John, and Simonson, Peter (eds.)

===Career===
Bell began his professional life as a journalist, being managing editor of ''[[The New Leader]]'' magazine (1941–1945), labor editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' (1948–1958), and later, co-editor (with his college friend [[Irving Kristol]]) of ''[[The Public Interest]]'' magazine (1965–1973).

During the 1950s, it was close to the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]].<ref name=GuarObit /> Subsequently, he taught sociology, first at Columbia (1959–1969) and then at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] until his retirement in 1990.<ref name="bio1">Jumonville, Neil, ed.

Bell also was the visiting [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]] at [[Cambridge University]] in 1987. He served as a member of the President's Commission on Technology in 1964–1965 and as a member of the President's Commission on a National Agenda for the 1980s in 1979.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l92JAgAAQBAJ&q=Daniel+Bell+member+of+the+President%27s+Commission+on+Technology+in+1964%E2%80%931965+and+as+a+member+of+the+President%27s+Commission+on+a+National+Agenda+for+the+1980s+in+1979.&pg=PA149|title=Daniel Bell|last=Waters|first=Malcolm|date=2002-01-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134845569|pages=149|language=en}}</ref>

Bell served on the board of advisors for the ''[[Antioch Review]]'', and published some of his most acclaimed essays in the magazine: "Crime as an American Way of Life" (1953), "Socialism: The Dream and the Reality" (1952), "Japanese Notebook" (1958), "Ethics and Evil: Frameworks for Twenty-First Century Culture" (2005), and "The Reconstruction of Liberal Education: A Foundational Syllabus" (2011).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antiochcollege.edu/news/archive/daniel-bell-noted-sociologist-and-advisor-antioch-review-dies|title=Daniel Bell, Noted Sociologist and Advisor to the Antioch Review, Dies &#124; Antioch College|website=www.antiochcollege.edu}}</ref>

Bell once described himself as a "socialist in economics, a liberal in politics, and a conservative in culture."<ref name="quote">Gardner, Martin.

==Scholarship==
Bell is best known for his contributions to [[post-industrialism]]. His most influential books are, ''[[The End of Ideology]]'' (1960), ''The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism'' (1976),<ref name="contratimesreview">Williams, Raymond.

===''The End of Ideology''===
In ''[[The End of Ideology]]'' (1960), Bell suggests that the older grand humanistic ideologies, derived from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are exhausted and that new more parochial ideologies will soon arise. With the rise of affluent welfare states and institutionalized bargaining between different groups, Bell maintains, revolutionary movements which aims to overthrow liberal democracy will no longer be able to attract the working classes.<ref>Strand, Daniel. [http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A974844&dswid=-7623 No Alternatives: The End of Ideology in the 1950s and the Post-political World of the 1990s], pp. 140–145 (Stockholm University 2016) ({{ISBN|978-91-7649-483-7}})</ref>

===''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''===
In ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting'' (1973), Bell outlined a new kind of society, the [[post-industrial society]]. He argued that post-industrialism would be [[information]]-led and [[Service (economics)|service]]-oriented. Bell also argued that the post-industrial society would replace the industrial society as the dominant system.

There are three components to a post-industrial society, according to Bell:
* a shift from manufacturing to services,
* the centrality of the new science-based industries,
* the rise of new technical elites and the advent of a new principle of stratification.

Bell also conceptually differentiates between three aspects of the post-industrial society: data, or information describing the empirical world; information, or the organization of that data into meaningful systems and patterns such as statistical analysis; and knowledge, which Bell conceptualizes as the use of information to make judgments. Bell discussed the manuscript of ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'' with [[Talcott Parsons]] before its publication.

===''The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism''===
In ''The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism'' (1976), Bell contends that the developments of twentieth-century capitalism have led to a contradiction between the cultural sphere of consumerist instant self-gratification and the demand, in the economic sphere, for hard-working, productive individuals.<ref name="cult1">[[Eric Liu|Liu, Eric]]. [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/09/how-boomers-left-us-with-an-ethical-deficit/63478/ How Boomers Left Us With an Ethical Deficit], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', September 24, 2010 ("When Daniel Bell wrote of the cultural contradictions of capitalism – that a self-denying work ethic leads to the affluence that gives rise to self-gratifying play ethic that ends up corroding the affluence – he could also have described the life cycle of the Boomers.")</ref> Bell articulates this through his "three realms" methodology, which divides modern society into the cultural, economic, and political spheres.

Bell's concern is that, with the growth of the welfare state throughout the post-war years, more and more of the population demand that the state fulfil the hedonistic desires which the cultural sphere encourages. That dovetails with the ongoing requirement for the state to maintain the kind of strong economic environment conducive to continual growth. For Bell, the competing, contradictory demands place excessive strain on the state that was manifest in the economic turbulence, fiscal pressure, and political upheaval characteristic of the 1970s.<ref name=gilbert_culture-crunch>{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Andrew|title=The culture crunch: Daniel Bell's The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism|journal=[[Thesis Eleven]]|date=October 2013|volume=118|pages=83–95|doi=10.1177/0725513613500383|s2cid=143463159|url=http://the.sagepub.com/content/118/1/83.abstract}}</ref>
