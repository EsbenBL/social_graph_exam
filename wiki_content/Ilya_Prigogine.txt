Because the family was critical of the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet system]], they left Russia in 1921. They first went to [[Germany]] and in 1929, to [[Belgium]], where Prigogine received Belgian nationality in 1949. His brother [[Alexandre Prigogine|Alexandre]] (1913–1991) became an ornithologist.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Alexandre Prigogine (1913–1991)|pages=89–90|author=Louette, Michel|journal=Ibis|volume=134|year=1992|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb07238.x|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Prigogine studied [[chemistry]] at the [[Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)|Free University of Brussels]], where in 1950, he became professor. In 1959, he was appointed director of the [[Solvay Conference|International Solvay Institute]] in Brussels, Belgium. In that year, he also started teaching at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in the [[United States]], where he later was appointed Regental Professor and Ashbel Smith Professor of Physics and Chemical Engineering. From 1961 until 1966 he was affiliated with the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and was a visiting professor at [[Northwestern University]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Todd May|title=Emerging Trends in Continental Philosophy|date=11 September 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317546788|page=114}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Northwestern Nobels: Northwestern Magazine - Northwestern University|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/spring2017/feature/stoddart_sidebar/northwestern-nobels|access-date=2021-01-05|website=www.northwestern.edu}}</ref> In Austin, in 1967, he co-founded the Center for Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, now the [[Center for Complex Quantum Systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2003/05/28/nr_prigogine/|title=Nobel Prize-winning physical chemist dies in Brussels at age 86|publisher=Utexas.edu|date=28 May 2003|access-date=19 December 2012}}</ref> In that year, he also returned to Belgium, where he became director of the Center for Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics.

He was a member of numerous scientific organizations, and received numerous awards, prizes and 53 honorary degrees. In 1955, Ilya Prigogine was awarded the [[Francqui Prize]] for Exact Sciences. For his study in [[irreversibility|irreversible]] [[thermodynamics]], he received the [[Rumford Medal]] in 1976, and in 1977, the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]]. In 1989, he was awarded the title of [[Viscount]] in the [[Belgian nobility]] by the [[King of the Belgians]]. Until his death, he was president of the [[International Academy of Science, Munich]] and was in 1997, one of the founders of the International Commission on Distance Education (CODE), a worldwide accreditation agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ias-icsd.org/history.html|title=History – International Academy of Science, Munich|website=www.ias-icsd.org|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ias-icsd.org/resources/ICSD-IAS-Presidium.pdf International Council for Scientific Development.

Prigogine was first married to Belgian poet Hélène Jofé (as an author also known as Hélène Prigogine) and in 1945 they had a son Yves. After their divorce, he married Polish-born [[chemist]] Maria Prokopowicz (also known as Maria Prigogine) in 1961. In 1970 they had a son, Pascal.<ref>Ilya Prigogine. (2003).

==Research==
Prigogine is best known for his definition of [[dissipative structures]] and their role in [[thermodynamic system]]s far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], a discovery that won him the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1977. In summary, Ilya Prigogine discovered that importation and dissipation of energy into chemical systems could result in the emergence of new structures (hence dissipative structures) due to internal self reorganization.<ref>{{cite journal|author=P. T. Macklem|title=Emergent phenomena and the secrets of life|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=3 April 2008|volume=104|issue=6|pages=1844–1846|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00942.2007|pmid=18202170}}</ref> In his 1955 text, Prigogine drew connections between dissipative structures and the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh-Bénard instability]] and the [[Turing pattern|Turing mechanism]].<ref>I. Prigogine, ''Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes'', Charles C. Thomas Publisher, Springfield, Illinois, 1955</ref>

===Dissipative structures theory===
Dissipative structure theory led to pioneering research in [[self-organizing system]]s, as well as philosophical inquiries into the formation of complexity on biological entities and the quest for a creative and irreversible role of time in the [[natural science]]s.

With professor [[Robert Herman]], he also developed the basis of the [[two fluid model]], a traffic model in [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]] for urban networks, analogous to the two fluid model in classical statistical mechanics.

Prigogine's formal concept of [[self-organization]] was used also as a "complementary bridge" between [[General Systems Theory]] and [[thermodynamics]], conciliating the cloudiness of some important systems theory concepts{{which|date=December 2013}} with scientific rigor.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Work on unsolved problems in physics===
{{see also|Unsolved problems in physics}}
In his later years, his work concentrated on the fundamental role of [[indeterminism]] in [[nonlinear dynamics|nonlinear systems]] on both the [[classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] level. Prigogine and coworkers proposed a [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville space]] extension of quantum mechanics. A Liouville space is the [[vector space]] formed by the set of (self-adjoint) [[linear operator]]s, equipped with an inner product, that act on a [[Hilbert space]].<ref>Gregg Jaeger: ''Quantum Information: An Overview'', Springer, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-387-35725-6}}, Chapter B.3 "Lioville space and open quantum systems", [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0ho97k7S4oC&pg=PA248 p. 248]</ref> There exists a mapping of each linear operator into Liouville space, yet not every self-adjoint operator of Liouville space has a counterpart in Hilbert space, and in this sense Liouville space has a richer structure than Hilbert space.<ref>T. Sida, K. Saitô, Si Si (eds.): ''Quantum Information and Complexity: Proceedings of the Meijo Winter School, 6–10 January 2003'', World Scientific Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|978-981-256-047-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BQ1MPLxzR4AC&pg=PA62 p. 62]</ref> The Liouville space extension proposal by Prigogine and co-workers aimed to solve the [[Entropy (arrow of time)#Current research|arrow of time problem]] of thermodynamics and the [[measurement problem]] of quantum mechanics.<ref>{{cite journal|author=T.

Prigogine co-authored several books with [[Isabelle Stengers]], including ''The End of Certainty'' and ''La Nouvelle Alliance'' (''Order out of Chaos'').

===''The End of Certainty''===
In his 1996 book, ''La Fin des certitudes'', written in collaboration with [[Isabelle Stengers]] and published in English in 1997 as ''The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos, and the New Laws of Nature'', Prigogine contends that determinism is no longer a viable scientific belief: "The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism." This is a major departure from the approach of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], all of whom expressed their theories in terms of deterministic equations. According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of [[irreversibility]] and [[instability]].

Prigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles.{{sfnp|Prigogine|Stengers|1997|p=19–20}} This led to the field of [[statistical mechanics]] and the realization that gases undergo [[irreversible process]]es. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the [[arrow of time]]. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the "present," which follows a determined "past" and precedes an undetermined "future." All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or as undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including [[diffusion]], [[radioactive decay]], [[solar radiation]], [[weather]] and the emergence and evolution of [[life]]. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of [[probability]].

Prigogine asserts that [[Newtonian physics]] has now been "extended" three times:{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} first with the introduction of spacetime in [[general relativity]], then with the use of the wave function in [[quantum mechanics]], and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems ([[chaos theory]]).
