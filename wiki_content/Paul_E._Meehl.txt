==Biography==

===Childhood===
Paul Meehl was born January 3, 1920, in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to Otto and Blanche Swedal. His family name "Meehl" was his stepfather's.<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007"/> When he was age 16, his mother died as the result of poor medical care which, according to Meehl, greatly affected his faith in the expertise of medical practitioners and diagnostic accuracy of clinicians.<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007"/> After his mother's death, Meehl lived briefly with his stepfather, then with a neighborhood family for one year so he could finish high school. He then lived with his maternal grandparents, who lived near the [[University of Minnesota]].

===Education and academic career===
Meehl started as an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] at the University of Minnesota in March 1938.<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007"/> He earned his bachelor's degree in 1941<ref name="NYTimesObit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/19/us/paul-meehl-83-an-example-for-leaders-of-psychotherapy.html|title=Paul Meehl, 83, an Example For Leaders of Psychotherapy|last=Goode|first=Erica|date=19 February 2003|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=4 January 2017|location=New York, NY}}</ref> with [[Donald G. Paterson]] as his advisor, and took his [[PhD]] in [[psychology]] at [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]] under [[Starke R. Hathaway]] in 1945. Meehl's [[Postgraduate education|graduate student]] cohort at the time included [[Marian Breland Bailey]], [[William K. Estes]], [[Norman Guttman]], William Schofield, and [[Kenneth MacCorquodale]].<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007"/> Upon taking his doctorate, Meehl immediately accepted a faculty position at the university, which he held throughout his career. In addition, he had appointments in psychology, [[law]], [[psychiatry]], [[neurology]], [[philosophy]], and served as a fellow of the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science, founded by [[Herbert Feigl]], Meehl, and [[Wilfrid Sellars]].<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007"/>

Meehl rose quickly to academic positions of prominence. He was chairman of the University of Minnesota Psychology Department at age 31, president of the Midwestern Psychological Association at age 34, recipient of the [[American Psychological Association]]'s [[APA Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Psychology|Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Psychology]] at age 38, and president of that association at age 42. He was promoted to Regents' professor, the highest academic position at the University of Minnesota, in 1968. He received the Bruno Klopfer Distinguished Contributor Award in personality assessment in 1979, and was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1987.<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007">{{cite book|author=Paul E Meehl|editor=Lindzey G, Runyan WM|title=A History of Psychology in Autobiography|url=http://meehl.umn.edu/sites/g/files/pua1696/f/139autobiography.pdf|volume=8|year=2007|publisher=American Psychological Association|isbn=978-1-59147-796-9|pages=337–389}}</ref>

Meehl was not particularly religious during his upbringing,<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007" /> but in adulthood during the 1950s collaborated with a group of [[Lutheran]] theologians and psychologists to write ''What, Then, Is Man?''.<ref>{{cite book |title=What, Then, Is Man?: A Symposium of Theology, Psychology, and Psychiatry |last=Meehl |first=Paul E. |author-link=Paul E. Meehl |year=1958 |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |location=St. Louis (MO) }}</ref> This project was commissioned by the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] through [[Concordia Seminary]]. The project explored both [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] theology, psychological science, and how [[Christians]] (Lutherans, in particular) could responsibly function as both Christians and psychologists without betraying orthodoxy or sound science and practice.

=== Later life and death ===
In 1995, Meehl was a signatory of a collective statement titled ''[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]'', written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name="gottfredson">Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', p A18.</ref> He died on February 14, 2003, at his home in [[Minneapolis]] of [[chronic myelomonocytic leukemia]].<ref name="NYTimesObit" /> In 2005, [[Donald R. Peterson]], a student of Meehl's, published a volume of their correspondence.<ref name="peterson">Peterson, Donald R. (2005). ''Twelve Years of Correspondence With Paul Meehl: Tough Notes From a Gentle Genius.'' Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref>

==Philosophy of science==
Meehl founded, along with [[Herbert Feigl]] and [[Wilfrid Sellars]], the Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science, and was a leading figure in philosophy of science as applied to psychology.<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007"/> Early in his career Meehl was a proponent of [[Karl Popper]]'s [[Falsificationism]], and later amended his views as neo-Popperian.<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007"/>

Arguably Meehl's most important contributions to psychological research methodology were in legitimizing scientific claims about unobservable psychological processes. In the first half of the 20th century, psychology was dominated by operationism and [[behaviorism]]. As outlined in Bridgman's [[The Logic of Modern Physics]] if two researchers had different operational definitions, they had different concepts.  There was no "surplus meaning".  If, for example, two researchers had different measures of "Anomia" or "Intelligence", they had different concepts. Behaviorists focussed on Stimulus-Response laws and were deeply skeptical of "unscientific" explanations in terms of unobservable psychological processes. Behaviorists and operationists would have rejected as unscientific any notion that there was some general thing called "intelligence" that existed inside a person's head and that might be reflected almost-equivalently in Stanford-Binet I.Q. tests or Weschler tests. Meehl changed that via two landmark papers.

MacCorquodale and Meehl introduced the distinction between "hypothetical construct" and "intervening variable".<ref>MacCorquodale, Kenneth, and Paul E. Meehl. "On a distinction between hypothetical constructs and intervening variables." Psychological review 55, no. 2 (1948): 95.</ref> "Naively, it would seem that there is a difference in logical status between constructs which involve the hypothesization of an entity, process, or event which is not itself observed, and constructs which do not involve such hypothesization." (pp.&nbsp;95–96) An intervening variable is simply a mathematical combination of operations. If one speaks of the "expected value" of a gamble—Probability of winning x Payoff for winning—this is not hypothesizing any unobservable psychological process. Expected value is simply a mathematical combination of observables.  On the other hand, if one attempts to make statements about "attractiveness" of a gamble, if this is not observable or perfectly captured by some single operational measure, this is a "hypothetical construct"—a theoretical term that is not itself observable or a direct function of observables.  They used as examples Hull's rg (anticipatory goal response, discussed on p.&nbsp;100) or Allport's "biophysical traits", or Murray's "needs". "These constructs involve terms which are not wholly reducible to empirical terms; they refer to processes or entities that are not directly observed (although they need not be in principle unobservable)." Such constructs had "surplus meaning".  Thus, good behaviorists and operationists should be comfortable with statements about intervening variables, but should have greater wariness of hypothetical constructs.

[[Lee J. Cronbach]] and Meehl legitimized theory tests about unobservable, hypothetical constructs.<ref name="CronbachMeehl1955">{{cite journal|last1=Cronbach|first1=Lee J.|last2=Meehl|first2=Paul E.|title=Construct validity in psychological tests.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=52|issue=4|year=1955|pages=281–302|issn=0033-2909|doi=10.1037/h0040957|pmid=13245896|hdl=11299/184279|hdl-access=free}}</ref>  Constructs are unobservables, and they can be stable traits of individuals (e.g., "Need for Cognition") or temporary states (e.g., nonconscious goal activation). Previously, good behaviorists had deep skepticism about the legitimacy of psychological research about unobservable processes.  Cronbach and Meehl introduced the concept of "construct" validity for cases in which there was no "gold standard" criterion for validating a test of a hypothetical construct. Hence, any construct had "surplus meaning". Construct validity was distinguished from predictive validity, concurrent validity, and content validity.  They also introduced the concept of the "nomological net" – the network of associations among constructs and measures. Cronbach and Meehl argued that the meaning of a hypothetical construct is given by its relations to other variables in a nomological network.  One tests a theory of relations among hypothetical constructs by showing that putative measures of these constructs relate to each other as implied by one's theory, as captured in the [[nomological network]]. This set the stage for modern [[Psychological testing|psychological test]] and set the stage for the cognitive revolution in psychology that focusses on the study of mental processes that are not directly observable.

Meehl was a strident critic of using statistical [[null hypothesis]] testing for the evaluation of scientific theory. He believed that null hypothesis testing was partly responsible for the lack of progress in many of the "[[Hard and soft science|scientifically soft]]" areas of [[psychology]] (e.g. [[clinical psychology|clinical]], [[counseling psychology|counseling]], [[social psychology|social]], [[personality psychology|personality]], and [[community psychology|community]]).<ref name="Meehl1978">{{cite journal|last1=Meehl|first1=Paul E.|title=Theoretical risks and tabular asterisks: Sir Karl, Sir Ronald, and the slow progress of soft psychology.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=46|issue=4|year=1978|pages=806–834|issn=0022-006X|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.46.4.806}}</ref>

"Meehl's paradox" is that in the hard sciences more sophisticated and precise methods make it harder to claim support for one's theory. The opposite is true in soft sciences like the social sciences. Hard sciences like physics make exact point predictions and work by testing whether observed data falsify those predictions. With increased precision, one is better able to detect small deviations from the model's predictions and harder to claim support for the model. In contrast, softer social sciences make only directional predictions, not point predictions. Softer social sciences claim support when the direction of the observed effect matches predictions, rejecting only the null hypothesis of zero effect. Meehl argued that no treatment in the real world has zero effect. With sufficient sample size, therefore, one should almost always be able to reject the null hypothesis of zero effect. Researchers who guessed randomly at the sign of any small effect would have a 50-50 chance of finding confirmation with sufficiently large sample size.<ref>P. E. Meehl. Theory-testing in psychology and physics: A methodological paradox.  Philosophy of science, 34(2):103–115, 1967.</ref>

==Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory==
Meehl was considered an authority on the development of [[Psychological testing|psychological assessments]] using the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI).<ref name="NYTimesObit" /><ref name=":2" /> While Meehl did not directly develop the original MMPI items (he was a high school junior when [[Starke R. Hathaway|Hathaway]] and [[J. C. McKinley|McKinley]] created the item pool), he contributed widely to the literature on interpreting patterns of responses to MMPI questions.<ref name="LindzeyRunyan2007"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cui-bono/201402/paul-e-meehl-smartest-psychologist-the-20th-century|title=Paul E. Meehl: Smartest Psychologist of the 20th Century?|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2018-02-14}}</ref>  In particular, Meehl argued that the MMPI could be used to understand [[personality]] profiles systematically associated with [[Clinical endpoint|clinical outcomes]], something he termed a [[Clinical psychology#Clinical v. mechanical prediction|statistical (versus a "clinical")]] approach to predicting behavior.<ref name="HathawayMeehl1951">{{cite book|author1=Starke Rosecrans Hathaway|author2=Paul Everett Meehl|title=An atlas for the clinical use of the MMPI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_VrAAAAMAAJ|year=1951|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816600700}}</ref><ref name="Meehl1956">{{cite journal|last1=Meehl|first1=Paul E.|title=Wanted--a good cook-book.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=11|issue=6|year=1956|pages=263–272|issn=0003-066X|doi=10.1037/h0044164}}</ref>

=== Interactions and suppressors: The K scale ===
As part of his doctoral [[dissertation]], Meehl worked with Hathaway to develop the K scale indicator of [[Validity scale|valid responding]] for the MMPI.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Meehl|first1=P. E.|last2=Hathaway|first2=S. R.|date=1946|title=The K factor as a suppressor variable in the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=30|issue=5|pages=525–564|doi=10.1037/h0053634|pmid=20282179|issn=1939-1854}}</ref> During initial clinical testing of the MMPI, a subset of individuals exhibiting clear signs of [[mental illness]] still produced normal personality profiles on the various clinical scales.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|title=MMPI-2 : assessing personality and psychopathology|last=Graham.|first=John R. |isbn=9780195378924|oclc=683593538|date = 2011-11-17}}</ref> It was suspected that these individuals were demonstrating clinical [[defense mechanisms|defensiveness]] and presenting as asymptomatic and well-adjusted. Meehl and Hathaway employed a technique called "empirical criterion keying" to compare the responses of these defensive individuals with other individuals who were not suspected of experiencing mental illness and who also produced normal MMPI profiles. The empirical criterion keying approach selected items based on their ability to maximally discriminate between these groups. They were not selected based on theory or [[face validity]] of the item content. As a result, items on the resulting scale, termed the K (for "correction") scale would be difficult to avoid for individuals attempting to present as well-adjusted when taking the MMPI. Individuals who endorsed the K scale items were thought to be demonstrating a sophisticated attempt to conceal information about their mental health history from test administrators. The K scale is an early example of a putative [[Mediation (statistics)#other third variables|suppressor variable]].

The K scale is used as a complement validity indicator to the L (for "lie") scale, whose items were selected based on item content [[face validity]] and are more obviously focused on impression management. The K scale has been popular among clinical psychologists, and has been a useful tool for MMPI and MMPI-2 profile interpretation.<ref name=":8" /> Meehl and Hathaway continued to conduct research using MMPI validity indicators and noticed K scales elevations were associated with greater denial of symptoms on some clinical scales more than others.<ref name=":7" /> To compensate for this, they developed a K scale correction factor aimed at offsetting effects of defensive responding on other scales measuring psychopathology. Substantial subsequent research conducted on the original MMPI clinical scales used these "K-corrected" scores, although research on the usefulness of the corrections has produced mixed results.<ref name=":8" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Louis M.|date=1986|title=Implications of differences in elevations of K-corrected and non-K-corrected MMPI T scores.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=54|issue=4|pages=552–557|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.54.4.552|pmid=3745611|issn=1939-2117}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McCrae|first1=R R|last2=Costa|first2=P T|last3=Dahlstrom|first3=W G|last4=Barefoot|first4=J C|last5=Siegler|first5=I C|last6=Williams|first6=R B|date=1989|title=A caution on the use of the MMPI K-correction in research on psychosomatic medicine.|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=51|issue=1|pages=58–65|doi=10.1097/00006842-198901000-00006|pmid=2928461|issn=0033-3174|citeseerx=10.1.1.551.6918|s2cid=985409}}</ref> The most recent iteration of the K scale, developed for the MMPI-2-RF, is still used for psychological assessments in clinical, neuropsychological, and forensic contexts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Interpreting the MMPI-2-RF|last=S.|first=Ben-Porath, Yossef|date=2012|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|oclc=940737881}}</ref>

==Clinical versus statistical prediction==

=== Meehl's proposal ===
Meehl's 1954 book ''Clinical vs. Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence'' analyzed the claim that mechanical (i.e., formal, [[algorithm]]ic, [[actuarial]]) methods of data combination would outperform clinical (i.e., subjective, informal) methods to predict behavior.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Meehl|first=Paul E.|date=1954|title=Clinical versus statistical prediction: A theoretical analysis and a review of the evidence.|doi=10.1037/11281-000}}</ref> Meehl argued that mechanical methods of prediction, when used correctly, make more efficient and reliable decisions about patient [[prognosis]] and treatment. His conclusions were controversial and have long conflicted with the prevailing consensus about psychiatric decision-making.<ref name=":1" />

Historically, mental health professionals commonly make decisions based on their professional clinical judgment (i.e., combining clinical information "in their head" and arriving at a prediction about a patient).<ref name="VriezeGrove2009">{{cite journal|last1=Vrieze|first1=Scott I.|last2=Grove|first2=William M.|title=Survey on the use of clinical and mechanical prediction methods in clinical psychology.|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=40|issue=5|year=2009|pages=525–531|issn=1939-1323|doi=10.1037/a0014693}}</ref> Meehl theorized that clinicians would make more mistakes than a mechanical prediction tool created to combine clinical data and arrive at predictions.<ref name=":3" /> Within his view, mechanical prediction approaches need not exclude any type of data from being combined and could incorporate coded clinical impressions. Once the clinical information is quantified, Meehl proposed mechanical approaches would make 100% [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]] predictions for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, would not provide this guarantee.<ref name="Meehl2013">{{cite book|author=Paul Meehl|title=Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Echo Point Books & Media|isbn=978-0-9638784-9-6}}</ref>

=== Later research comparing clinical versus mechanical prediction ===
[[Meta-analyses]] comparing clinical and mechanical prediction efficiency have supported Meehl's (1954) conclusion that mechanical methods outperform clinical methods.<ref name="grove">{{cite journal | last1 = Grove | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Zald | first2 = D.H. | last3 = Hallberg | first3 = A.M. | last4 = Lebow | first4 = B. | last5 = Snitz | first5 = E. | last6 = Nelson | first6 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Clinical versus mechanical prediction: A meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Assessment | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 19–30 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.12.1.19| pmid = 10752360 }}</ref><ref name="White2006">{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=M. J.|title=The Meta-Analysis of Clinical Judgment Project: Fifty-Six Years of Accumulated Research on Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction Stefania Aegisdottir|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|volume=34|issue=3|year=2006|pages=341–382|issn=0011-0000|doi=10.1177/0011000005285875|s2cid=145150890}}</ref> In response to objections, Meehl continued to defend algorithmic prediction throughout his career and proposed that clinicians should rarely deviate from mechanically-derived conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meehl | first1 = P.E. | year = 1957 | title = When Shall We Use Our Heads Instead of the Formula | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 268–273| doi = 10.1037/h0047554 | hdl = 11299/184612 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> To illustrate this, Meehl described a "broken leg" scenario in which mechanical prediction indicated that an individual has a 90% chance of attending the movies. However, the "clinician" is aware that the individual recently broke his leg, and this was not factored into the mechanical prediction. Therefore, the clinician can confidently conclude the mechanical prediction will be incorrect. The broken leg is objective evidence determined with high accuracy and highly correlated with staying home from the movies. Meehl argued, however, that mental health professionals rarely have access to such clear countervailing information as a broken leg, and therefore rarely if ever can appropriately disregard valid mechanical predictions.

Meehl argued that humans introduce biases when making decisions during clinical practice.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | last1 = Meehl | first1 = P.E. | year = 1986 | title = Causes and Effects of My Disturbing Little Book | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 370–375| doi = 10.1207/s15327752jpa5003_6 | pmid = 3806342 }}</ref><ref name="Dawes">{{cite journal | last1 = Dawes | first1 = R.M. | last2 = Faust | first2 = D. | last3 = Meehl | first3 = P.E. | year = 1989 | title = Clinical versus Actuarial Prediction | journal = Science | volume = 243 | issue = 4899| pages = 1668–1674 | doi=10.1126/science.2648573| pmid = 2648573 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.459.7990 }}</ref> For example, clinicians may seek out information to support their presuppositions, or miss and ignore information challenging their views. Additionally, Meehl described how clinical judgment could be influenced by overconfidence or anecdotal observations unsupported by empirical research. In contrast, mechanical prediction tools can be configured to use important clinical information and are not influenced by psychological biases. In support of this conclusion, Meehl and his colleagues found that clinicians still make less accurate decisions than mechanical formulas even when given the same mechanical formulas to help with their decision-making.<ref name="Dawes"/> Human biases have become central to research in diverse fields including [[behavioral economics]] and [[decision-making]].

==Schizophrenia==
Meehl was elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1962. In his address to the annual convention, he presented his comprehensive theory about the genetic [[causes of schizophrenia]].<ref name="Meehl1962">{{cite journal|last1=Meehl|first1=Paul E.|year=1962|title=Schizotaxia, schizotypy, schizophrenia.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=17|issue=12|pages=827–838|doi=10.1037/h0041029|issn=0003-066X|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.2509}}</ref> This conflicted with the prevailing notion that schizophrenia was primarily the result of a person's childhood rearing environment.<ref name="NYTimesObit" /> Meehl argued schizophrenia should be considered a genetically-based neurological disorder manifesting via complex interactions with personal and environmental factors. His reasoning was shaped by the writings of psychoanalyst [[Sandor Rado]] as well as the behavioral genetics findings at the time. He proposed that existing [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] theory about schizophrenia could be meaningfully integrated into his neurobiological framework for the disorder.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meehl|first=Paul E.|date=March 1972|title=Specific Genetic Etiology, Psychodynamics, and Therapeutic Nihilism|journal=International Journal of Mental Health|volume=1|issue=1–2|pages=10–27|doi=10.1080/00207411.1972.11448562|issn=0020-7411}}</ref>

=== Dominant schizogene theory ===
Meehl hypothesized the existence of an [[autosomal dominant]] "schizogene" widespread throughout the population, which would function as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for schizophrenia.<ref name="Meehl1962" /><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Meehl|first=Paul E.|date=1989-10-01|title=Schizotaxia Revisited|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=46|issue=10|pages=935–44|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1989.01810100077015|issn=0003-990X|pmid=2552952}}</ref> The schizogene would manifest on the cellular level throughout the [[central nervous system]] and should be observed as a functional control aberration called "hypokrisia". Cells exhibiting hypokrisia should contribute to a characteristic pattern of impaired integrative signal processing across multiple neural circuits in the brain, which Meehl termed "schizotaxia". In response to typical rearing environments and social reinforcement schedules, this neural aberration should invariably lead to a collection of observable behavioral tendencies called "[[schizotypy]]". Schizotypy indicators would include neurological soft signs, subtle differences in language usage ("[[cognitive slippage]]"), and effects on personality and emotion. Meehl believed many people in society exhibit signs of schizotypy as a result of the schizogene without showing signs of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia would only occur when individuals are carrying other non-specific genetic risk factors ("[[Polygene|polygenic]] potentiators") relevant for traits such as [[anhedonia]], ambivalence, and social fear. These additional traits would be more likely expressed under stress (e.g., trauma) and inconsistent social schedules from parents. Given these combinations of conditions, decompensation from schizotypy to schizophrenia would result.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Taxometrics==
With the help of several colleagues, Meehl developed multiple statistical methods for identifying the presence of categorical groupings within biological or psychological variables.<ref name="NYTimesObit" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://meehl.umn.edu/taxometrics-using-coherent-cut-kinetics|title=Taxometrics using Coherent Cut Kinetics {{!}} Paul E. Meehl|website=meehl.umn.edu|access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref> Meehl was a critic of the checklist ("polythetic") structure used to categorize mental illnesses in diagnostic manuals such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]].<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last=Meehl|first=Paul E.|date=1995|title=Bootstraps taxometrics: Solving the classification problem in psychopathology.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=50|issue=4|pages=266–275|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.50.4.266|pmid=7733538|issn=1935-990X}}</ref> Although many DSM-defined psychiatric syndromes can be reliability identified in clinical settings, Meehl argued that the categorical nature of mental illnesses assumed by these diagnoses (i.e., a person is either sick or well) should be tested empirically rather than accepted at face value. Meehl advocated for a data-driven approach that could, in the words of [[Plato]], "carve nature at its joints", and determine when it is most appropriate to conceptualize something as being categorical or continuous/dimensional.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

In his writings, Meehl advocated for the creation of a field called "taxometrics" to test for categorical groupings across diverse scientific disciplines.<ref name=":9" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meehl|first=Paul E.|date=2004|title=What's in a Taxon?|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=113|issue=1|pages=39–43|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.113.1.39|pmid=14992655|issn=1939-1846}}</ref> Based on this approach, latent "taxons" would be conceptualized as causal factors leading to true differences in kind within a population. Taxons could include many types of biological and psychosocial phenomena such as expression of an autosomal dominant gene (e.g., [[Huntington's disease]]), [[Sex|biological sex]], or indoctrination into a highly homogenous religious sect. Meehl envisioned applying taxometric approaches when the precise underlying latent causes are currently unknown and only observable "indicators" are available (e.g., psychiatric conditions). By mathematically examining patterns across these manifested indicators, Meehl proposed that converging evidence could be used to assess the plausibility of a true latent taxon while also estimating the base rate of that taxon.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== Coherent Cut Kinetics and L-Mode ===
Coherent Cut Kinetics is the suite of statistical tools developed by Meehl and his colleagues to perform taxometric analysis.<ref name=":10">{{Cite book|title=Multivariate taxometric procedures : distinguishing types from continua|last1=Waller|first1=Niels G.|last2=Meehl|first2=Paul E.|date=1998|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0761902570|oclc=37666366}}</ref> "Cut Kinetics" refers to the mathematical operation of moving potential cut points across distributions of indicator variables to create subsamples using dichotomous splits. Then, several metrics can be applied to assess if the candidate cut points can be explained by a latent taxon. "Coherent" refers to the process of using multiple indicators and metrics together to make a case for convergence about the categorical or dimensional nature of the phenomenon being studied.

=== "Why I Do Not Attend Case Conferences"<!-- [[Fallacy#See also]] links here: do not rename without fixing incoming link --> ===
In 1973, Paul Meehl published the [[polemic]] "Why I Do Not Attend Case Conferences".<ref name="Meehl1973">Meehl, P.E. (1973). ''Psychodiagnosis: Selected papers.'' Minneapolis (MN): University of Minnesota Press, p. 225-302.</ref>  He discussed his avoidance of [[Morbidity and mortality conference|case conferences]] in mental health clinics, where individual patients, or "cases", are discussed at length by a team, often as a training exercise. Meehl found such case conferences boring and lacking intellectual rigor. In contrast, he recalled numerous interesting illuminating case conferences within [[internal medicine]] or [[neurology]] departments, which often centered around [[pathologist]] reports and objective data about patients' [[pathophysiology]]. In other words, case conferences outside mental health disciplines were benefiting from including objective evidence against which clinical expertise could be compared and contrasted. Meehl argued for creating a psychiatric analogue to the pathologist's report. Additionally, he outlined a proposed format for case conferences beginning with initial discussion of clinical observations, and ending with a revealing of a subset of patient data (e.g., psychological testing results) to compare with attendees' clinical inferences and proposed diagnoses.

Meehl also elaborated upon the issue of clinical versus statistical prediction and the known weakness of unstructured clinical decision-making during typical case conferences. He encouraged clinicians to be humble when collaborating about patient care and pushed for a higher scientific standard for clinical reasoning in mental health treatment settings.<ref name="Meehl1973" /> Meehl directly identified several common deficiencies in reasoning that he had observed among his clinical colleagues, and to which he applied memorable names:

* ''[[Barnum effect]]'': Making a statement that is trivial and true of nearly all patients, but which is made as though it is important for the current patient.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Paul Meehl reader : essays on the practice of scientific psychology|last=1920-2003.|first=Meehl, Paul E. (Paul Everett)|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|others=Waller, Niels G.|isbn=978-1134812141|location=Mahwah, N.J.|oclc=853240687}}</ref>
* ''Sick-sick ("pathological set")'': The tendency to generalize from personal experiences of health and ways of being, to the identification of others who are different from ourselves as being "sick".{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}
* ''Me too'': The opposite of Sick-sick. Imagining that "everyone does this" and thereby minimizing a symptom without assessing the probability of whether a mentally healthy person would actually do it. A variation of this is ''Uncle George's pancake fallacy''. This minimizes a symptom through reference to a friend/relative who exhibited a similar symptom, thereby implying that it is normal.<ref name="NYTimesObit" />
* ''Multiple Napoleons fallacy'': "It's not real to us, but it's 'real' to him". "So what if he thinks he's Napoleon?" There is a distinction between reality and delusion that is important to make when assessing a patient and so the consideration of comparative realities can mislead and distract from the importance of a patient's delusion to a diagnostic decision.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/the-perils-of-hindsight-judgment/|title=The perils of hindsight judgment|last=Konnikova|first=Maria|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref> "If I think the moon is made of green cheese and you think it's a piece of rock, one of us must be wrong". For this, pointing out that the deviated cognitions of a delusional patient "seem real to him" is a waste of time. So, the statement "It is reality to him", which is philosophically either trivial or false, is also clinically misleading.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychodiagnosis : selected papers|last=1920-2003.|first=Meehl, Paul E. (Paul Everett)|date=1973|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0816606856|location=Minneapolis|oclc=234368210}}</ref>
* ''Hidden decisions'': Decisions based on factors that we do not own up to or challenge. An example is the placement of middle- and upper-class patients in therapy while lower-class patients are given medication. Meehl identified these decisions as related to an implicit ideal patient who is young, attractive, verbal, intelligent, and successful ([[YAVIS]]). He argued that YAVIS patients are preferred by psychotherapists because they can pay for long-term treatment and are more enjoyable to interact with.<ref name="Meehl1973"/>
* ''The spun-glass theory of the mind'': The belief that the human organism is so fragile that minor negative events, such as criticism, rejection, or failure, are bound to cause major trauma—essentially not giving humans, and sometimes patients, enough credit for their resilience and ability to recover.
* ''Crummy criterion fallacy'': This fallacy refers to how psychologists explain away the technical aspects of tests, using inappropriate and 'crummy' criterion that is observational instead of scientific, rather than incorporating the [[psychometric]] aspects into the interview, history, and other material being presented at case conferences.
* ''Understanding it makes it normal'': The act of normalizing or excusing a behavior just because one understands the cause or function of it, regardless of its normalcy or appropriateness. 
* ''Assumptions that content and dynamics explain why this person is abnormal'': Those who seek psychological services have characteristics associated with being a patient/care-seeker, but also characteristics of being human. Meehl argues that it is problematic to view a patient's normative life dysfunction to their psychopathology. For example, no individual is maximally effective in all aspects of their life. This will be true of non-patients and patients alike, and must be distinguished by the clinician from those aspects of the patient's life which are pathological and dysfunctional.
* ''Identifying the softhearted with the softheaded'': The belief that those who have sincere concern for the suffering (the softhearted) are the same as those who tend to be wrong in logical and empirical decisions (softheaded). 
* ''[[Ad hoc hypothesis|Ad hoc fallacy]]'': Creating explanations after we have been presented with evidence that is consistent with what has now been proven.
* ''Doing it the hard way'': Going about a task in a more difficult manner when an equivalent easier option exists; for example,  in clinical psychology, using an unnecessary instrument or procedure that can be difficult and time-consuming while the same information can be ascertained through interviewing or interacting with the client.
* ''Social scientists' anti-biology bias'': Meehl argued that social scientists like psychologists, sociologists, and psychiatrists have a tendency to react negatively to biological contributors to abnormal behavior, and therefore tending to be anti-drug, anti-genetic, and anti-[[electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]].
* ''Double standard of evidential morals'': When one is making an argument and requires less evidence for him or herself than does so for another.
