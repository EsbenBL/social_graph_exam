'''Sir William Arthur Lewis''' (January 23, 1915 – June 15, 1991) was a [[Saint Lucia]]n  [[economist]] and the James Madison Professor of Political Economy at [[Princeton University]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Legacy of Nobel laureate Sir W.

In 1979, he was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].

==Biography==
Arthur Lewis was born in [[Saint Lucia]], then still part of the [[British Windward Islands]] federal colony, the fourth of the five sons of George and Ida Lewis (the others being Stanley, Earl, [[Allen Montgomery Lewis|Allen]] and Victor).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/17/obituaries/sir-w-arthur-lewis-76-is-dead-winner-of-nobel-economics-prize.html#:~:text=Sir%20Arthur%20is%20survived%20by,Lucia.|title=Sir W.

Lewis's initial career choice was to become an engineer, "but this seemed pointless since neither the government nor the white firms would employ a black engineer," as he later said: "Eventually I decided to study business administration, planning to return to St. Lucia for a job in the municipal service or in private trade. I would simultaneously study law to fall back on if nothing administrative turned up."<ref name="Nobel biographical" /> At the age of 18, he earned the government scholarship to attend the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), becoming the first black individual to gain acceptance there. While enrolled to study for a Bachelor of Commerce degree ("which offered accounting, business management, commercial law and a little economics and statistics") in 1933,<ref name="Nobel biographical" /> he would achieve similar success as he did at grade school. Lewis's academic superiority was noticed and admired by his peers and professors. While at LSE, he had the opportunity to study under the likes of [[John Hicks]], [[Arnold Plant]], [[Lionel Robbins]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]].

After Lewis graduated in 1937 with first-class honours, LSE gave him a scholarship to read for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Industrial organization|industrial economics]],<ref name="Nobel biographical" /> under the supervision of Arnold Plant.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert L. |last=Tignor |title=W.

In 1947, Lewis married Gladys Jacobs, and they had two daughters together. That year he was selected as a lecturer at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], and moved there with his family, becoming Britain's first black lecturer. In 1948, at the age of 33, he was made a full professor.<ref name="Nobel biographical" /> He taught at Manchester until 1957.<ref name=Manchester>{{cite web|url=https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/economics/about/people/arthur-lewis/|title=Arthur Lewis|website=Economics|publisher=The University of Manchester|access-date=1 February 2021}}</ref> During this period, he developed some of his most important concepts about the patterns of capital and wages in developing countries. He particularly became known for his contributions to development economics, of great interest as former colonies began to gain independence from their European colonizers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Lewis served as an economic advisor to numerous African and Caribbean governments, including [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], Trinidad and Tobago, [[Jamaica]], and [[Barbados]]. When Ghana (where in 1929 his eldest brother Stanley had settled)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sta.uwi.edu/stan/archives/jul-sept2005.pdf|title=The Middle Passage – UWI receives George James Christian papers|website=St Augustine News|publisher=university of the West Indies|date=July–September 2005|page=18|access-date=1 February 2021}}</ref> gained independence in 1957, Lewis was appointed as the country's first economic advisor. He helped draw up its first Five-Year Development Plan (1959–1963).<ref>Felix Brenton, [http://www.blackpast.org/?q=gah/sir-william-arthur-lewis-1915-1991 "Sir (William) Arthur Lewis (1915–1991)"], Black Past website.</ref>

In 1959 Lewis returned to the Caribbean region when appointed [[Vice Chancellor]] of the [[University of the West Indies]]. In 1963 he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by the British government for his achievements and for his contributions to economics. That year, he was also appointed a [[University Professor]] at [[Princeton University]] – the first black instructor to be given a full professorship<ref name=Independent /> – and moved to the United States. Lewis worked at Princeton for the next two decades, teaching generations of students until his retirement in 1983. In 1970 Lewis was also selected as the first president of the [[Caribbean Development Bank]], serving in that capacity until 1973.<ref>[http://www.caribank.org/about-cdb/organisation/sir-arthur-lewis-past-president "Sir Wm.

Lewis received the [[Nobel prize]] in Economics in 1979, sharing it with [[Theodore Schultz]], "for their pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries".<ref name=nobel>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1979/ "The Sverige's Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1979"], Nobel in Economics, 1979.

Lewis died on 15 June 1991 in [[Bridgetown, Barbados|Bridgetown]], Barbados. He was buried in the grounds of the St. Lucian community college named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commonwealthwalkway.com/place/sir-arthur-lewis-burial-site/|title=Sir Arthur Lewis Burial Site|website=Commonwealth Walkway|access-date=1 February 2021}}</ref><!-- check below in the EL section for the archived college pages -->

==Key works==
===''Labour in the West Indies: The Birth of a Workers' Movement'' (1939)===
''Labour in the West Indies: The Birth of a Worker's Movement'', first published by the [[Fabian Society]] in 1939, was an account of the 1930s [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–1939|labour movement in the Caribbean]]. It remained the only work published on the Caribbean-wide movement and the Labour Rebellions in the English-speaking Caribbean for decades. The book was republished by [[John La Rose]] and Sarah White at [[New Beacon Books]] in February 1978.<ref>{{cite web |title=Labour in the West Indies – The Birth of a Workers' Movement (1977; original edition 1939) |url=https://www.georgepadmoreinstitute.org/the-pioneering-years/gallery-of-publications/labour-west-indies-%E2%80%93-birth-workers%E2%80%99-movement-1977 |publisher=[[George Padmore Institute]] |access-date=10 December 2020}}</ref> Lewis is now characterised as "among the earliest proponents of [[Reparations for slavery|Reparations]] for the former West Indies for Britain's colonial wrongs" because of the ideas he put forward in this work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caricomreparations.org/w-arthur-lewis-intellectual-author-of-caricoms-blueprint-for-reparatory-justice/|title=W.

===The "Lewis model"===
{{See also|Dual sector model|Lewis turning point}}
Lewis published in 1954 what was to be his most influential development economics article, "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour" (Manchester School).<ref>{{cite book |first=Diana |last=Hunt |chapter=W. A. Lewis on 'Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour' |title=Economic Theories of Development: An Analysis of Competing Paradigms |location=New York |publisher=Harvester Wheatsheaf |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7450-0237-8 |pages=87–95 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocO-QgAACAAJ&pg=PA87 }}</ref> In this publication, he introduced what came to be called the [[dual sector model]], or the "Lewis model".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gollin |first=Douglas |s2cid=153659972 |title=The Lewis Model: A 60-Year Retrospective |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=71–88 |jstor=23800576 |doi=10.1257/jep.28.3.71}}</ref>

Lewis combined an analysis of the historical experience of developed countries with the central ideas of the classical economists to produce a broad picture of the development process. In his theory, a "capitalist" sector develops by taking labour from a non-capitalist backward "subsistence" sector. The subsistence sector is governed by informal institutions and social norms so that producers do not maximize profits and workers can be paid above their marginal product. At an early stage of development, the "unlimited" supply of labour from the subsistence economy means that the capitalist sector can expand for some time without the need to raise wages.  This results in higher returns to capital, which are reinvested in capital accumulation. In turn, the increase in the capital stock leads the "capitalists" to expand employment by drawing further labour from the subsistence sector. Given the assumptions of the model (for example, that the profits are reinvested and that capital accumulation does not substitute for skilled labour in production), the process becomes self-sustaining and leads to modernization and economic development.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=W. Arthur |s2cid=154515303 |year=1954 |title=Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour |journal=[[The Manchester School (journal)|The Manchester School]] |volume=22 |issue= 2|pages=139–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1954.tb00021.x }}</ref><ref name=Leeson>{{cite journal |last1=Leeson |first1=P.

The point at which the excess labour in the subsistence sector is fully absorbed into the modern sector, and where further capital accumulation begins to increase wages, is sometimes called the [[Lewis Turning Point|Lewisian turning point]]. It has recently been widely discussed in the context of economic development in China.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&sid=aZGJ0mc_Dm5o |work=Bloomberg |title=China Reaches Turning Point as Inflation Overtakes Labor |date=11 June 2010}}</ref>

===''The Theory of Economic Growth'' (1955)===
In his 1955 book, ''The Theory of Economic Growth'', Lewis sought to "provide an appropriate framework for studying economic development", driven by a combination of "curiosity and of practical need."<ref name=Leeson/><ref>{{cite book|author=W. Arthur Lewis|title=Theory of Economic Growth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB7j96j6OmcC|date= 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-40708-3}}</ref>

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], England was experiencing the worst economic turmoil of its time. It would not be until an economic enlightenment took place that cities began to shift towards factories and labour-intensive methods of production as they experienced giant shifts in the labour and agriculture markets, thus, eventually leading to higher production, and higher income. Lewis theorized if England could turn its misfortune around, the same could be done for developing countries around the world. His theories proved true for some countries such as Nigeria and Barbados, as they would see some economic development.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}
