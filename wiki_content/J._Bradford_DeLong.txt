Along with [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Aaron Edlin]], DeLong is co-editor of ''[[The Economists' Voice]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bepress.com/ev |title=The Economists' Voice |publisher=Bepress.com |access-date=2014-04-28}}</ref> and has been co-editor of the  ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]''. He is also the author of a textbook, ''Macroeconomics'', the second edition of which he coauthored with [[Martha Olney]]. He co-edited (with [[Heather Boushey|Heather]] and Marshall Steinbaum) the book ''[[After Piketty|After Piketty: The Agenda for Economics and Inequality]]'' (2017), a volume of 22 essays about how to integrate inequality into economic thinking.

Bradford DeLong|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/j-bradford-delong|access-date=2021-03-21|website=Project Syndicate|language=en}}</ref>

In 1990 and 1991, DeLong and Lawrence Summers co-wrote two theoretical papers that were to become critical theoretical underpinnings for the financial deregulation put in place when Summers was Secretary of the Treasury under [[Bill Clinton]].

In 2019, DeLong said that he and other neoliberals had been “certainly wrong, 100 percent, on the politics” of economic policies. While he continued to believe that “good incremental policies” might be superior, he concluded that they were unattainable politically, because of the absence of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] willing to work toward such goals.  Instead, DeLong said, he favored "[[Single-payer healthcare|Medicare-for-all]], funded by a [[carbon tax]], with a whole bunch of [[Universal Basic Income]] rebates for the poor and public investment in green technologies."  He concluded, "The world appears to be more like what lefties thought it was than what I thought it was for the last 10 or 15 years."<ref name="Beauchamp">{{cite web
