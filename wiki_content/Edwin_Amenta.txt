'''Edwin Amenta''' is an American [[Sociology|sociologist]] best known for his study of [[social policy]], [[social movements]], and the [[New Deal]].

==Career==
Through his Political Mediation Theory, developed as a consequence of studying the Townsend movement for old-age [[pensions]] and other New Deal movements, Amenta has influenced how scholars conceptualize, study, and explain [[Social Movement Impact Theory|social movement impacts]].<ref>Halfmann, Drew. 2011. ''Doctors and Demonstrators: How Political Institutions Shape Abortion Law in the United States, Britain, and Canada.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref> He is also known for theorizing the role of [[political system|political institutions]] in [[policy]]-making. Amenta's recent work includes the development of a newspaper coverage database that allows scholars to test theories of social movement impacts across 34 major [[social movement organization]]s.<ref>[http://asj.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/08/0001699313518081.abstract Somma, Nicolas M.

Amenta has written three books and more than 50 articles and book chapters.

==Political Mediation Theory==
{{See also|Social Movement Impact Theory}}
Before Amenta, most work on movement impacts focused either on the internal characteristics of movements (membership, resources, organization, tactics) or their external environments (openness of the political system, elite alignments and alliances, and state repressive capacities). In his books ''Bold Relief'' and ''When Movements Matter'' and in a string of articles, Amenta’s political mediation model proffers theory regarding interactions between the internal characteristics of movements and their external environments. Amenta argues that particular movement tactics work better in some contexts than in others, and his empirical work shows interactions between the assertiveness of movement tactics and short-term political contexts. Specifically, when [[official|elected officials]] and state [[bureaucrat]]s are favorably disposed towards a movement, minimally-assertive tactics will suffice; but when elected officials and state bureaucrats are hostile towards a movement, assertive tactics are necessary. In addition, if elected officials are favorable but state bureaucrats are hostile, or vice versa, movement organizations must target the hostile parties rather than the favorable ones.<ref>Halfmann, Drew. 2011.
