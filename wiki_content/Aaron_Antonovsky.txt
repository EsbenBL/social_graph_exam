== Biography ==

Antonovsky was born in the United States in 1923. After completing his PhD at [[Yale University]], he emigrated to Israel in 1960. For a time he held positions in [[Jerusalem]] at the Israeli Institute for Applied Social Research and in the Department of [[Medical sociology|Medical Sociology]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. During this period his early work emphasized social class differences in morbidity and mortality.

In 1972, he helped establish the medical school at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], and held the Kunin-Lunenfeld Chair in Medical Sociology. During his twenty years in that Department, Antonovsky developed his theory of health and illness, which he termed [[salutogenesis]]. This model was described in his 1979 book, ''Health, Stress and Coping'', followed by his 1987 work, ''Unraveling the Mystery of Health''.

A key concept in Antonovsky's theory concerns how specific personal dispositions serve to make individuals more resilient to the stressors they encounter in daily life.<ref name="Lindström">Bengt Lindström and Monica Eriksson, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160910191056/http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/3/238.full.pdf "Contextualizing salutogenesis and Antonovsky in public health development"], ''Health Promotion International'', volume 21, pages 238-244, 2006.</ref> Antonovsky identified these characteristics, which he claimed helped a person better cope (and remain healthy) by providing that person a "sense of coherence"  about life and its challenges; Helen Antonovski (his wife) developed a scale ("Orientation to life questionnaire") in 1987 to measure it. Recent research in [[psychoneuroimmunology]] has supported the relationship between emotions and health contained in Antonovsky's theory. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  Antonovsky died in 1994.
