===Oprah Winfrey and the ''Dr. Phil'' show===
In 1995, [[Oprah Winfrey]] hired McGraw's legal consulting firm CSI to prepare her for the [[Food libel laws|Amarillo Texas beef trial]].

===Weight loss products (2003)===
In 2003, McGraw lent his name and image to a line of nutritional supplements, including vitamin packets, meal replacement drinks, and power bars under the brand name Shape Up, under a licensing agreement with CSA Nutraceuticals, a Texas start-up. The deal stipulated that a certain percentage of sales would be given to the Dr. Phil Foundation, a Dallas charity that works on issues like [[childhood obesity]].<ref name="day" />  Three disappointed consumers filed a lawsuit in 2004.

=== Copyright case (2017) ===
In September 2017, a judge issued a summary judgment on behalf of McGraw's production company, Peteski Productions. The case involved a former employee, Leah Rothman, who acquired a video and was planning to sell the video to the National Enquirer. In the ruling, US District Court Judge Rodney Gilstrap said that Rothman “did not copy to then educate the masses or to further the greater good,” but rather “She copied to aid her pending lawsuit seeking money damages where she is the only plaintiff and sole potential beneficiary.” The judge decided that Rothman could not use the argument that the video was “fair use” and therefore ruled against her.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Entertainment|first=Legal|title=Dr. Phil Wins Copyright Case Against Woman Who Accuses Him Of Imprisonment|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalentertainment/2017/09/01/dr-phil-wins-copyright-case-against-woman-who-accuses-him-of-imprisonment/|access-date=2020-07-06|website=Forbes|language=en|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806142117/https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalentertainment/2017/09/01/dr-phil-wins-copyright-case-against-woman-who-accuses-him-of-imprisonment/|url-status=live}}</ref>

McGraw's advice and methods have drawn criticism from some fellow psychotherapists as well as from some laypeople. McGraw's critics regard advice given by him to be at best simplistic and at worst ineffective.<ref>{{cite book|last= Salerno|first= Steve|title= SHAM; How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless|year= 2005|publisher= Crown Publishers|isbn= 978-1-4000-5409-1|url= https://archive.org/details/shamhowselfhelpm00sale}}</ref> The [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] called McGraw's conduct in one episode of his television show "unethical" and "incredibly irresponsible".<ref name="Moraes 2004">{{cite news |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=On Dr. Phil, a Dose of Bad Medicine? |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 1, 2004 |page=C7 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63905-2004Sep30.html |access-date=August 4, 2017 |archive-date=August 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804222148/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63905-2004Sep30.html |url-status=live }}</ref> McGraw said in a 2001 ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' interview that he never liked traditional one-on-one counseling, and that "I'm not the Hush-Puppies, pipe and 'Let's talk about your mother' kind of psychologist."<ref name=Lavin>Lavin, Cheryl.

McGraw frequently advises individuals to seek professional help, particularly [[psychotherapy]]. A 2016 study at [[Ohio State University]] found that viewers were more likely to seek professional mental health care for themselves and their children after seeing McGraw deal with similar issues on the ''Dr. Phil'' show.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Psych Advice You're Looking for in Psychology Today|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201404/the-psych-advice-youre-looking-in-psychology-today|access-date=2020-12-14|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}</ref> The study attributed this phenomenon to viewers tendency to form a parasocial bond with McGraw through watching the show, and have increased belief in their ability to seek help.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blakinger|first=Keri|date=2016-08-10|title='Dr. Phil' Viewers More Likely to Seek Mental Health Treatment, Study Shows|url=https://www.thefix.com/dr-phil-viewers-more-likely-seek-mental-health-treatment-study-shows|access-date=2020-12-14|website=The Fix|language=en}}</ref>
