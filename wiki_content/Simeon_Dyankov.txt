'''Simeon Dyankov''' ({{lang-bg|Симеон Дянков}}, also '''Djankov'''; born July 13, 1970) is a Bulgarian economist. From 2009 to 2013, he was the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Minister of Finance]] of Bulgaria in the government of [[Boyko Borisov]].{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Prior to his cabinet appointment, Dyankov was a chief economist of the finance and private sector vice-presidency of the [[World Bank]].

He was an associate editor of the ''[[Journal of Comparative Economics]]'' from 2004 to 2009. Dyankov was a chairman of the board of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].

At the World Bank, Dyankov was director of development economics. He was involved in the publication of [[World Development Report]]s and [[Ease of doing business index|Doing Business]] reports. The Doing Business reports were discontinued by the World Bank in 2021 after an independent inquiry documented how Dyankov, along with then World Bank CEO [[Kristalina Georgieva]], pressured staff to manipulate the results of Doing Business Reports, in particular making data for China and Saudi Arabia look better.

Since April 2020, Dyankov has been policy director at the Financial Markets Group at the [[London School of Economics]]. He has also been a senior fellow at the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]].

==Early life==
Dyankov was born in [[Lovech]], Bulgaria on July 13, 1970, Dyankov attended high school "Ekzarh Yosif I" in [[Lovech]] (1984–1989).

During his time at Harvard, Dyankov edited a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Comparative Economics]]'' on the 25th anniversary from the start of transition in Eastern Europe.

===Doing Business scandal===
Dyankov is the creator of the annual [[Doing Business report]], the top-selling publication of the World Bank Group. The report came out of joint research work with Professor [[Andrei Shleifer]] at [[Harvard University]], and was inspired by Dyankov's experience in overly-regulated socialist economies. In a 2016 article for the ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' Dyankov explains how Doing Business started.

The reports were discontinued by the World Bank in September 2021, following the release of an independent audit of the data irregularities. The audit documented how Dyankov, along with World Bank head Kristalina Georgieva, pressured staff to manipulate the results of Doing Business Reports, in particular making data for China and Saudi Arabia look better.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-17|title=IMF chief called out over pressure to favor China while at World Bank|url=https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/world-bank-kills-business-climate-report-after-ethics-probe-cites-undue-pressure-2021-09-16/|access-date=2021-09-19|website=Reuters|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=World Bank Group to Discontinue Doing Business Report|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2021/09/16/world-bank-group-to-discontinue-doing-business-report|access-date=2021-09-16|website=World Bank|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Zumbrun|first=Josh|date=2021-09-16|title=World Bank Cancels Flagship ‘Doing Business’ Report After Investigation|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-bank-cancels-flagship-doing-business-report-after-investigation-11631811663|access-date=2021-09-16|issn=0099-9660}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Machen|first=Ronald|last2=Jones|first2=Matthew|last3=Varghese|first3=George|last4=Stark|first4=Emily|date=15 September 2021|title=Investigation of Data Irregularities in Doing Business 2018 and Doing Business 2020|url=https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/84a922cc9273b7b120d49ad3b9e9d3f9-0090012021/original/DB-Investigation-Findings-and-Report-to-the-Board-of-Executive-Directors-September-15-2021.pdf|url-status=live|website=[[World Bank]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Fernholz|first=Tim|title=The World Bank scandal is a bad sign for the future of globalization|url=https://qz.com/2061781/world-banks-doing-business-scandal-is-bad-for-globalization/|access-date=2021-09-25|website=Quartz|language=en}}</ref>

==Political career==
Dyankov has been both Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Bulgaria.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

===Minister of Finance of Bulgaria===
On July 27, 2009, Dyankov became Minister of Finance of Bulgaria. He reduced budget spending and managed to cut the budget deficit for 2009 to 4.4%. In 2010 it met the Maastricht criteria – 3%, falling to 2% in 2011 and 0.45% in 2012.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2010/01/12/crime-crackdown-boosts-budget-crackdown-in-bulgaria/?KEYWORDS=simeon+djankov Crime Crackdown Boosts Budget Crackdown in Bulgaria] The Wall Street Journal January 12, 2010</ref> On December 1, 2009, [[Standard and Poors|Standard&Poors]] upgraded Bulgaria's investment outlook from "negative" to "stable," the only country in the [[European Union]] to receive an upgrade that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.novinite.com/articles/110627/Standard+%26+Poor%27s+Upgrades+Bulgaria%27s+Outlook+to+Stable|title=Standard & Poor's Upgrades Bulgaria's Outlook to Stable - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency|website=www.novinite.com}}</ref>

On numerous occasions, Minister Dyankov stated that two successive terms are needed to complete the reforms that would lead Bulgaria from poorest to middle-income country by Central European standards.<ref name="auto1">[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=111808 Bulgaria Ruling Party GERB Eyes Second Term, Clear Majority], January 10, 2010</ref> Soon after, Parliament adopted the so-called Golden Rules in the organic budget law: the government cannot surpass a deficit of 2% of GDP and a [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] of 40% in any given year. Dyankov was a member of the GERB cabinet, but not a party member.<ref name="auto">[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=115815 Bulgaria Finance Minister Rejects Presidential Bid Rumors], May 2, 2010</ref>

At the second GERB party congress Dyankov urged delegates to lead such policies that the party wins a second term with full majority in parliament. This is needed, he said, to complete the reforms that would lead Bulgaria from poorest to middle-income country by Central European standards.<ref name="auto1"/> Soon after, Parliament adopted the so-called Golden Rules in the organic budget law: the government cannot surpass a deficit of 2% of GDP and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 40% in any given year. Dyankov believes in his role as an expert rather than a politician and even though he is a member of the GERB cabinet, he is not a member of the GERB party.<ref name="auto"/>

In February 2013, Dyankov resigned in protest of the decision by Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]] to advance subsidies to farmers.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323495104578311883315898740?KEYWORDS=djankov Protests Pressure Bulgarian Government] The Wall Street Journal February 19, 2013</ref> On February 20, 2013, PM Borisov announced the resignation of the government due to increasing levels of violence in the protests due to high electricity prices.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323549204578315393360867474?KEYWORDS=borisov Bulgaria Government Quits] The Wall Street Journal February 20, 2013</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/world/europe/bulgarian-government-is-reported-set-to-resign.html?_r=0 After Bulgarian Protests, Prime Minister Resigns] ''[[The New York Times]]'' Feb 20, 2013</ref> Dyankov continued to serve as finance minister until a caretaker government was formed a month later.
