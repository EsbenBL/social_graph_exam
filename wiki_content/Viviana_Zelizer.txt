Viviana Zelizer was born in [[Argentina]], the daughter of S. Julio Rotman and Rosita Weill de Rotman.<ref name="highbeam.com">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150329162247/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3070300157.html Highbeam.com: "Biographies » Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series - Zelizer, Viviana A. 1946–"] January 1, 2008</ref> She attended University of Buenos Aires and studied law for two years.<ref name="Review: Economic Lives">{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Natalie|title=Review: Economic Lives: How Culture Shapes the Economy|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/414653.article|website=Times Higher Education|access-date=19 July 2014}}</ref> She emigrated to the United States in 1967<ref name="highbeam.com"/> when she married her husband, Rabbi [[Gerald L.

She went on to graduate school in sociology at [[Columbia University]] where she received an [[MPhil]] and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1974. In 1977, Zelizer received a [[Ph.D.]] in sociology.

Zelizer has identified four scholars at Columbia who influenced her intellectual career: [[Sigmund Diamond]], [[Bernard Barber]], [[David Rothman]], and [[Robert K. Merton]].<ref name="Economic Lives: How Culture Shapes the Economy">{{cite book|last1=Zelizer|first1=Viviana|title=Economic Lives: How Culture Shapes the Economy|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400836253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj4n550sBY4C|access-date=19 July 2014}}</ref> Diamond (whose PhD was in history) and Barber were her primary mentors in sociology, and Rothman in the history department. Zelizer has said that Merton was always present, but at a distance.

Zelizer's unique approach to sociology by way of social history was an initial burden, as she recounts:<blockquote>I remember all too painfully an early interview for a job in a university sociology department during which my interrogators asked pointedly how my social historical research qualified as sociology at all.<ref name="Economic Lives: How Culture Shapes the Economy" /></blockquote>

Zelizer joined the Department of Sociology at [[Rutgers University]] from 1976 to 1978. In 1976, she took an assistant professorship at Barnard College and Graduate Faculty of Columbia University, and advanced to full professor in 1985. She then joined the sociology faculty at Columbia University as a full professor, where she chaired the Department of Sociology from 1992 to 1996. She was named the Lloyd Cotsen '50 Professor of Sociology in 2002.<ref>[https://www.princeton.edu/~sociolog/headlines/combined_headlines.html Princeton.edu]</ref>

From 1987 to 1988 she was a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation, where she met another visiting scholar, sociologist [[Charles Tilly]]. At Princeton she interacted with influential colleagues [[Paul DiMaggio]] and [[Alejandro Portes]], as well as [[Michael Katz (sociologist)|Michael Katz]], then at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Economic Lives: How Culture Shapes the Economy" />

In 1996–1997, Zelizer was a [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow]] and a [[National Endowment for the Humanities Fellow]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].

In 2001, she was the elected the first chair of the newly created Economic Sociology section of the [[American Sociological Association]]. In 2003 the Economic Sociology section named its annual book prize the Viviana A. Zelizer Distinguished Book Award. In 2001 she was elected a member of the Council of the section on Comparative/Historical Sociology of the ASA.

Zelizer's son, [[Julian Zelizer]], joined Princeton's Department of History Public Affairs in 2007, becoming what is believed to be the first mother-son professorial team in Princeton's history.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rubin|first=Debra|title=Prof: Election dynamic bodes well for the Jews|publisher=[[New Jersey Jewish News]]|date=October 6, 2008|url=http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/101608/njProfElectionDynamic.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916150555/http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/101608/njProfElectionDynamic.html|archive-date=2013-09-16|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title= WEDDINGS;Nora K.
