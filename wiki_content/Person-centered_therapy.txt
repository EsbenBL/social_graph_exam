It is one of the most influential and fundamental modalities of treatment in modern psychological practice, and is applied almost universally in modern [[psychotherapy]]. Its radical non-directivity sets it apart from all other schools of therapy. 

==History and influences==
Person-centered Therapy was developed by [[Carl Rogers]] in the 1940s and 1950s, and brought to public awareness largely through his highly influential book ''Client-centred Therapy'', published in 1952. Its underlying theory arose from the results of empirical research, and it was the first theory of therapy to be research-driven,<ref>(Wilkins, p.27)</ref> with Rogers at pains to reassure other theorists that "the facts are always friendly".<ref>(Rogers, 1961, p.25)</ref>  Originally called non-directive therapy, it "offered a viable, coherent alternative to Freudian psychotherapy. …he redefined the therapeutic relationship to be different from the Freudian authoritarian pairing."<ref>(Woolfolk, 2015, p.28)</ref> 

Person-centered Therapy is often described as a humanistic therapy, but its main principles appear to have been established before those of humanistic psychology.<ref>(Merry, 1998, pp.96-103)</ref>  Arguably, "…it does not in fact have much in common with the other established humanistic therapies".<ref>(Mearns and Thorne, 2000, p.27)</ref> Despite the importance of the self to person-centered theory, the theory is fundamentally organismic and holistic in nature,<ref>(Wilkins, 2016, p.34, Tudor and Worrall, 2006, pp.45-84)</ref> embracing the full person, with the individual’s unique self-concept at the center of the unique "sum total of the biochemical, physiological, perceptual, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal behavioural subsystems constituting the person".<ref>(Wilkins, 2016, p.12)</ref> 

Rogers coined the term ''counselling'' in the 1940s because at that time psychologists were not legally permitted to provide psychotherapy in the US.  Only medical practitioners were allowed to use the term ''psychotherapy'' to describe their work.<ref>(Joseph, 2010, p.8)</ref> 

Person-centered therapy, now considered a founding work in the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] school of psychotherapies, began with Carl Rogers,<ref name="Prochaska & Norcross 2007">{{cite book |author1=Prochaska, James O. |author-link1=James O. Prochaska |author2=Norcross, John C. |author-link2=John C. Norcross |title=Systems of Psychotherapy: A Transtheoretical Analysis |year=2007 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Thomson/Brooks/Cole |isbn=978-0495007777 |oclc=71366401}}</ref>{{rp|138}} and is recognized as one of the major psychotherapy "schools" (theoretical orientations),{{clarify|date=May 2019}} along with [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[classical Adlerian psychology]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[existential therapy]], and others.<ref name="Prochaska & Norcross 2007"/>{{rp|3}}

Rogers affirmed individual personal experience as the basis and standard for living and therapeutic effect.<ref name="Prochaska & Norcross 2007"/>{{rp|142–143}} This emphasis contrasts with the dispassionate position which may be intended in other therapies, particularly the behavioral therapies. Living in the present rather than the past or future, with organismic trust, naturalistic faith in one's own thoughts and the accuracy in one's feelings, and a responsible acknowledgment of one's freedom, with a view toward participating fully in our world, contributing to other peoples' lives, are hallmarks of Rogers's person-centered therapy.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Rogers also claimed that the therapeutic process is, in essence, composed of the accomplishments made by the [[Client (business)|client]]. The client, having already progressed further along in their growth and maturation development, only progresses further with the aid of a psychologically favored environment.<ref name="Rogers">Rogers, Carl (1951). ''Client-Centered Therapy''. Cambridge Massachusetts: The Riverside Press.</ref>

Although client-centered therapy has been criticized by [[behaviorists]] for lacking structure and by [[psychoanalysts]] for actually providing a [[unconditional love|conditional relationship]],<ref name="Prochaska & Norcross 2007"/> it has been shown to be an effective{{clarify|date=May 2019}} treatment.<ref>Cooper, M., Watson, J.

== The necessary and sufficient conditions ==
Rogers (1957; 1959) stated that there are six necessary and sufficient conditions required for therapeutic change:<ref name="Prochaska & Norcross 2007"/>{{rp|142–143}}

# ''Therapist–client psychological contact'': A relationship between client and therapist must exist, and it must be a relationship in which each person's perception of the other is important.
# ''Client incongruence'': In-congruence exists between the client's experience and awareness.
# ''Therapist congruence, or genuineness'': The therapist is congruent within the therapeutic relationship. The therapist is deeply involved—they are not "acting"—and they can draw on their own experiences ([[self-disclosure]]) to facilitate the relationship.
# ''Therapist unconditional positive regard'': The therapist accepts the client unconditionally, without judgment, disapproval, or approval. This facilitates increased self-regard in the client, as they can begin to become aware of experiences in which their view of self-worth was distorted or denied.
# ''Therapist empathic understanding'': The therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client's internal frame of reference. Accurate empathy on the part of the therapist helps the client believe the therapist's unconditional regard for them.
# ''Client perception'': The client perceives, to at least a minimal degree, the therapist's unconditional positive regard and empathic understanding.

===Core conditions===
It is believed that the most important factor in successful therapy is the relational climate created by the therapist's attitude to their client. The therapist's attitude is defined by the three conditions focused on the therapist, which are often called the core conditions{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} (3,4, and 5 of the six conditions):  
# ''Congruence'': The therapist is willing to transparently relate to clients without hiding behind a professional or personal facade.
# ''Unconditional positive regard'': The therapist offers an acceptance and prizing for their client for who they are without conveying disapproving feelings, actions, or characteristics and demonstrating a willingness to attentively listen without interruption, judgement, or giving advice.
# ''Empathy'': The therapist communicates their desire to understand and appreciate their client's perspective.

==Processes==
Rogers believed that a therapist who embodies the three critical and reflexive attitudes (the three [[#Core conditions|core conditions]]) will help liberate their client to more confidently express their true feelings without fear of judgement. To achieve this, the client-centered therapist carefully avoids directly challenging their client's way of communicating themselves in the session in order to enable a deeper exploration of the issues most intimate to them and free from external referencing.<ref>[http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Person-centered-therapy.html#b "Person-centered therapy"] on the ''Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders'' website</ref> Rogers was not prescriptive in telling his clients what to do, but believed that the answers to the clients' questions were within the client and not the therapist. Accordingly, the therapist's role was to create a facilitative, empathic environment wherein the client could discover the answers for themselves.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rogers, Carl Ransom |author2=Lyon, Harold C. |author3=Tausch, Reinhard |title=On Becoming an Effective Teacher: Person-centred Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R.
