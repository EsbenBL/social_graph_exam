== Career ==

=== Academic ===
Kocherlakota's first faculty position was at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]]. He subsequently was a professor of economics at the [[University of Iowa]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[University of Minnesota]]. He served as the chair of the University of Minnesota's economic department from 2006 until 2008,<ref>{{ cite news |author= Jon Hilsenrath |author2=Mark Whitehouse |title=Unconventional Thinker Gets Fed Post |work=Wall Street Journal |page=A2 |date=1 October 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Serres |url=http://www.startribune.com/business/62912737.html?page=2&c=y |title=U economics chair is new head of Minneapolis Federal Reserve |work=[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]] |page= D1 |date=1 October 2009}}</ref> As chair of the University of Minnesota's Economics Department, Kocherlakota decisively "recruited multiple economists to the school at once" (nine new hires within a two-year span), which improved its national rank in the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' from 15th to 10th place among graduate programs in economics.<ref name=board>{{cite web|title=Narayana Kocherlakota – Federal Reserve Bank Presidents (Last update: January 28, 2014)|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/banks/pres09.htm|website=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref> Kocherlakota's research in [[monetary economics]], asset pricing, and [[public finance]] has appeared in ''[[Econometrica]]'', ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', ''[[Journal of Economic Theory]]'', ''[[Journal of Monetary Economics]]'', and ''[[Journal of Money, Credit and Banking]]''.

He is one of the founders of "New Dynamic Public Finance", which is an approach to [[optimal tax]] design "given only minimal restrictions on the set of possible tax instruments, and on the nature of shocks affecting people in the economy". It establishes a "formal connection between the problem of dynamic optimal taxation and dynamic [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent]] [[Contract theory|contracting theory]],..[which] means that the properties of solutions to principal-agent problems can be used to determine the properties of optimal tax systems".<ref>{{cite book|title=Narayana R.

He published a graduate textbook on the subject in 2010 called ''The New Dynamic Public Finance'' by [[Princeton University Press]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Narayana R.

In 2008, he was among 270 economists who signed a petition protesting the [[Obama administration]]'s [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|economic stimulus plan]] that eventually passed and signed into law in February 2009. Paid for by the [[Cato Institute]], a libertarian [[think tank]], the petition was published in several major national newspapers.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} According to Kocherlakota, he signed the petition not necessarily because he was opposed to the stimulus, but because he thought it was important to point out that the beneficial effects of an economic stimulus were not "a settled question within the academe."<ref name=rocks/>

=== Minneapolis Fed presidency ===
On October 8, 2009, Kocherlakota assumed the presidency of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis following the retirement of [[Gary H. Stern]]. Kocherlakota had been a consultant at the Minneapolis Fed since 1999.

In January 2011, Kocherlakota contested the idea that the Federal Reserve caused the [[U.S. housing bubble]] in the 2000s. He noted that "land prices started to rise in 1996 and that prices grew 11% per year between 1996 and 2001, when the Fed's target rate was between 4.75% and 6.5% ...[,] 'hardly ... loose monetary policy.'"<ref>Goldstein, Steve, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/kocherlakota-fed-didnt-cause-housing-bubble-2011-01-11-14000 "Kocherlakota: Fed didn't cause housing bubble"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'', January 11, 2011.</ref> In August 2011, he was one of the three governors who voted against the statement promising to keep the short-term interest rate near zero for two more years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Binyamin |last=Appelbaum | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/business/economy/fed-to-hold-rates-exceptionally-low-through-mid-2013.html |title=Its Forecast Dim, Fed Vows to Keep Rates Near Zero |work=New York Times |date=9 August 2011}}</ref>

After being appointed to the Minneapolis Fed in 2009, he underwent a "dramatic and unexpected intellectual transformation" from [[Monetary hawk and dove|monetary hawk to dove]], signaled in a September 2012 speech delivered at [[Gogebic Community College]] in [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]], [[Michigan]], in which he advocated that the Fed "keep the [[Federal funds rate|fed funds rate]] extraordinarily low until the unemployment rate fall[s] below 5.5 percent" to everyone's surprise.<ref name=coy>{{cite news|last1=Coy|first1=Peter|title=A Federal Reserve Dove Emerges in Michigan Speech|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-21/a-federal-reserve-dove-emerges-in-michigan-speech|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=September 21, 2012}}</ref> He said that he realized that labor-market problems like unemployment were, in fact, related to demand.<ref name="worrying">{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/03/04/dr-kocherlakota-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-quantitative-easing/|title=Dr. Kocherlakota, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Quantitative Easing|date=March 4, 2013|work=Wall Street Journal|last1=Derby|first1=Michael S.}}</ref> He cast the only dissenting vote at the October 2014 Fed meeting, during which the Committee voted to conclude the QE asset purchase program, because of his view that inflation rates are still too low and that an interest-rate hike in 2015 would be a "mistake", especially as inflation is unlikely to reach the targeted 2% until 2018.<ref name=mistake>{{cite news|author1= Michael S.
