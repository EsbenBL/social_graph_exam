It is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|largest country in the world by area]], covering over {{convert|17|e6km2|e6mi2}}, and encompassing more than one-eighth of Earth's inhabited land area. Russia extends across [[Time in Russia|eleven time zones]], and has the [[List of countries and territories by land borders|most borders of any country]] in the world, with [[borders of Russia|sixteen sovereign nations]].{{efn|Russia shares land borders with fourteen [[sovereign nation]]s, and has [[Maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] with the United States and Japan, and borders the two [[partially recognized states|partially recognized]] breakaway states of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]].}} It has a population of 146.2 million; and is the [[List of European countries by population|most populous country]] in Europe, and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|ninth-most populous country]] in the world. [[Moscow]], the capital, is the [[List of European cities by population|largest city in Europe]], while [[Saint Petersburg]] is the nation's [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|second-largest city]] and cultural centre. [[Russians]] are the largest [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European nation]]; they speak [[Russian language|Russian]], the most spoken [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]], and the most spoken [[native language]] in Europe.

The [[East Slavs]] emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The [[medieval]] state of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] arose in the 9th century. In 988, it adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined [[Russian culture]] for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated until it was finally reunified by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] in the 15th century. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and [[Russian explorers|exploration]] to become the [[Russian Empire]], the [[List of largest empires|third-largest empire]] in history. Following the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] became the largest and leading [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent]] of the [[Soviet Union]], the world's first constitutionally [[socialist state]], which had a [[one-party state|one-party system]] throughout most of its existence. The Soviet Union played a [[Eastern Front (World War II)|decisive role]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in [[World War II]], and emerged as a [[superpower]] and rival to the United States during the [[Cold War]]. The Soviet era saw some of the [[Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records|most significant technological achievements]] of the 20th century, including the world's [[Sputnik|first human-made satellite]] and the launching of the [[Yuri Gagarin|first human in space]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation. In the aftermath of the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1993]], a new [[Constitution of Russia|constitution]] was adopted, and Russia has since been governed as a [[federation|federal]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic. [[Vladimir Putin]] has dominated Russia's political system [[2000 Russian presidential election|since 2000]], and [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|his government]] has been accused of [[authoritarianism]], numerous [[Human rights in Russia|human rights abuses]], and [[Corruption in Russia|corruption]].

Russia is a [[great power]], and is considered a [[potential superpower]]. It is ranked 52nd in the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]], with a [[Healthcare in Russia|universal healthcare system]], and a [[Free education|free]] [[Education in Russia|university education]]. Russia's [[Economy of Russia|economy]] is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|eleventh-largest by nominal GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|sixth-largest by PPP]].

{{Main|Rus' people|Rus' (name)}}

The name ''Russia'' is derived from [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], a medieval state populated primarily by the [[East Slavs]].<ref name="EarlyH">{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Glenn E.|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/2.htm|title=Russia - Early History|year=1998|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=Federal Research Division of the [[Library of Congress]]|access-date=29 June 2021}}</ref> However, the proper name became more prominent in later history, and the country typically was called by its inhabitants "Русская земля" (''Russkaya zemlya''), which can be translated as "Russian land".<ref>Kuchkin V. A. Russian land // Ancient Russia in the medieval world / Institute of General History of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Ed. E. A. Melnikova, V. Ya. Petrukhina . - M .: Ladomir, 2014. - S. 697-698.</ref> In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted as ''[[Kievan Rus']]'' by modern historiography. The [[Rus (name)|name ''Rus{{'}}'']] itself comes from the early medieval [[Rus' people]], a group of [[Norsemen|Norse]] merchants and warriors who relocated from across the [[Baltic Sea]] and founded a state centred on [[Novgorod]] that later became Kievan Rus'.<ref>{{cite book|title=Viking Rus|last=Duczko|first=Wladyslaw|year=2004|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=978-90-04-13874-2|pages=10–11}}</ref>

A [[Medieval Latin]] version of the name Rus' was [[Ruthenia]], which was used as one of several designations for East Slavic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] regions, and commonly as a designation for the lands of Rus'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nazarenko|first=Aleksandr Vasilevich|author-link=Aleksandr Nazarenko|script-title=ru:Древняя Русь на международных путях: междисциплинарные очерки культурных, торговых, политических связей IX-XII веков|year=2001|publisher=Languages of the Rus' culture|isbn=978-5-7859-0085-1|pages=40, 42–45, 49–50|chapter=1.

Under [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721, and became one of the European great powers. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700−1721), forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]), as well as the [[Governorate of Estonia]] and [[Livonia]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade. In 1703, on the Baltic Sea, Peter founded [[Saint Petersburg]] as Russia's new capital. Throughout his rule, [[Government reform of Peter the Great|sweeping reforms were made]], which brought significant Western European cultural influences to Russia.<ref name="early">{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Glenn E.|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/4.htm|title=Russia - Early Imperial Russia|year=1998|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=Federal Research Division of the [[Library of Congress]]|access-date=25 June 2021}}</ref>

The reign of Peter&nbsp;I's daughter [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] in 1741–62 saw Russia's participation in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63). During this conflict, Russia annexed [[East Prussia]] and even reached the gates of [[Berlin]]. However, upon Elizabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by pro-Prussian [[Peter&nbsp;III of Russia]].<ref name="early"/>

[[Catherine the Great|Catherine&nbsp;II]] ("the Great"), who ruled in 1762–96, presided over the Age of [[Russian Enlightenment]]. She extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe, and thus making Russia the most populous country in Europe. In the south, after the successful [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the [[Crimean Khanate]]. As a result of victories over [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] through the [[Russo-Persian Wars]], by the first half of the 19th century, Russia also made significant territorial gains in [[Transcaucasia]] and the [[North Caucasus]].<ref name="early"/> Catherine's successor, her son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], was [[Personality and reputation of Paul I of Russia|unstable and focused predominantly on domestic issues]].

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Russia joined alliances with various other European empires, and fought against [[First French Empire|France]]. The [[French invasion of Russia]] at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold [[Russian winter]] led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which more than 95% of the pan-European [[Grande Armée]] perished. Led by [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Barclay de Tolly]], the [[Imperial Russian Army]] ousted Napoleon from the country and drove throughout Europe in the [[war of the Sixth Coalition]], finally entering [[Paris]]. Alexander&nbsp;I controlled Russia's delegation at the [[Congress of Vienna]], which defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe.<ref name="ruling"/>

The officers who pursued Napoleon into Western Europe brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia with them and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1825–55), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe, was disrupted by defeat in the [[Crimean War]].<ref name="ruling"/> Between 1847 and 1851, around one million people died across the country due to [[cholera]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosking|first=Geoffrey|date=2001|title=Russia and the Russians: A History|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=9|isbn=978-0-674-00473-3}}</ref>

Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] (1855–81) enacted significant changes throughout the country, including the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. These reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernized the Imperial Russian Army, which liberated much of the [[Balkans]] from Ottoman rule in the aftermath of the [[1877–78 Russo-Turkish War]]. During most of the 19th and early 20th century, Russia and [[British Empire|Britain]] vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining Ottoman Empire, Qajar Iran, and the [[Qing dynasty]]. This rivalry between the two major European empires came to be known as "[[The Great Game]]".<ref name="ninteenth">{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Glenn E.|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/6.htm|title=Russia - Transformation of Russia in the Nineteenth Century|year=1998|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=Federal Research Division of the [[Library of Congress]]|access-date=25 June 2021}}</ref>

The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander&nbsp;II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son
[[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] (1881–94) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, [[Nicholas&nbsp;II]] (1894–1917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905]], triggered by the unsuccessful [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the demonstration incident known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[Russian Constitution of 1906]]), including granting the [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]].<ref name="ninteenth"/>

An alternative socialist establishment co-existed, the [[Petrograd Soviet]], wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called ''[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]''. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it, and eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the Soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first [[socialist state]].<ref name="revo"/>

Russia took up the responsibility for settling the Soviet Union's external debts, even though its population made up just half of it at the time of its dissolution. In 1992, most consumer price controls were eliminated, causing extreme inflation and significantly devaluing the ruble. With a devalued ruble, the Russian government struggled to pay back its debts to internal debtors, as well as to international institutions. Despite significant attempts at economic restructuring, Russia's debt outpaced GDP growth. High budget deficits coupled with increasing capital flight and inability to pay back debts, caused the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], and resulted in a further GDP decline.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Owen|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=David O.|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/nft/2003/russia/index.htm|title=Russia Rebounds|date=2003|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|isbn=978-1-4519-2073-4}}</ref>

The sheer size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the [[humid continental climate]], which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southwest. Mountains in the south and east obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and Pacific oceans, while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.
Most of [[Northwest Russia]] and Siberia has a [[subarctic climate]], with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly [[Sakha]], where the Northern [[Pole of Cold]] is located with the record low temperature of {{convert|−71.2|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}),<ref name="Arctic"/> and more moderate winters elsewhere. Russia's vast stretch of land along the Arctic Ocean and the [[Russian Arctic islands]] have a [[polar climate]].<ref name="Climate">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/24.htm|title=Climate|editor=Glenn E.

The coastal part of [[Krasnodar Krai]] on the Black Sea, most notably [[Sochi]], and some coastal and interior strips of the [[North Caucasus]] possess a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild and wet winters. In many regions of East Siberia and the Russian Far East, winter is dry compared to summer; while other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. The westernmost parts of Kaliningrad Oblast on the [[Vistula Spit]], and some parts in the south of Krasnodar Krai and the North Caucasus have an [[oceanic climate]]. The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some southernmost silvers of Siberia, possess a [[semi-arid climate]].<ref name="climate1"/>

Throughout much of the territory, there are only two distinct seasons—winter and summer—as spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low and extremely high temperatures.<ref name="Climate"/> The coldest month is January (February on the coastline); the warmest is usually July. Great ranges of temperature are typical. In winter, temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east. Summers can be quite hot, even in Siberia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Drozdov|first1=V.
