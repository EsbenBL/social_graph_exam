==Career==
Horst Helle received a business degree from the [[University of Hamburg|university]] in his hometown of [[Hamburg]] before receiving an MBA from the [[University of Kansas]] on a Fulbright Scholarship, 1956-1957.<ref>[http://www.horst-helle.de Horst Helle website - Curriculum vitae]</ref> Thereupon, he returned to the [[University of Hamburg]] and obtained the Ph.D. in sociology as well as the license to teach sociology as [[Privatdozent]]. He has since held tenured professorships at the [[RWTH Aachen University]], the [[University of Vienna]], and the [[University of Munich]] where, between 1973 and 2002, he was Professor of Sociology and Co-director of the Institute for Sociology.

==Contributions to sociology==
Helle's work is mainly concerned with analyzing the development of [[Symbolic Interactionism]] since [[Herbert Blumer]], although he does not single out Blumer's contribution. Instead the latter is positioned and discussed in the context of the evolution of the so-called '[[Verstehen]]' tradition of interpretive sociology. Helle has specifically looked at the path taken by European sociology in its tension between [[positivism]] and [[neo-Kantianism]] since the writing of [[Georg Simmel]]. He connects this tradition to Blumer's indebtedness to [[George Herbert Mead]], the widely acknowledged “father” of Symbolic Interactionism. In this theoretical continuity Helle also discusses the work of [[Anselm Strauss]], [[Tamotsu Shibutani]] and, particularly, [[Erving Goffman]]. Most of Helle’s substantive work has centered on [[Transformation of culture|cultural change]], [[Sociology of religion|religion]], [[Sociology of the family|the family]], and recently mainland [[China]].<ref>[http://www.horst-helle.de/forschung.html Horst Helle website - Forschungsgebiete]</ref>
