== Research==

Karthik Muralidharan's research focuses on [[Education economics|education]], [[Health economics|health]] and [[social protection]], the measurement of the quality of public service delivery, programme evaluation, and improvements to the effectiveness of public spending (especially in developing countries). In particular, Muralidharan has contributed to the research of public servant absenteeism in developing countries, with a focus on teachers and health workers, e.g. finding that on average ca. 19% of teachers and 35% of health workers were absent on a given work day in a sample of developing countries ([[Bangladesh]], [[Ecuador]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Peru]] and [[Uganda]]), and that among those present many weren't working.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v20y2006i1p91-116.html Chaudhury, N. et al. (2006). Missing in Action: Teacher and Health Worker Absence in Developing Countries. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 20(1), pp. 91-116.]</ref> Focusing on teacher absenteeism in India, further findings include that higher pay isn't generally correlated with higher presence, presence decreases in age and rank, and that absenteeism cannot be explained by teachers being outsiders to the communities in which they are teaching (as comparable local teachers have similar absence rates); moreover, private school teachers are only slightly less likely to be absent than public school teachers unless there is local competition between private and public schools.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/jeurec/v3y2005i2-3p658-667.html Chaudhury, N. et al. (2005). Teacher absence in India: A Snapshot. ''Journal of the European Economic Association'', 3(2-3), pp. 658-667.]</ref> In another study on education, Muralidharan (together with Venkatesh Sundararaman) found that conditioning teacher pay on their performance for two years was effective in increasing students' performance in math and language tests by 0.27 and 0.17 standard deviations, respectively, in schools in [[Andhra Pradesh]].<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/doi10.1086-659655.html Muralidharan, K., Sundararaman, V. (2011). Teacher Performance Pay: Experimental Evidence from India. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 119(1), pp. 39-77.]</ref>
