Meislin]], [https://archive.today/20130204085944/http://theharvardcrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=495202 Popkin Faces Jail Sentence In Contempt of Court Case], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', March 22, 1972.</ref> The Faculty Council later passed a resolution condemning the government's interrogation of scholars on the grounds that "an unlimited right of grand juries to ask any question and to expose a witness to citations for contempt could easily threaten scholarly research."<ref name=Meislin/>
