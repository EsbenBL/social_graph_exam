He received his [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1944. He received his [[PhD]] in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1951.

===Career===
Schelling served with the [[Marshall Plan]] in [[Europe]], the [[White House]], and the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]] from 1948 to 1953.<ref name=cv>{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae: Thomas C.

===Personal life===
Schelling was married to Corinne Tigay Saposs from 1947 to 1991, with whom he had four sons. Later in 1991 he married Alice M. Coleman, who brought two sons to the marriage; they became his stepsons.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thomas C.

Schelling died on December 13, 2016 in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] from complications following a hip fracture at the age of 95.<ref name=":1" />

Schelling's family auctioned his Nobel award medal, fetching $187,000. They donated this money to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], a nonprofit that fights hate, bigotry, and advocates for civil rights through litigation. Alice Schelling said her late husband had credited ''[[Smoky the Cowhorse]]'' by [[Will James (artist)|Will James]], the winner of the [[Newbery Medal]] in 1927, as the most influential book he had read.<ref>Levin, Sala (June 8, 2018).

==Notable works==
{{anchor|The Strategy of Conflict}}

===''The Strategy of Conflict'' (1960)===
''The Strategy of Conflict'', which Schelling published in 1960,<ref name=":5">{{cite book |title=The Strategy of Conflict |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |year=1980 |edition=Reprint, illustrated and revised. |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674840317 |page=309 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC&q=thomas+schelling+strategy+of+conflict |access-date=September 21, 2010}}</ref> pioneered the study of bargaining and [[strategic management|strategic behavior]] in what he refers to as "conflict behavior." ''The Times Literary Supplement'' in 1995 ranked it as one of the hundred most influential books in the 50 years since 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.interleaves.org/~rteeter/grttls.html|title=100 Most Influential Books Since the War (TLS)|first=Robert|last=Teeter|website=www.interleaves.org}}</ref> In this book Schelling introduced concepts such as the [[Focal point (game theory)|"focal point"]] and "credible commitment."

The strategic view toward conflict that Schelling encourages in this work is equally "rational" and "successful."<ref name=":5" /> He believes that it cannot be based merely on one's intelligence, but must also address the "advantages" associated with a course of action. The advantages gleaned, he says, should be firmly fixed in a value system that is both "explicit" and "consistent."<ref name=":5" />

Conflict too has a distinct meaning. In Schelling's approach, it is not enough to defeat your opponent. Instead, one must seize opportunities to cooperate. And in most cases, there are many. Only on the rarest of occasions, in what is known as "pure conflict," he points out, will the interests of participants be implacably opposed.<ref name=":5" /> He uses the example of "a war of complete extermination" to illustrate this phenomenon.<ref name=":5" />

Cooperation, where available, may take many forms, and thus could potentially involve everything from "deterrence, limited war, and disarmament" to "negotiation."<ref name=":5" /> Indeed, it is through such actions that participants are left with less of a conflict and more of a "bargaining situation."<ref name=":5" /> The bargaining itself is best thought of in terms of the other participant's actions, as any gains one might realize are highly dependent upon the "choices or decisions" of their opponent.<ref name=":5" />

Communication between parties, though, is another matter entirely. Verbal or written communication is known as "explicit," and involves such activities as "offering concessions."<ref name=":5" /> What happens, though, when this type of communication becomes impossible or improbable? This is when something called "tacit maneuvers" become important.<ref name=":5" /> Think of this as action-based communication. Schelling uses the example of one's occupation or evacuation of strategic territory to illustrate this latter communication method.

In an article celebrating Schelling's Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics,<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101101336.html "A Nobel Laureate Who's Got Game"], ''The Washington Post'', October 12, 2005.</ref> [[Michael Kinsley]], ''[[Washington Post]]'' [[op-ed|op‑ed]] columnist and one of Schelling's former students, anecdotally summarizes Schelling's reorientation of game theory thus: "[Y]ou're standing at the edge of a cliff, chained by the ankle to someone else. You'll be released, and one of you will get a large prize, as soon as the other gives in. How do you persuade the other guy to give in, when the only method at your disposal—threatening to push him off the cliff—would doom you both? Answer: You start dancing, closer and closer to the edge. That way, you don't have to convince him that you would do something totally irrational: plunge him and yourself off the cliff. You just have to convince him that you are prepared to take a higher risk than he is of accidentally falling off the cliff. If you can do that, you win."

===''Arms and Influence'' (1966)===
Schelling's theories about war were extended in ''Arms and Influence'', published in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300002211|title=Arms and Influence – Schelling, Thomas C. – Yale University Press|date=January 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107193224/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300002211|archive-date=January 7, 2016}}</ref> The blurb states that it "carries forward the analysis so brilliantly begun in his earlier ''The Strategy of Conflict'' (1960) and ''Strategy and Arms Control'' (with Morton Halperin, 1961), and makes a significant contribution to the growing literature on modern war and [[diplomacy]]." Chapter headings include ''The Diplomacy of Violence'', ''The Diplomacy of Ultimate Survival'' and ''The Dynamics of Mutual Alarm''.

Within this work, Schelling discusses military capabilities and how they can be used as bargaining power. Instead of just considering the choices available to you on a surface level, you can think ahead to try to influence the other party to come to the conclusion you want. Specifically he mentions the actions taken by the U.S. during the Cuban and Berlin crises and how they functioned not just as preparation for war, but signals as well. For example, Schelling points out that the bombing of North Vietnam "is as much coercive as tactical".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300143379/arms-and-influence|title=Arms and Influence {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> Not only was the bombing to cripple their enemies armies, but it also served to bring Vietnam to the table for negotiations. Much of this writing was influenced largely due to Schelling's personal interest in Game Theory and its application to nuclear armaments. By suggesting nuclear weapons as a deterrent instead of a solution, Schelling was able to help prevent another nuclear bombing from happening.

===''Micromotives and Macrobehavior'' (1978)===
In 1969 and 1971, Schelling published widely cited articles dealing with [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] dynamics and what he termed "a general theory of [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping]]."<ref>Thomas C. Schelling (1969) "Models of segregation," ''American Economic Review'', 1969, 59(2), [http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic185351.files/shelling1.pdf 488–493].<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; _____ (1971). "Dynamic Models of Segregation," ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'', 1(2), pp. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140801170215/http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf 143–186].</ref> In these papers he showed that a preference that one's neighbors be of the same color, or even a preference for a mixture "up to some limit," could lead to total [[residential segregation|segregation]], thus arguing that motives, malicious or not, were indistinguishable as to explaining the phenomenon of complete local separation of distinct groups. He used coins on graph paper to demonstrate his theory by placing pennies and dimes in different patterns on the "board" and then moving them one by one if they were in an "unhappy" situation.

Schelling's dynamics has been cited as a way of explaining variations that are found in what are regarded as meaningful differences{{spaced ndash}}gender, age, race, ethnicity, language, sexual preference, and religion. Once a cycle of such change has begun, it may have a self-sustaining momentum. His 1978 book ''Micromotives and Macrobehavior'' expanded on and generalized these themes<ref>Thomas C. Schelling (1978) ''Micromotives and Macrobehavior'', Norton. [http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-32946-9/ Description], [https://books.google.com/books?id=DenWKRgqzWMC&printsec=find&pg=PA1=#v=onepage&q&f=false preview].</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schelling|first1=Thomas C|journal=Handbook of Computational Economics|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|pages=1639–1644|title=Some Fun, Thirty-Five Years Ago|volume=2|doi=10.1016/S1574-0021(05)02037-X|isbn=978-0444512536}}</ref> and is often cited in the literature of [[agent-based computational economics]].

==Global warming==
Schelling was involved in the [[global warming]] debate since chairing a commission for President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1980. He believed [[climate change]] poses a serious threat to developing nations, but that the threat to the United States was exaggerated. He wrote that,

<blockquote>Today, little of our gross domestic product is produced outdoors, and therefore, little is susceptible to climate. Agriculture and forestry are less than 3 percent of total output, and little else is much affected. Even if agricultural productivity declined by a third over the next half-century, the per capita GNP we might have achieved by 2050 we would still achieve in 2051. Considering that agricultural productivity in most parts of the world continues to improve (and that many crops may benefit directly from enhanced photosynthesis due to increased carbon dioxide), it is not at all certain that the net impact on agriculture will be negative or much noticed in the developed world.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Schelling, Thomas C.|editor1-last=Henderson|editor1-first=David R.|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|date=2007|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|edition=1st|chapter-url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/GreenhouseEffect.html|access-date=7 December 2017|chapter=Greenhouse Effect}}</ref></blockquote>

Drawing on his experience with the [[Marshall Plan]] after [[World War&nbsp;II]], he argued that addressing global warming is a [[bargaining problem]]: if the world were able to reduce emissions, poor countries would receive most of the benefits, but rich countries would bear most of the costs.

==Contributions to popular culture==
[[Stanley Kubrick]] read an article Schelling wrote that included a description of the [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]] novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'', and conversations between Kubrick, Schelling, and George eventually led to the 1964 movie ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]''.<ref>Thomas C. Schelling, 2006 prologue to 'Meteors, Mischief, and War', in ''Strategies of commitment and other essays'', Harvard University Press, 2006.</ref>

Schelling is also cited for the first known use of the phrase [[collateral damage]] in his May 1961 article ''Dispersal, Deterrence, and Damage''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=INFORMS PubsOnline|journal=Operations Research|volume=9|issue=3|pages=363–370|doi=10.1287/opre.9.3.363|year=1961|last1=Schelling|first1=T. C.}}</ref>

In his book ''Choice and Consequence'',<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schelling, Thomas C., 1921–2016.|title=Choice and consequence|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674127706|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=9893879}}</ref> he explored various topics such as [[nuclear terrorism]], [[blackmail]], [[daydreaming]], and [[euthanasia]], from a [[behavioral economics]] point of view.
