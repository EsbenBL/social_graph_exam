===Civil War===
[[File:UMD Morrill Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]], built in 1898, is the oldest academic building on campus.]]
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers under Brigadier General [[Bradley Tyler Johnson]] moved past the college on July 12, 1864 as part of Jubal Early's raid on [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Benjamin|title=The Confederate Army's "Old South Ball" at the University of Maryland: Fact or Fiction?|url=http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2015/06/30/confederate-armys-old-south-ball-university-maryland-fact-or-fiction|website=Boundary Stones|access-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805162525/http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2015/06/30/confederate-armys-old-south-ball-university-maryland-fact-or-fiction|archive-date=August 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> By the end of the war, financial problems forced the administrators to sell off {{convert|200|acre}} of land, and the continuing decline in enrollment sent the Maryland Agricultural College into bankruptcy. For the next two years the campus was used as a boys preparatory school.<ref name="umtimeline" /> 

Following the Civil War, in February 1866, the Maryland legislature assumed half ownership of the school. The college thus became in part a state institution. By October 1867, the school reopened with 11 students. In 1868, the former Confederate admiral [[Franklin Buchanan]] was appointed President of the school, and in his tenure of just over a year, he reorganized it, established a system of strict economy in its business transactions, applied some of its revenues for the paying off of its debts, raised its standards, and attracted patrons through his personal influence: enrollment grew to 80 at the time of his resignation, and the school's debt was soon paid off. In 1873, [[Samuel Jones (Confederate Army officer)|Samuel Jones]], a former Confederate Major General, became president of the college.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-12-13|title=History and Mission – University Presidents: Samuel Jones|url=https://www.umd.edu/history-and-mission/samuel-jones|access-date=2020-10-01|website=www.umd.edu|publisher=University of Maryland|location=College Park, MD|language=en}}</ref>

Twenty years later, the federally funded Agricultural Experiment Station was established there. During the same period, state laws granted the college regulatory powers in several areas—including controlling farm disease, inspecting feed, establishing a state weather bureau and geological survey, and housing the board of forestry.<ref name="umtimeline" /> [[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]] (the oldest instructional building still in use on campus) was built the following year.<ref name="umtimeline" />

===The Great Fire of 1912===
[[File:MAC fire 1912.jpg|thumb|The campus during The Great Fire of 1912]]
On November 29, 1912, a fire destroyed the barracks where the students were housed, all the school's records, and most of the academic buildings, leaving only [[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]] untouched. There were no injuries or fatalities, and all but two students returned to the university and insisted on classes continuing.<ref name="umtimeline"/> Students were housed by families in neighboring towns until housing could be rebuilt, although a new administration building was not built until the 1940s.<ref name="umtimeline"/>
A large brick and concrete compass inlaid in the ground designates the former center of campus as it existed in 1912.<!-- A transition between what the history included between 1912 and 1916 should be included so readers know what happened between the fire and the state taking control -->

===Modern history===
[[File:Univ of Maryland campus 1938.jpg|thumb|The University of Maryland campus as it appeared in 1938 before the dramatic expansion engineered by [[Curley Byrd|President Byrd]]]]
The state took control of the school in 1916, and the institution was renamed '''Maryland State College'''. That year, the first female students enrolled at the school. On April 9, 1920, the college became part of the existing [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|University of Maryland]], replacing [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College, Annapolis]] as the university's undergraduate campus.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cordell|first1=Eugene Fauntleroy|title=Historical Sketch of the University of Maryland, School of Medicine (1807–1890)|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalsketc00cord|date=1891|publisher=I.

In 1925 the university was accredited by the [[Association of American Universities]].<ref name="umtimeline"/>

By the time the first black students enrolled at the university in 1951, enrollment had grown to nearly 10,000 students—4,000 of whom were women. Prior to 1951, many black students in Maryland were enrolled at the [[University of Maryland, Eastern Shore]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/university-maryland-eastern-shore-1887 |title=University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (1886– ) &#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date=July 1, 1970 |access-date=December 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124004014/http://blackpast.org/?q=aah%2Funiversity-maryland-eastern-shore-1887 |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1957, President [[Wilson Homer Elkins|Wilson H. Elkins]] made a push to increase academic standards at the university. His efforts resulted in the creation of one of the first Academic Probation Plans. The first year the plan went into effect, 1,550 students (18% of the total student body) faced expulsion.

On October 19, 1957, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom attended her first and only college football game at the University of Maryland after expressing interest in seeing a typical American sport during her first tour of the United States. The [[Maryland Terrapins]] beat the [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] 21 to 7 in the historical game now referred to as "The Queen's Game".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://umdarchives.wordpress.com/tag/queens-game/|title=Queen's Game – Terrapin Tales|website=umdarchives.wordpress.com|access-date=August 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831212024/https://umdarchives.wordpress.com/tag/queens-game/|archive-date=August 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a massive restructuring of the state's higher education system in 1988, the school was designated as the flagship campus of the newly formed [[University of Maryland System]] (later changed to the University System of Maryland in 1997), and was formally named the University of Maryland, College Park. All of the five campuses in the former network were designated as distinct campuses in the new system. However, in 1997 the [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed legislation allowing the University of Maryland, College Park, to be known simply as the University of Maryland, recognizing the campus' role as the flagship institution of the University System of Maryland.<ref>{{cite web |last=Office of University Communications |title=University of Maryland Identity Guide |url=http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/media/identityguide.pdf |access-date=April 22, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418112109/http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/media/identityguide.pdf |archive-date=April 18, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:UMD stairway.JPG|thumb|A stairway in South Campus]]
The university hosts "living-learning" programs which allow students with similar academic interests to live in the same residential community, take specialized courses, and perform research in those areas of expertise. An example is the Honors College, which is geared towards undergraduate students meeting high academic requirements and consists of several of the university's honors programs. The Honors College welcomes students into a community of faculty and undergraduates. The Honors College offers seven living and learning programs: Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students, Design Cultures and Creativity, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Honors Humanities, Gemstone, Integrated Life Sciences, and University Honors.<ref>{{cite web|last=University of Maryland|title=Honors College University of Maryland|access-date=June 18, 2010|url=http://www.honors.umd.edu/overview.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610021941/http://www.honors.umd.edu/overview.php|archive-date=June 10, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

McKeldin Mall serves as the center of campus. On the east and west ends of McKeldin Mall lie the Main Administration Building and [[McKeldin Library]]. Academic buildings surround McKeldin Mall on the north and south ends, and are the homes to many departments in the [[University of Maryland College of Behavioral and Social Sciences|College of Behavioral and Social Sciences]], College of Arts and Humanities, and the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. West of McKeldin Mall is the North Hill Community, and south of McKeldin Mall lies [[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]] and the Morrill Quad, which was the original center of campus. South of the Morrill Quad are the South Hill and South Campus Commons Communities, and to the southwest is the Southwest Mall and the [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]]. Running parallel to McKeldin Mall to the north is Campus Drive, the main thoroughfare through campus.

The [[Adele H. Stamp Student Union]] sits along Campus Drive near the center of campus, and serves as a [[transit center]] for campus, where [[Shuttle-UM]] (the university's bus service) and municipal buses pick up and drop off passengers. Hornbake Plaza, home to [[Hornbake Library]] and several buildings housing academic departments, also lies on Campus Drive, east of Stamp. Stamp serves as a center which includes a food court, bowling alley, book store, and spaces made available for major events, such as freshman orientation and career fairs.

Starting in 2010, the University System of Maryland and the Department of General Services began three projects that were to be continued for the next twenty years. The three projects included: a solar project in [[Mount St. Mary's University]], a wind project in [[Western Maryland]], and another wind project in [[West Virginia]]. The first of these projects, the solar project, is a 16 megawatt project. The first wind project is 10 megawatts, and the second is 55 megawatts.

The projects will allow the university to receive 15 percent of their purchased energy from these renewable energy resources. Also in 2010, Ellicott Dining Hall installed solar panels which would provide up to 30 percent of the energy for heating its water. The university installed 20 panels with three solar storage tanks, pumps, temperature sensors, and controls. The system will increasingly provide more of the dining hall's water needs.<ref name=sustainability.umd.edu />

In October 2013 the university's College of Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSOS) became the university's first college to form their own Sustainability Task Force. In April 2014 the Task Force produced BSOS's Sustainability Plan to advance campus sustainability and complement the university's Climate Action Plan to help the university become a national model of a green university. It is the first plan of its kind at the college level at the university, and was designed to serve as a guide for other colleges to join BSOS in this effort to improve the sustainability of the campus and community as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/about-us/sustainability-plan|title=Sustainability Plan|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423114637/http://bsos.umd.edu/about-us/sustainability-plan|archive-date=April 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2014 the BSOS Sustainability Task Force expanded to include a student Sustainability Task Force.

===Residential life===
[[File:UMD Talbot.JPG|thumb|Talbot Hall in the South Hill community]]
[[File:UMD brick entryway.JPG|thumb|right|Brick entryway near the South Hill Community]]
There are two main residential areas on campus, North Campus and South Campus, which are further divided into seven residential communities. North Campus is made up of Cambridge Community (which consists of five residence halls), Denton Community (which currently consists of four halls, including Oakland hall which opened in the fall semester of 2011), and Ellicott Community (consisting of three halls). Under construction right now is the Heritage Community (which consists of two resident halls) with an anticipated opening of Fall 2021. 

South Campus includes the North Hill Community, made up of nine [[Georgian-style]] halls and Prince Frederick hall (which opened in the fall semester of 2014) immediately west of [[McKeldin Mall]], South Hill Community, made up of fourteen small residence halls for upperclassmen, Leonardtown Community, which offers apartment-style living and is further divided into Old Leonardtown (consisting of six buildings) and New Leonardtown (also consisting of six buildings), the South Campus Commons Community, which consists of seven apartment-style buildings (the seventh and most recent building being opened in January 2010), and the Courtyards, a garden style apartment community in north campus consisting of seven buildings.

The South Campus Commons Community and Courtyards, while built on campus, are managed by a private company, Capstone On-Campus Management, as part of a public-private partnership between the company and the University of Maryland.

The university does not have family housing. As of 2011, some students with families have advocated for the addition of family housing.<ref>Romas, Maria.

===Dining===
There are three dining halls on campus: the North Campus Dining Hall ("The Diner") is between the Ellicott Community, the South Campus Dining Hall is near the South Hill and South Campus Commons communities, and the 251 North Dining Hall is in the Denton Community. As of the fall of 2016, the University of Maryland Dining Services changed their dining plan from a pay a la carte to an all-you-can-eat style dining experience. A [[Adele H.

In 1932, [[Curley Byrd]]—who served as the university's football and baseball coach, athletic director, and president—proposed adopting the [[diamondback terrapin]] as a mascot.
