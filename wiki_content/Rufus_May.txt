This eventually led to three admissions to [[Homerton University Hospital|Hackney Hospital]] within 14 months.<ref name="6 Aug 2006" />

After a year of receiving psychiatric drug treatment Rufus May decided to stop being involved with psychiatric services and stop taking the drugs he was being prescribed, he then used exercise, creative activities, social relationships and voluntary work to regain his well being.<ref name="spying">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/sep/20/publicsectorcareers.careers |title=Spying on the psychiatrists: Insider who has challenged the treatment of mental illness | work=The Guardian | date= 20 September 2000 |accessdate=23 March 2010 | location=London | first=Adam | last=James}}</ref>

== Clinical approach ==
Rufus May has used his professional knowledge and own experiences of psychosis to focus on developing services that are more patient centered and therapeutic approaches that are more collaborative, without relying on [[Biopsychiatry controversy|chemical imbalance theories]] of mental distress.<ref name="18 March 2007" /> For example, he works with those experiencing [[auditory hallucination]]s by conversing directly with the voice to help discover the meaning of these dissociative experiences.  He draws upon the [[Nonviolent Communication]] style developed by [[Marshall Rosenberg]] and mindfulness.

His approach received considerable publicity when it was the subject of ''The Doctor Who Hears Voices'', a 2008 British television documentary broadcast on [[Channel 4]] about a junior doctor helped by May to overcome her experiences of hearing voices.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/a-dialogue-with-myself-808941.html|title= A dialogue with myself | work = The Independent | date= 15 April 2008|accessdate=20 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211352|title= Review of ''The Doctor Who Hears Voices'' (2008)| work = [[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> Directed by Leo Regan, the documentary depicts the therapy which May provided to the junior doctor, played by actress [[Ruth Wilson (actress)|Ruth Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/D/dr_hears_voices/programme.html |title=Channel 4 The doctor who hears voices |accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref> The programme created a significant reaction<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychminded.co.uk/news/news2008/may08/psychologist001.htm |title=News on the film reaction |work=Psychminded |accessdate=19 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113005535/http://www.psychminded.co.uk/news/news2008/may08/psychologist001.htm |archivedate=13 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with both support and criticism of May's approach<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frontierpsychiatrist.co.uk/the-doctor-who-hears-voices-again |title=Frontier Psychiatrist blog |accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/apr/22/lastnightstvthedoctorwho |title= Last night's TV: The Doctor Who Hears Voices | work = The Guardian | date= 22 April 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010 | location=London | first=Nancy | last=Banks-Smith}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/27/television.tvandradioarts |title= Hear the voices from the other side. | work = The Observer | date= 27 April 2008  |accessdate=23 March 2010 | location=London | first=Kathryn | last=Flett}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/television/2008/04/hears-voices-channel-doctor |title=A dangerous experiment. | work = New Statesman | last= Cooke | first= Rachel | date = 24 April 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2008/04/hearing_voices_with_.html |work=Mind Hacks | title=Hearing voices with your head in the sand |date= 22 April 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3764148.ece |title= The dangerous methods of Leo Regan in ''The Doctor Who Hears Voices''|work=The Times | date= 19 April 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010 | location=London | first=Paul | last=Hoggart}}</ref> and was a 2008 finalist in the Mind Mental health media awards.<ref name="2009 award">{{cite web |url=http://www.mind.org.uk/mediaawards/previous_winners |title=Mind Media Awards 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref>

==Religion and culture==
May has expressed sympathy for individuals who come from various cultural backgrounds or those who hold specific religious beliefs in regards to proper treatment. 

He has stated that "...for many people their voices are spiritual entities...we are working alongside traditional spiritual healers to create healing workshops that will help people deal with negative spirits. To insist on medicalizing this experience is now being recognized as culturally oppressive and colonial."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hewis |first1=Elaine |last2=Knight |first2=Tamasin |title=Beyond Belief: Alternative Ways of Working with Delusions, Obsessions and Unusual Experiences |date=2013 |publisher=Peter Lehmann Publishing}}</ref>
