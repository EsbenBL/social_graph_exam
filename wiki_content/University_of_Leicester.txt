The '''University of Leicester''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-leicester.ogg|ˈ|l|ɛ|s|t|ər}} {{respell|LES|tər}}) is a [[public university|public]] research university based in [[Leicester]], England. The main campus is south of the city centre, adjacent to [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]]. The university's predecessor, '''University College, Leicester''', gained university status in 1957.

The university had an income of £323.1 million in 2019/20, of which £57 million was from research grants.<ref name=Leicester2020/>

The university received media attention for the invention of [[genetic fingerprinting]], and for contributing to the discovery and identification of the remains of [[exhumation of Richard III|King Richard III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard III Society pays tribute to exemplary archaeological research |url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/media-centre/non-university-press-releases/richard-iii-society-pays-tribute-to-exemplary-archaeological-research |date=15 October 2012 |publisher=University of Leicester |access-date=12 February 2013}}</ref>

== History ==
===Desire for a university===
[[Image:Fielding Johnson Building, University of Leicester.jpg|thumb|The Fielding Johnson Building (built 1837)]]

The first serious suggestions for a university in Leicester began with the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society (founded at a time when "philosophical" broadly meant what "scientific" means today).<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=51}}</ref> With the success of [[Owen's College]] in Manchester, and the establishment of the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1900, and then of [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham University College]], it was thought that Leicester ought to have a university college too. From the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century [[University college#United Kingdom|university colleges]] could not award degrees and had to be associated with universities that had degree-giving powers. Most students at university colleges took examinations set by the [[University of London]].

In the late 19th century the co-presidents of the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society, the Revered James Went, headmaster of the [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston Boys' School]], and J. D. Paul, regularly called for the establishment of a university college<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=58}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leicesterlitandphil.org.uk/history/ |title=History |website=Leicester Lit and Phil Society }}</ref> However, no private donations were forthcoming, and the [[Leicester City Council|Corporation of Leicester]] was busy funding the [[De Montfort University#Origins|School of Art and the Technical School]]. The matter was brought up again by Dr Astley V. Clarke (1870–1945) in 1912. Born in Leicester in 1870, he had been educated at [[Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys|Wyggeston Grammar School]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] before receiving medical training at [[Guy's Hospital]]. He was the new President of the Literary and Philosophy society. Reaction was mixed, with some saying that Leicester's relatively small population would mean a lack of demand. With the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, talk of a university college subsided. In 1917 the ''Leicester Daily Post'' urged in an editorial that something of more practical utility than memorials ought to be created to commemorate the war dead. With the ending of the war both the ''Post'' and its rival the ''Leicester Mail'' encouraged donations to form the university college. Some suggested that Leicester should join forces with Nottingham, Sutton Bonington and Loughborough to create a federal university college of the East Midlands, but nothing came of this proposal.

===Establishment===
The old asylum building had often been suggested as a site for the new university, and after it was due to be finished being used as a hospital for the wounded, Astley Clarke was keen to urge the citizens and local authorities to buy it. Fortunately, Clarke quickly learned the building had already been bought by [[Thomas Fielding Johnson]], a wealthy philanthropist who owned a [[worsted]] manufacturing business. He had bought 37 acres of land for £40,000 and intended not only to house the college, but also the boys' and girls' grammar schools. Further donations soon topped £100,000: many were given in memory of loved ones lost during the war, while others were for those who had taken part and survived. King [[George V]] gave his blessing to the scheme after a visit to the town in 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=69}}</ref>

Talk turned to the curriculum with many arguing that it should focus on Leicester's chief industries hosiery, boots and shoes.  Others had higher hopes than just technical training.   The education acts of [[Education Act 1902|1902]] and [[Education Act 1918|1918]], which brought education to the masses was also thought to have increased the need for a college, not least to train the new teachers that were needed.  Talk of a federal university soured and the decision was for Leicester to become a stand-alone college.  In 1920, the college appointed its first official.  W. G. Gibbs, a long-standing supporter of the college while editor of the ''Leicester Daily Post'', was nominated as Secretary.  On 9 May 1921, Dr R. F. Rattray (1886–1967)<ref>{{harvnb|Burch|1996|p=16}}</ref> was appointed principal, aged 35.  Rattray was an impressive academic.  Having gained a first class English degree at Glasgow, he studied at [[Manchester College, Oxford]].  He then studied in Germany, and secured his PhD at Harvard.  After that, he worked as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister.  Rattray was to teach Latin and English.  He recruited others including Miss Measham to teach Botany, Miss Sarson to teach geography, and Miss Chapuzet to teach French.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=81}}</ref> In all, 14 people started at the university when it opened its doors in October 1921: the principal, the secretary, 3 lecturers and nine students (eight women and one man).  Two types of students were expected, around 100–150 teachers in training, and undergraduates hoping to sit the external degrees of London University.  A students union was formed in 1923–24 with a Miss Bonsor as its first president.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=94}}</ref>

In 1927, after it became University College, Leicester, students sat for the examinations for external degrees of the [[University of London]]. Two years later, it merged with the [[Vaughan College|Vaughan Working Men's College]], which had been providing adult education in Leicester since 1862.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brown|first=Cynthia|year=2012 |title=A Blessing to the Town: 150 Years of Vaughan College, Leicester|publisher=University of Leicester|isbn=9780901507723|page=42}}</ref> In 1931, Dr Rattray resigned as principal.  He was replaced in 1932 by [[Frederick Attenborough]], who was the father of [[David Attenborough|David]] and [[Richard Attenborough|Richard]] Attenborough.  He was succeeded by [[Charles Wilson (political scientist)|Charles Wilson]] in 1952.

===University status to modern day===
[[File:Archaeologist working in Trench.jpg|right|thumb|Archaeologists working on the site of Richard III's grave, in the former Greyfriars Church, in September 2012]]
In 1957, the University College was granted its [[Royal Charter]], and has since then had the status of a university with the right to award its own degrees. The Percy Gee Student Union building was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 9 May 1958.<ref>BBC: How Royal visits have changed https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-17300813</ref>

Leicester University won the first ever series of ''[[University Challenge]]'', in 1963.  The university's motto ''Ut Vitam Habeant'' –"so that they may have life", is a reflection of the war memorial origins of its formation.  It is believed to have been Rattray's suggestion.<ref>{{harvnb|Simmons|1958|p=93}}</ref>

The university medical school, Leicester Medical School, opened in 1971.

In 1994, the University of Leicester celebrated winning the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for its work in Physics & Astronomy.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The prize citation reads: "World-class teaching, research and consultancy programme in astronomy and space and planetary science fields. Practical results from advanced thinking".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalanniversarytrust.org.uk/the-prizes|title=The Prizes|website = The Royal Anniversary Trust}}</ref>

In 2011, the university was selected as one of four sites for national high performance computing (HPC) facilities for theoretical astrophysics and particle physics. An investment of £12.32 million, from the Government's Large Facilities Capital Fund, together with investment from the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] and from universities contribute to a national supercomputer.<ref name="auto">[http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2012/june/multi-million-pound-new-national-supercomputer-to-perform-astronomical-feats], Multi-million pound new national supercomputer to perform astronomical feats. Retrieved 22 March 2015.</ref>

In September 2012, a ULAS team [[Exhumation of Richard III of England|exhumed the body]] of King [[Richard III]], discovering it in the former [[Greyfriars, Leicester|Greyfriars Friary Church]] in the city of [[Leicester]].  As a result of that success Prof King was asked to investigate whether a skeleton found in Jamestown was that of [[George Yeardley]], the 1st colonial governor of Virginia and founder of the [[Virginia General Assembly]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/07/30/richard-iii-expert-called-identify-headless-jamestown-skeleton/|title=Richard III expert to help determine if headless skeleton is colonial governor and 'hero' of Jamestown|author=Sarah Knapton|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 July 2018|access-date=31 July 2018}}</ref>

In January 2017, Physics students from the University of Leicester made national news when they revealed their predictions on how long it would take a zombie apocalypse to wipe out humanity. They calculated that it would take just 100 days for zombies to completely take over earth. At the end of the 100 days, the students predicted that just 300 humans would remain alive and without infection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/01/05/zombie-apocalypse-would-wipe-humankind-just-100-days-according/|title= Zombie apocalypse would wipe out humankind in just 100 days, according to university research|work=The Telegraph|date=5 January 2017|access-date=6 January 2017}}</ref>

In January 2021, around 200 [[University and College Union|UCU]] members at the university passed a no-confidence motion in Vice Chancellor [[Nishan Canagarajah]] because of proposed cuts putting 145 staff members at risk of redundancy. There was anger at his claim that redundancies are needed to "continue to deliver excellence".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Martin|first=Dan|date=26 January 2021|title=UCU members 'overwhelmingly' back no-confidence motion in Leicester University vice-chancellor|work=Leicester Mercury|url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/ucu-members-overwhelmingly-back-no-4931836|url-status=live|access-date=3 February 2021}}</ref> In April, the UCU urged academics to boycott the university due to the planned redundancies, including encouraging people to not apply for jobs at Leicester or collaborate on new research projects.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/union-calls-global-boycott-university-5372857 |title=Union calls for global boycott of University of Leicester as redundancy dispute escalates |newspaper=Leicester Mercury |first=Dan |last=Martin |date=4 May 2021 |accessdate=4 May 2021}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[Image:University of Leicester towers 2010.jpg|thumb|University of Leicester seen from [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] – left to right: the Engineering Building, the Attenborough Tower, the Charles Wilson Building.]]
The main campus is a mile south of the city centre, adjacent to [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] and [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College]]. The skyline of the university is punctuated by three distinctive, towering, buildings from the 1960s: the Department of Engineering, the Attenborough Tower and the Charles Wilson Building.

===Fielding Johnson Building===
The [[Fielding Johnson Building]] was designed by William Parsons in a late Georgian provincial style as the Leicestershire and Rutland County Asylum. From 1921 the building was home to most of the university departments until purpose-built accommodation was created, and it was renamed the Fielding Johnson Building in 1964. It now houses the university's administration offices, the Faculty of Law, faculty of criminology and a lecture theatre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.storyofleicester.info/city-heritage/built-heritage-continued/fielding-johnson-building/ |title=Fielding Johnson Building |last= Milvaques|first=Victoria |date= August 2013|publisher=Leicester City Council |website=Story of Leicester |url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904155226/http://www.storyofleicester.info/city-heritage/built-heritage-continued/fielding-johnson-building/|archive-date = 4 September 2017}}</ref>

===Attenborough Tower===
{{main|Attenborough Tower}}[[Image:Attenborough Tower, Leicester University.jpg|thumb|upright|The Attenborough Tower, home of many of the university's arts departments]]

The 18-storey Attenborough Tower is home to the College of Social Sciences and has undergone extensive renovation.

===Engineering Building===
The Engineering Building was the first major building by British architects [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[James Gowan]]. This Grade II* listed building<ref>{{NHLE|num=1074756|desc=Engineering Building, University of Leicester|access-date=9 July 2019}}</ref> comprises workshops and laboratories at ground level, and a tower containing offices and lecture theatres.

===Other buildings===

Opposite the Fielding Johnson Building are the Astley Clarke Building, home to the School of Economics, and the University Sports Centre.

The Ken Edwards Building, built in 1995, lies adjacent to the Fielding Johnson Building and is home to the School of Management.

Built in 1957, the Percy Gee Building is home to Leicester University's Students' Union. Percy Gee was one of the first treasurers of the University College.

The David Wilson Library was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 4 December 2008, following an extensive refurbishment with a budget of £32 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/about/building/building-the-david-wilson-library/key-facts-and-figures|title = Key Facts and Figures – University of Leicester|access-date =22 September 2014|publisher=University of Leicester}}</ref>

The Bennett Building, Physics and Astronomy Building, the Chemistry Building and the Adrian Building lie beyond the Charles Wilson Building. Across University Road lies the Maurice Shock and Hodgkin Buildings, home to Leicester's Medical School.

The Adrian Building was built in 1967 and designed by Courtald Technical Services which became W.F Johnson & Partners.<ref name= "FRAMEWROKPLAN2008">{{cite web |url=https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/estates/information-for-estates-staff/dfp/downloads/Section15 |title=Building by Building |date=2008 |publisher=University Leicester Framework Plan}}</ref> It was named after [[Edgar Adrian]] the first chancellor of the university (1957–1971).
The Charles Wilson Building was designed by Denys Lasdun and completed in 1967.

Further along University Road and on Salisbury Road and Regents Road are the Department of Education and the Fraser Noble Building.

On Lancaster Road there is the [[Attenborough Arts Centre]], the university's arts centre.

Leicester's halls of residence are noteworthy: many of the halls (nearly all located in [[Oadby]]) date from the early 1900s and were the homes of Leicester's wealthy industrialists.

The University of Leicester is commonly associated with the Attenborough family. [[Richard Attenborough|Richard]] and [[David Attenborough]] (with their younger brother John) spent their childhood in College House, which is now home to part of the Maths department (and is now near to the Attenborough tower, the tallest building on the campus and home to many of the arts and humanities departments). Their father [[Frederick Attenborough]] was Principal of the University College from 1932 until 1951. The brothers were educated at the adjacent [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|grammar school]] before attending the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] respectively.

Both have maintained links with the university—David Attenborough was made an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1970 and opened the Attenborough Arboretum in [[Knighton, Leicestershire|Knighton]] in 1997. In the same year, the ''Richard Attenborough Centre for Disability and the Arts'' was opened by [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Both brothers were made Distinguished Honorary Fellows of the university at the degree ceremony in the afternoon of 13 July 2006.
