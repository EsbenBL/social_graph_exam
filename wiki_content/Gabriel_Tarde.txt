'''Gabriel Tarde''' ({{IPA-fr|taʁd|lang}}; in full '''Jean-Gabriel De Tarde''';<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/583438/Gabriel-Tarde "Gabriel Tarde"]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.</ref> 12 March 1843&nbsp;– 13 May 1904) was a French [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[Criminology|criminologist]] and [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] who conceived sociology as based on small [[psychological]] interactions among individuals (much as if it were [[chemistry]]), the fundamental forces being [[imitation]] and [[innovation]].

==Life==
Tarde was born in [[Sarlat-la-Canéda|Sarlat]] in the province of [[Dordogne]], and he studied law at [[University of Toulouse|Toulouse]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]]. From 1869 to 1894 he worked as a magistrate and investigating judge in the province. In the 1880s he corresponded with representatives of the newly formed criminal anthropology, most notably the Italians [[Enrico Ferri (criminologist)|Enrico Ferri]] and [[Cesare Lombroso]] and the French psychiatrist [[Alexandre Lacassagne]]. With the latter, Tarde came to be the leading representative for a "French school" in criminology.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01568914|title=The Anthem Companion to Gabriel Tarde|first=Marc|last=Renneville|chapter=Gabriel Tarde, the Swallow of French Criminology|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Leroux|date=1 August 2018|publisher=Anthem Press|via=HAL Archives Ouvertes}}</ref> In 1900 he was appointed professor in modern philosophy at the [[Collège de France]]. As such he was the most prominent contemporary critic of Durkheim's sociology.

== Work ==
Among the concepts that Tarde initiated were the [[Collective consciousness|group mind]] (taken up and developed by [[Gustave Le Bon]], and sometimes advanced to explain so-called [[herd behaviour]] or [[crowd psychology]]), and [[economic psychology]], where he anticipated a number of modern developments. Tarde was very critical of [[Émile Durkheim]]'s work at the level of both methodology and theory.<ref>Thomassen, p. 231-249</ref> However, Durkheim's sociology overshadowed Tarde's insights, and it was not until U.S. scholars, such as the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]], took up his theories that they became famous.<ref>Armand Mattelart, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kOduCi83O5QC&dq= ''Invention of Communication''], University of Minnesota Press, 1996, p. 257.</ref>

===Criminology===
Tarde took an interest in criminology and the psychological basis of criminal behavior while working as a [[magistrate]] in public service. He was critical of the concept of the [[atavistic criminal]] as developed by [[Cesare Lombroso]]. Tarde's criminological studies served as the [[underpinning]] of his later sociology.{{Ref|Semeraro-Tarde}}

Tarde also emphasized the tendency of the criminal to return to the scene of the crime and to repeat it, which he saw as part of a wider process of [[repetition compulsion]].<ref>Henri Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970) p. 514</ref>

===Imitation===
Tarde considered imitation, conscious and unconscious, as a fundamental interpersonal trait, with the imitation of fathers by sons as the primal situation, resting on prestige.<ref>Ellenberger, p. 528</ref>

Tarde highlighted the importance of the creative exemplar in society, arguing that "genius is the capacity to engender one's own progeny".<ref>Quoted in Ellenberger, p. 891</ref>

== Science fiction ==
Tarde also wrote a [[science-fiction]] novel entitled ''Underground Man'' (''Fragment d'histoire future'', 1896). The plot is a [[post-apocalyptic]] story of an Earth destroyed by a new Ice Age. Humanity must rebuild a new civilization underground. The choice is made to lay the foundation of their utopia on music and art.

== Influence ==
* [[Sigmund Freud]] built on Tarde's ideas of imitation and suggestion for his work on the theory of the crowd.<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Religion and Society'' (PFL 12) p. 116.</ref>
* [[Everett Rogers]] furthered Tarde's "laws of imitation" in the 1962 book ''[[Diffusion of innovations]]''.
* From the late 1990s and continuing today, Tarde's work has been experiencing a renaissance.<ref>David Toews, "The Renaissance of philosophie Tardienne", in Pli: the Warwick Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 8, 1999.</ref> Spurred by the re-release of his essay ''Monadologie et Sociologie'' by [[Institut Synthelabo]] under the guidance of [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s student {{ill|Eric Alliez|fr}}, Tarde's work is being re-discovered as a harbinger of postmodern French theory, particularly as influenced by the social philosophers Gilles Deleuze and [[Félix Guattari]].

For example, it has recently been revealed that in ''Difference and Repetition'', Deleuze's milestone book which affected his transition to a more socially-aware brand of philosophy and his writing partnership with Guattari, Deleuze in fact re-centered his philosophical orientation around Tarde's thesis that repetition serves difference rather than vice versa.<ref>David Toews (2003) "The New Tarde: Sociology after the End of the Social" Theory Culture & Society Vol. 20 No. 5., 81-98.</ref> Also on the heels of the re-release of Tarde's works has come an important development in which French sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] has referred to Tarde as a possible predecessor to [[Actor-Network Theory]] in part because of Tarde's criticisms of Durkheim's conceptions of the Social.{{Ref|Latour-Social}}

A book, ''The Social after Gabriel Tarde: Debates and Assessments'', edited by Matei Candea, was published by Routledge in 2010. It provides a set of mature critiques of the recent renaissance of Tarde as well as suggesting models for scholars to use Tarde's thought in their scholarship. This book includes contributions that philosophically reflect the [[Bruno Latour|Latour]]ian (including a contribution from Latour himself) as well as Deleuzian approaches to Tarde, and also highlight a number of new ways Tarde is being adapted in terms of methods in contemporary sociology, particularly in the area of [[ethnography]], and the study of online communities. Additionally, in 2010, [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Vincent Antonin Lepinay]] released a short book called ''The Science of Passionate Interests: An Introduction to Gabriel Tarde's Economic Anthropology'', in which they show how Tarde's work offers a strong critique of the foundations of the economics discipline and economic methodology.

Tarde's work has further influenced [[Affect (philosophy)|affect philosophy]]. For example, in 2012 [[Tony D. Sampson|Tony D Sampson]]'s ''book Virality: Contagion Theory in the Age of Networks'' used a Tarde inspired imitation thesis to describe the tendency for emotions, feelings and affects to spread "accidentally" on digital networks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Virality: Contagion Theory in the Age of Networks|last=Sampson|first=Tony D.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8166-7005-5|location=Minneapolis}}</ref>
