He currently is a Professeur invité at [[Sciences Po]] and a Professorial Fellow of [[St Antony's College, Oxford]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/people/paul-collier|title=Paul Collier|website=www.bsg.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> He has served as a senior advisor to the [[Blair Commission for Africa]] and was the Director of the Development Research Group at the [[World Bank]] between 1998 and 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theigc.org/person/paul-collier/|title=Paul Collier|website=IGC|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Collier was born on 23 April 1949.<ref name="The Guardian">{{Citation | title = Birthdays | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | pages = 33 | date = 23 April 2014 }}</ref> Collier’s great-grandfather, Karl Hellenschmidt, was a [[Germans|German]] immigrant to the UK. During World War I, Collier’s grandfather, Karl Hellenschmidt Jr, changed his surname from Hellenschmidt to Collier.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exodus, by Paul Collier|url=https://amp.ft.com/content/ec147ccc-3d57-11e3-b754-00144feab7de|website=Financial Times|date=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Collier|title=Exodus: How Migration is Changing Our World|date=14 April 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-023148-4|page=273}}</ref>

Collier was brought up in [[Sheffield]] where he attended [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)|King Edward VII School]] and studied at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ward |first=Nick |url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/It39s-hats-off-to-a.4326660.jp |title=It's hats off to a master of art! |publisher=The [[Sheffield Star]] |access-date=6 October 2009}}</ref>

==Academic career==
He was a founder of the [[Centre for the Study of African Economies]] and remained its Director from 1989 until 2014. From 1998 until 2003 he was the director of the Development Research Group of the [[World Bank]]. In 2010 and 2011, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine on its [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|list of top global thinkers]].<ref>https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,39#thinker56 December 2011 [[Foreign Policy]]</ref><ref>https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,28</ref> Collier currently serves on the advisory board of [[Academics Stand Against Poverty]] (ASAP).

Collier is a specialist in the political, economic and developmental predicaments of [[Developing country|low-income countries]]<ref name=economist>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9581576 |title=How to help the poorest: Springing the traps |access-date=7 August 2007 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 August 2007}}</ref>  His research covers the causes and consequences of civil war; the effects of aid and the problems of democracy in low-income and natural resources rich societies; urbanization in low-income countries; private investment in African infrastructure and changing organizational cultures.

In 1988 he was awarded the ''Edgar Graham Book Prize'' for the co-written ''Labour and poverty in rural [[Tanzania]]: [[Ujamaa]] and rural development in the United Republic of Tanzania''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=2890|title=IUB Libraries: Edgar Graham Book Prize (African Studies)}}</ref>

''[[The Bottom Billion]]: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It'' ({{ISBN|0-19-531145-0}}), has been compared<ref name=economist /> to [[Jeffrey Sachs]]'s ''[[The End of Poverty]]'' and [[William Easterly]]'s ''The White Man's Burden'', two influential books, which like Collier's book, discuss the pros and cons of [[development aid]] to developing countries.

His 2010 book ''The Plundered Planet''<ref>{{cite journal|title=Empowerment is key|first=Iqbal|last=Quadir|date=1 June 2010|journal=Nature|volume=465|issue=7298|pages=550–551|doi=10.1038/465550a|bibcode=2010Natur.465..550Q|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/16/plundered-planet-paul-collier-book-review|title=The Plundered Planet: How to Reconcile Prosperity with Nature by Paul Collier|author=Alex Renton|work=the Guardian|date=15 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/08/plundered-planet-paul-collier-review | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=The Plundered Planet: How to Reconcile Prosperity with Nature by Paul Collier | first=John | last=Vidal | date=8 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/53359098-7a61-11df-9cd7-00144feabdc0.html|title=The Plundered Planet|work=Financial Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=20 August 2010|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=329|issue=5994 |page=904|doi=10.1126/science.1193025|last1=Low|first1=B. S.|title=Sustainability and Sources of Wealth|bibcode=2010Sci...329..904L|s2cid=154893918}}</ref> is encapsulated in his formulas:
::Nature – Technology + Regulation = Starvation
::Nature + Technology – Regulation = Plunder
::Nature + Technology + Regulation ([[Good governance]]) = Prosperity

The book describes itself as an attempt at a middle way between the [[extremism]] of "Ostriches" ([[denialism]], particularly [[climate change denial]]) and "Environmental Romanticism" (for example, anti-[[genetically modified organisms]] movements in Europe).  The book is about [[sustainable management]] in relation with the geo-[[politics of global warming]], with an attempt to avoid a global [[tragedy of the commons]], with the prime example of [[overfishing]].  In it he builds upon a legacy of the economic psychology of [[greed and fear]], from early [[Utilitarianism]] ([[Jeremy Bentham]]) to more recently the [[Stern Review]].

==Honours==
Collier was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2008 Birthday Honours]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=58729 |date=14 June 2008 |page=7 |supp=y}}</ref> and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 2014 [[New Year Honours]] for services to promoting research and policy change in Africa.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=60728 |supp=y|page=1|date=31 December 2013}}</ref>

In November 2014, Collier was awarded the [[President's Medal (British Academy)|President's Medal]] by the [[British Academy]], for "his pioneering contribution in bringing ideas from research in to policy within the field of African economics."<ref>{{cite web|title=British Academy President's Medal awarded to Paul Collier|url=https://www.socsci.ox.ac.uk/news/british-academy-president2019s-medal-awarded-to-paul-collier|website=Social Sciences Division|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=23 July 2017|date=28 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915081706/https://www.socsci.ox.ac.uk/news/british-academy-president2019s-medal-awarded-to-paul-collier|archive-date=15 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In July 2017, Collier was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elections to the British Academy celebrate the diversity of UK research|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/elections-british-academy-celebrate-diversity-uk-research|website=British Academy|access-date=29 July 2017|date=2 July 2017}}</ref>
