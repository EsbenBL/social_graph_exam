'''Paul David Klemperer''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 15 August 1956)<ref>[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U23290 KLEMPERER, Prof. Paul David’], ''Who's Who 2014'', A & C Black, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014</ref> is an economist and the [[Edgeworth Professor of Economics]] at the [[ Department of Economics, University of Oxford|Department of Economics]], [[Oxford University]]. He is a member of the [[Klemperer|Klemperer family]]. He works on industrial economics, competition policy, [[auction]] theory, and [[economics of climate change|climate change economics]] and policy.

Having lived his early life in [[the Midlands]] where he attended the independent [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]],<ref>[https://www.oldeds.kes.org.uk/academics.html], ''Old Edwardians Website: Academics'' Retrieved 27 November 2021</ref> Klemperer went on to gain an engineering degree from [[Cambridge University]], and an [[MBA]] and an economics PhD from [[Stanford University]]. He was elected John Thomson Fellow and tutor of [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]] in 1984, and a professorial fellow of [[Nuffield College, Oxford]] in 1995, when he became [[Edgeworth Professor of Economics]] in succession to Nobel Prize winner [[James Mirrlees]].

He was a member of the UK [[Competition Commission]] from 2001–5. He was elected a fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] in 1994, a fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1999, and a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005. He is also a fellow of the [[European Economic Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fellows {{!}} EEA|url=https://www.eeassoc.org/fellows|access-date=2021-03-23|website=www.eeassoc.org}}</ref>

== Academic contributions ==

His 1985 papers (with Jeremy Bulow and John Geanakoplos) developed the concept – and invented the terminology&nbsp;– of "[[strategic complements]]" that is now commonly used in game theory, industrial organisation and elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/klemperer/multimarket.PDF Multimarket Oligopoly, JPE]</ref>

His PhD thesis, and independent work by Carl Christian von Weizsacker, began the study of consumer [[switching costs]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1885068?uid=3738296&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101520514723 Switching Costs, QJE]</ref>

His paper on supply function equilibria (with Margaret Meyer) developed a standard model for the analysis of privatised electricity markets, and has been important in developing the theory of multiunit auctions.<ref>[http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/klemperer/supply.pdf Supply Functions, Econometrica]</ref>

His papers (many of which are co-authored with Jeremy Bulow) apply ideas from auction theory to other economic contexts, including finance and political economy.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2138791?uid=3738296&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101520514723 Rational Frenzies and Crashes, JPE]</ref><ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/116984?uid=3738296&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101520514723 War of Attrition, AER]</ref><ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2118262?uid=3738296&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101520514723 Auctions versus negotiations, AER]</ref>

He has also invented new auction designs, including the "Product Mix Auction" that is now in regular use by the Bank of England (currently used monthly).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.tb00523.x | volume=8 | issue=2–3 | year=2010 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=526–536 | last1 = Klemperer | first1 = Paul| title=The Product-Mix Auction: A New Auction Design for Differentiated Goods }}</ref> This new auction for differentiated products has similarities to a simultaneous multiple-round auction, but runs instantaneously, is said to be more robust against collusion, and allows sellers, as well as buyers, to specify how the quantities they trade will depend on the auction prices. His other innovations include the Anglo-Dutch auction,<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/S0014-2921(97)00123-2 | volume=42 | issue=3–5 | title=Auctions with almost common values: The 'Wallet Game' and its applications | year=1998 | journal=European Economic Review | pages=757–769 | last1 = Klemperer | first1 = Paul| url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/economics/papers/1998/w3/wallwebb.pdf }}</ref> and (with Aytek Erdil) Reference-Rule Pricing for package auctions.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.tb00524.x | volume=8 | issue=2–3 | year=2010 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=537–547 | last1 = Erdil | first1 = Aytek| title=A New Payment Rule for Core-Selecting Package Auctions | citeseerx=10.1.1.151.313 | s2cid=1469564 }}</ref>

He has also worked (with Elizabeth Baldwin) on applying [[tropical geometry]] to economics and auctions, including the Product Mix auction.

== Public policy ==

He was principal auction-theorist designing the UK '[[3G]]' mobile-phone license auction that raised £22½ billion in spring 2000 and was far more successful than several parallel exercises on the [[European continent]]. The Netherland auction that took place 3 months later raised 1/4 of the revenue per head of population, and the difference has been attributed to the auction design.<ref>[http://ikt.web.etu.edu.tr/RePEc/pdf/1002.pdf Madden, Saglam and Morey "Auction Design and the Success of National 3G Spectrum Auctions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708233133/http://ikt.web.etu.edu.tr/RePEc/pdf/1002.pdf |date=8 July 2011 }}</ref> It has been argued that the [[UK Treasury]] owes £15 billion or more to him and [[Ken Binmore]], who led the auction team.

In 2002, he advised the [[UK government]] on the world's first auction for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, working with Nobel prizewinner [[Eric Maskin]].

In 2007–2008, he advised the UK and US governments on the financial crisis, and he developed a new form of auction (the Product Mix auction) to help the [[Bank of England]] alleviate the liquidity crisis.<ref>[http://regulation2point0.org/2010/08/auction-magic/ Auction Magic, Regulation2point0]</ref> The Bank Governor, Sir Mervyn King, told the Economist that "The Bank of England's use of Klemperer auctions in our liquidity insurance operations is a marvellous application of theoretical economics to a practical problem of vital importance to financial markets."<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/10/microeconomics A golden age of micro. The Economist, October 19th 2012]</ref> He subsequently advised other countries' Central Banks.

He advised the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] 1999–2001, was a member of the UK [[Competition Commission]] from 2001–5, and remains on its Panel of Economic Advisors.

He participated in the meeting that drafted the Potsdam Memorandum to the 2007 UN Climate Change Conference in [[Bali]];<ref>[http://www.voxeu.org/article/climate-change-innovation-key What is the top priority on climate change?, VoxEU]</ref> he is on the Environmental Economics Academic Panel to the UK's Department of the Environment (Defra).
