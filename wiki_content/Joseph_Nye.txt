'''Joseph Samuel Nye Jr.''' (born January 19, 1937) is an American [[political scientist]]. He is the co-founder, along with [[Robert Keohane]], of the [[international relations]] theory of [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], developed in their 1977 book ''Power and Interdependence''. Together with Keohane, he developed the concepts of asymmetrical and [[complex interdependence]]. They also explored transnational relations and [[Global politics|world politics]] in an edited volume in the 1970s. More recently, he explained the distinction between hard power and soft power, and pioneered the theory of [[soft power]]. His notion of "smart power" ("the ability to combine hard and soft power into a successful strategy") became popular with the use of this phrase by members of the [[Clinton Administration]], and more recently the [[Obama Administration]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nye|first=Joseph|date=November 29, 2007|title=Smart Power|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/smart-power_b_74725|url-status=live|website=The Huffington Post}}</ref> He is the former Dean of the [[John F.
