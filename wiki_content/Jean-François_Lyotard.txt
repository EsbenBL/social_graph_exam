==Biography==

=== Early life, educational background, and family ===

Jean François Lyotard was born on August 10, 1924 in [[Vincennes]], France to Jean-Pierre Lyotard, a sales representative, and Madeleine Cavalli. He went to school at the [[Lycée Buffon]] (1935–42) and [[Louis-le-Grand]], Paris.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bamford, Kiff |title=Jean-François Lyotard |publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-1-78023-808-1|location=London |pages=21|oclc=966253014}}</ref> As a child, Lyotard had many aspirations: to be an artist, a historian, a Dominican friar, and a writer. He later gave up the dream of becoming a writer when he finished writing an unsuccessful fictional novel at the age of 15.<ref name="Sica, Alan 2005">Sica, Alan. 2005, "Jean Francois Lyotard."

Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 211–213.</ref>

===Political life===

In 1954, Lyotard became a member of ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' ("Socialism or Barbarism"), a French political organisation formed in 1948 around the inadequacy of the [[Trotskyist]] analysis to explain the new forms of domination in the [[Soviet Union]]. ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' and the publication of the same name had an objective to conduct a [[critique of Marxism]] from within the left, including the dominance of bureaucrary within the French Communist Party and its adherence to the dictats of the Soviet Union. His writings in this period are mostly concerned with [[Far-left politics#Ultra-leftism|far-left politics]], with a focus on the Algerian situation—which he witnessed first-hand while teaching philosophy in Constantine.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lyotard |first= Jean-François |chapter=The Name of Algeria|title=Political Writings | publisher=UCL Press | year=1993 | pages=165–170}}</ref> As the principle correspondent on Algeria for ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'', during the period of Algeria's struggle for independence, Lyotard wrote a dozen essays analysing the economic and political situation (1956–63), which were later  reproduced in ''La Guerre des Algeriens'' (1989) and translated in ''Political Writings'' (1993).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lyotard, Jean-François |title=La guerre des Algériens: écrits, 1956-1963 |date=1989|publisher=Galilée |author2=Ramdani, Mohammed |isbn=2-7186-0353-4|location=Paris|oclc=21409668}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Lyotard, Jean François |title=Political writings|date=1993|publisher=UCL Press |isbn=0-203-49922-0|location=London|oclc=51443880}}</ref> Lyotard hoped to encourage an Algerian fight for independence from France, and a [[social revolution]], actively supporting the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] in secret, whilst also being critical of its approach.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lyotard, Jean-François |title=Jean-François Lyotard: the interviews and debates|publisher=Bloomsbury|editor=Bamford, Kiff |year=2020|isbn=978-1-350-08134-5|location=London|pages=129–135|oclc=1152059668}}</ref> Following disputes with [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] in 1964, Lyotard left ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' for the newly formed [[splinter group]] ''Pouvoir Ouvrier'' ("Worker Power"), from which he resigned in turn in 1966.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Lefort |first= Claude |author-link=Claude Lefort |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1977 | issue=30|pages=177}} Cf. http://www.iep.utm.edu/lyotard/.</ref> Although Lyotard played an active part in the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] uprisings, he distanced himself from [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary Marxism]] with his 1974 book ''[[Libidinal Economy]]''.<ref>Geoffrey Bennington, ''Lyotard: Writing the Event'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988, p. 1.</ref> He distanced himself from Marxism because he felt that Marxism had a rigid [[Structuralism|structuralist]] approach and they were imposing "systematization of desires" through strong emphasis on industrial production as the ground culture.<ref>Mann, Doug.

===Academic career===
Lyotard taught at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée d'Aumale|fr|3=Lycée d'Aumale (Constantine)|lt=Lycée of Constantine}}, Algeria<ref name="Schrift p. 161"/> from 1950 to 1952. In 1952 Lyotard returned to mainland France to teach at the Prytanée military academy, La Flèche, Sarthe. He published the book ''La phénoménologie'' (''Phenomenology'') in 1954 and began to write for the journal ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' under the psudonym François Laborde.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lyotard, Jean-François |title=Phenomenology|date=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0-7914-0805-1|location=Albany|oclc=22596856}}</ref> In 1972, Lyotard began teaching at the [[University of Paris VIII]]; he taught there until 1987 when he became Professor Emeritus. In 1982-3 Lyotard was involved in the foundation of the [[Collège International de Philosophie]], Paris, serving as its second Director in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jean-François LYOTARD {{!}} CIPh Paris|url=https://ciph.org/spip.php?page=quisommesnousdetail&id_personne=1110|access-date=2020-12-27|website=ciph.org}}</ref> Lyotard frequently lectured outside France as visiting professor at universities around the world. From 1974, these included trans-atlantic visits, including: [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Yale University]], [[Stony Brook University]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]] in the U.S., the [[Université de Montréal]] in [[Quebec]] (Canada), and the [[University of São Paulo]] in Brazil. In 1987 he took a part-time professorship at the [[University of California, Irvine]] where he held a joint post with [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Wolfgang Iser]] in the Department of Critical Theory.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Peeters|first=Benoît|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795757034|title=Derrida : a biography|date=2013|publisher=Polity Press|others=Brown, Andrew (Literary translator)|isbn=978-0-7456-5615-1|edition=English|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=454–5|oclc=795757034}}</ref>  Before his death, he split his time between Paris and Atlanta, where he taught at [[Emory University]] as the Woodruff Professor of Philosophy and French from 1995-8.

==Work==

Lyotard's work is characterised by a persistent opposition to [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], métarécits ([[meta-narrative]]s), and generality. He is fiercely critical of many of the "universalist" claims of [[the Enlightenment]], and several of his works serve to undermine the fundamental principles that generate these broad claims.

In his writings of the early 1970s, he [[Social rejection|rejects]] what he regards as theological underpinnings of both [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]: "In Freud, it is judaical,<!--[sic]--> critical sombre (forgetful of the political); in Marx it is catholic.<!--[sic]--> [[Hegelian]], reconciliatory (...) in the one and in the other the relationship of the economic with meaning is blocked in the category of representation (...) Here a politics, there a therapeutics, in both cases a laical theology, on top of the arbitrariness and the roaming of forces".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Lyotard |first=Jean-François |title=Adorno as the Devil | journal=Telos | year=1974 | issue=19|pages=134–5}}</ref> Consequently, he rejected [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s negative [[dialectics]] because he viewed them as seeking a "therapeutic resolution in the framework of a religion, here the religion of history."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Lyotard |first=Jean-François |title=Adorno as the Devil | journal=Telos | year=1974 | issue=19|pages=126}}</ref> In Lyotard's "libidinal economics" he aimed at "discovering and describing different social modes of investment of libidinal intensities".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Hurley |first=Robert |title=Introduction to Lyotard | journal=Telos | year=1974 |volume=1974 | issue=19|pages=124–126|doi=10.3817/0374019124 |s2cid=147017209 }}</ref>

=== Academic legacy ===
Throughout his academic career Jean-François Lyotard has contributed to the magazines ''L'Âge nouveau'', ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie|Socialisme ou barbarie]]'', ''Cahiers de philosophie'', ''Esprit'', ''Revue d'esthétique'', ''Musique en jeu'', ''L'Art vivant'', ''[[Semiotext(e)|Semiotexte]]'', ''October'', ''Art Press International'', ''Critique'', ''Flash Art'', ''Art Forum'', ''Po&sie,'' among others.

===''The Postmodern Condition''===
Lyotard is a skeptic for modern cultural thought. According to his 1979 ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'', the impact of the postmodern condition was to provoke [[skepticism]] about universalizing theories. Lyotard argues that we have outgrown our needs for [[metanarratives]] ({{lang-fr|métarécits}}) due to the advancement of techniques and technologies since [[World War II]]. He argues against the possibility of justifying the narratives that bring together disciplines and social practices, such as science and culture; according to James Williams, for Lyotard "the narratives we tell to justify a single set of laws and stakes are inherently unjust."<ref name=Williams>Williams, James. 2002. "Jean-Francois Lyotard", pp. 210–214, in ''Key Contemporary Social Theorists'' by Anthony Elliott and Larry Ray. Oxford, Blackwell Publishers.</ref> A [[faith|loss of faith]] in metanarratives has an effect on how we view science, art, and literature. Little narratives have now become the appropriate way for explaining [[social transformation]]s and [[Social conflict|political problems]]. Lyotard argues that this is the driving force behind postmodern science. As metanarratives fade, science suffers a loss of faith in its search for [[truth]], and therefore must find other ways of legitimating its efforts. Connected to this scientific legitimacy is the growing dominance for [[computer|information machines]]. Lyotard argues that one day, in order for knowledge to be considered useful, it will have to be converted into [[Data (computing)|computerized data]]. Years later, this led him into writing his book ''The Inhuman'', published in 1988, in which he illustrates a world where technology has taken over.<ref>Parker, Noel, and Stuart Sim. 1997. "Lyotard, Jean Francois (1924–)", pp. 205–208, in ''The A-Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists'', Prentice Hall/Harvester Wheatsheaf.</ref>

=== ''The Inhuman'' (1988) ===
In his book, ''The Inhuman'', Lyotard explores the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]], and [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], as well as the works of modernist and postmodernist artists like [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], and [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], in a wide-ranging debate. Time and memory, the sublime and the avant-garde, and the link between aesthetics and politics are all topics Lyotard addresses in the book. He analyzes the close but problematic ties between modernity, development, and humanity, as well as the shift to postmodernity, throughout his study. The job of literature, philosophy, and the arts, according to Lyotard, is to give witness to and explain this arduous shift.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-François|title=The Inhuman|publisher=Polity Press|year=1992 |origyear=originally published 1988|isbn=9780804720083}}</ref>

Lyotard rejected classical humanism mainly because he paradoxically assumes that the humane is something that every person has inherently from birth but can only be realized through an education. Lyotard essentially asks if humanity is so inherent to all of us, can we only gain it by undergoing education? By using the concept of the inhuman, Lyotard described all those things that humanism has excluded from its definition of man.

He developed a [[Science-Fiction|science fiction]] thought experiment that would take place in 4.5 billion years, at the time of the explosion of the sun. Should the human species put itself in the position to live on without Earth, and if so what would then remain of "humanity"? Everything that is of importance for our present determination of what is "human" would fall away if the human species began living an extra-planetary existence. Lyotard's opinion on this remained divided: on the one hand, he criticized the dehumanizing effects of modern technology that can already be observed today; on the other hand, he saw in them the chance to open up a space of possibilities, since they do not fix the human being to one image.

===The collapse of the "grand narrative" and "language-games"===

Most famously, in ''[[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge)]]'' (1979), he proposes what he calls an extreme simplification of the "postmodern" as an 'incredulity towards meta-narratives'.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lyotard |first= Jean-François |title=La Condition Postmoderne: Rapport sur le Savoir | publisher=Les Editions de Minuit | year=1979 | pages=7}}</ref> These meta-narratives—sometimes 'grand narratives'—are grand, large-scale theories and philosophies of the world, such as the [[Progress (history)|progress of history]], the [[Knowledge#Scientific knowledge|knowability of everything by science]], and the possibility of [[Nirvana|absolute freedom]]. Lyotard argues that we have ceased to believe that narratives of this kind are adequate to represent and contain us all. He points out that [[Consensus reality|no one seemed to agree on what, if anything, was real]] and everyone had their own perspective and story.<ref>Lemert, Charles C.. "After Modern." Social theory: the multicultural and classic readings.1993. Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 456.</ref> We have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of our aspirations, beliefs and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives.<ref>[http://athome.harvard.edu/programs/nagy/threads/micronarratives.html Micronarratives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164313/http://athome.harvard.edu/programs/nagy/threads/micronarratives.html |date=2011-06-29 }}</ref> For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of "[[language-games]]" found in the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.<ref>Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. "Jean Francois Lyotard." Key contemporary social theorists. 2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 211.</ref>

In Lyotard's works, the term "language games", sometimes also called "phrase regimens", denotes the [[Multiculturalism|multiplicity of communities]] of meaning, the innumerable and incommensurable separate systems in which meanings are produced and rules for their circulation are created.<ref>Lyotard, Jean-François (1984). ''The Postmodern Condition.'' Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], Print. pp. 66–67.</ref> This involves, for example, an incredulity towards the metanarrative of [[human emancipation]]. That is, the story of how the human race has set itself free that brings together the language game of science, the language game of human historical conflicts and the language game of human qualities into the overall justification of the steady development of the human race in terms of wealth and moral [[well-being]]. According to this metanarrative, the justification of science is related to wealth and education. The development of history is seen as a steady [[Progress (history)#Types|progress towards civilization or moral well-being]]. The language game of human passions, qualities and [[Vice#Etymology|faults]] (c.f. [[Character flaw|character flaws (narratives)]]), is seen as steadily shifting in favor of our qualities and away from our faults as science and historical developments help us [[Positive psychology#Character Strengths and Virtues|to conquer our faults in favor of our qualities]]. The point is that any event ought to be able to be understood in terms of the justifications of this metanarrative; anything that happens can be understood and judged according to the discourse of human emancipation. For example, for any new social, political or scientific revolution we could ask the question, "Is this revolution a step towards the greater [[well-being]] of [[Mass society|the mass of human beings]]?" It should always be possible to answer this question in terms of the rules of justification of the metanarrative of human emancipation.<ref>Williams, James (1998). ''Lyotard: Toward a Postmodern Philosophy.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Inc, Print. pp. 32–33.</ref>

This becomes more crucial in ''Au juste: Conversations (Just Gaming)'' (1979) and ''Le Différend ([[The Differend]])'' (1983), which develop a postmodern theory of justice. It might appear that the atomisation of human beings implied by the notion of the micronarrative and the language game suggests a collapse of ethics. It has often been thought that universality is a condition for something to be a properly ethical statement: "thou shalt not steal" is an ethical statement in a way that "thou shalt not steal from Margaret" is not. The latter is too particular to be an ethical statement (what's so special about Margaret?); it is only ethical if it rests on a universal statement ("thou shalt not steal from anyone"). But universals are impermissible in a world that has lost faith in metanarratives, and so it would seem that ethics is impossible. Justice and injustice can only be terms within language games, and the universality of ethics is out of the window. Lyotard argues that notions of justice and injustice do in fact remain in postmodernism. The new definition of injustice is indeed to use the language rules from one "phrase regimen" and apply them to another. Ethical behaviour is about remaining alert precisely to the threat of this injustice, about paying attention to things in their particularity and not enclosing them within abstract conceptuality. One must bear witness to the "differend". In a differend, there is a conflict between two parties that cannot be solved in a just manner. However, the act of being able to bridge the two and understand the claims of both parties, is the first step towards finding a solution.

<blockquote>"I would like to call a differend the case where the plaintiff is divested of the means to argue and becomes for that reason a victim. If the addressor, the addressee, and the sense of the testimony are neutralized, everything takes place as if there were no damages. A case of differend between two parties takes place when the regulation of the conflict that opposes them is done in the idiom of one of the parties while the wrong suffered by the other is not signified in that idiom."<ref>{{cite book |last= Lyotard |first= Jean-François |title= The Differend: Phrases in Dispute |url= https://archive.org/details/differendphrases0000lyot |url-access= registration | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | year=1988 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/differendphrases0000lyot/page/9 9] |isbn= 0-8166-1610-8}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In more than one book, Lyotard promoted what he called a new [[paganism]]. &nbsp;[[Plato]], in Book II of the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', condemns pagans for their shape-shifting and deceitful gods, antithetical to universal truth.  Lyotard prefers a mirror image of Plato's critique, vindicating the pagans as Plato sees them.  A new paganism would revolt against Greek masculinism such as that of Plato. The revolt would be led by women, for woman is antirational and antiphilosophical (at least as Plato understands what it is to be philosophical).  Woman, as "the little girl", is "the antonym of the adult male questioner" and would release us from the mental illness evident in Platonic philosophy, in Judaism and in the American, French and Russian revolutions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsUJPyH_z-sC&pg=PA29|last=Pangle|first=Thomas L.|title=The Ennobling of Democracy: The Challenge of the Postmodern Age|location=Baltimore|publisher=Johns Hopkins U.P.|year=1992|isbn=0-8018-4262-X|pages=29–31}}</ref>

===''The Differend''===

In ''[[The Differend]]'', based on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on the separation of Understanding, Judgment, and Reason, Lyotard identifies the moment in which language fails as the differend, and explains it as follows: "...the unstable state and instant of language wherein something which must be able to be put into phrases cannot yet be… the human beings who thought they could use language as an instrument of communication, learn through the feeling of pain which accompanies silence (and of pleasure which accompanies the invention of a new idiom)".<ref>Lyotard, Jean-François (1988). ''The Differend: Phrases in Dispute.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, Print. p. 13.</ref> Lyotard undermines the common view that the meanings of phrases can be determined by what they refer to (the referent). The meaning of a phrase—an event (something happens)--cannot be fixed by appealing to reality (what actually happened). Lyotard develops this view of language by defining "reality" in an original way, as a complex of possible senses attached to a referent through a name. The correct sense of a phrase cannot be determined by a reference to reality, since the referent itself does not fix sense, and reality itself is defined as the complex of competing senses attached to a referent. Therefore, the phrase event remains indeterminate.

Lyotard uses the example of [[Auschwitz]] and the revisionist historian [[Robert Faurisson]]’s demands for proof of the Holocaust to show how the differend operates as a [[double bind]]. Faurisson will only accept proof of the existence of gas chambers from eyewitnesses who were themselves victims of the gas chambers. However, any such eyewitnesses are dead and are not able to testify. Either there were no gas chambers, in which case there would be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, or there were gas chambers, in which case there would still be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, because they would be dead. Since Faurisson will accept no evidence for the existence of gas chambers, except the testimony of actual victims, he will conclude from both possibilities (gas chambers existed and gas chambers did not exist) that gas chambers did not exist. This presents a double bind. There are two alternatives, either there were gas chambers or there were not, which lead to the same conclusion: there were no gas chambers (and no final solution).<ref>Lyotard, Jean-François (1988). ''The Differend: Phrases in Dispute.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, Print. pp. 16–17.</ref> The case is a differend because the harm done to the victims cannot be presented in the standard of judgement upheld by Faurisson.

===The sublime===
Lyotard was a frequent writer on [[aesthetic]] matters. He was, despite his reputation as a postmodernist, a great promoter of [[modernist art]]. Lyotard saw [[postmodernism]] as a latent tendency within thought throughout time and not a narrowly limited historical period. He favoured the startling and perplexing works of the high modernist avant-garde. In them he found a demonstration of the limits of our conceptuality, a valuable lesson for anyone too imbued with Enlightenment confidence. Lyotard has written extensively also on many contemporary artists of his choice: [[Valerio Adami]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jacques Monory]], [[Ruth Francken]], [[Shusaku Arakawa]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Karel Appel]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[René Guiffrey]], {{ill|Gianfranco Baruchello|fr}}, and [[Albert Ayme]] as well as on earlier artists, notably [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Paul Klee]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lyotard |first1=Jean-Francois |title=Writings on Contemporary Art and Artists |date=2009–2013 |publisher=Leuven University Press |isbn=9789058678867 |edition=7 volumes}}</ref>

He developed these themes in particular by discussing the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The "sublime" is a term in aesthetics whose fortunes revived under postmodernism after a century or more of neglect. It refers to the experience of pleasurable anxiety that we experience when confronting wild and threatening sights like, for example, a massive craggy mountain, black against the sky, looming terrifyingly in our vision. A sublime is the conjunction of two opposed feelings, which makes it harder for us to see the injustice of it, or a solution to it.

Lyotard found particularly interesting the explanation of the sublime offered by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (''Kritik der Urtheilskraft'', more exactly ''Critique of the Power of Judgment''). In this book, Kant explains this mixture of anxiety and pleasure in the following terms: there are two kinds of "sublime" experience. In the "mathematically" sublime, an object strikes the mind in such a way that we find ourselves unable to take it in as a whole. More precisely, we experience a clash between our reason (which tells us that all objects are finite) and the imagination (the aspect of the mind that organizes what we see, and which sees an object incalculably larger than ourselves, and feels infinite). In the "dynamically" sublime, the mind recoils at an object so immeasurably more powerful than we, whose weight, force, scale could crush us without the remotest hope of our being able to resist it. (Kant stresses that if we are in ''actual'' danger, our feeling of anxiety is very different from that of a sublime feeling. The sublime is an aesthetic experience, not a practical feeling of personal danger.) This explains the feeling of anxiety.

What is deeply unsettling about the mathematically sublime is that the mental faculties that present visual perceptions to the mind are inadequate to the concept corresponding to it; in other words, what we are able to make ourselves see cannot fully match up to what we know is there. We know it is a mountain but we cannot take the whole thing into our perception. Our sensibility is incapable of coping with such sights, but our reason can assert the finitude of the presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} With the dynamically sublime, our sense of physical danger should prompt an awareness that we are not just physical material beings, but moral and (in Kant's terms) [[noumenal]] beings as well. The body may be dwarfed by its power but our reason need not be. This explains, in both cases, why the sublime is an experience of pleasure as well as pain.

Lyotard is fascinated by this admission, from one of the philosophical architects of the Enlightenment, that the mind cannot always organise the world rationally. Some objects are simply incapable of being brought neatly under concepts. For Lyotard, in ''[[Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime]]'', but drawing on his argument in ''The Differend'', this is a good thing. Such generalities as "concepts" fail to pay proper attention to the particularity of things. What happens in the sublime is a crisis where we realise the inadequacy of the imagination and reason to each other. What we are witnessing, says Lyotard, is actually the differend; the straining of the mind at the edges of itself and at the edges of its conceptuality.

==== Aesthetics ====
Lyotard's thesis, published under the title [[Discourse, Figure|''Discours, Figure'' (1971)]], focused on [[aesthetics]]. Lyotard devoted himself a lot to aesthetic issues, in a way that sought to break with the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] perspective, in which art had to think of itself as a materialization of the mind.

Lyotard's thought on [[Modern art|modern and contemporary art]] focused on a few artists who allowed him to emphasize the flagship issues of French thought after the Second World War, particularly those of conceptual mastery of the artist as an author: [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] as well as [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], Albert Ayme, [[Daniel Buren]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Valerio Adami]], [[Jacques Monory]], [[Shusaku Arakawa]], [[Ruth Francken]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Barnett Newman]], Joseph Kosuth, [[Karel Appel]], René Guiffrey, and Gianfranco Baruchello.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-François|title=Textes dispersés = Miscellaneous texts|publisher=[[Leuven University Press]]|year=2012|isbn=9789058677914}}</ref>

===''Libidinal Economy''===

In one of Lyotard's most famous books, ''[[Libidinal Economy]]'', he offers a critique of Marx’s idea of "false consciousness" and claims that the 19th-century working class enjoyed being a part of the industrialization process. Lyotard claims that this was due to libidinal energy{{mdash}}the term "libidinal" coming from the term ''[[libido]]'', used in psychoanalysis to refer to the desires of our deeper consciousness. ''Libidinal Economy'' has been called an achievement in our attempts to live with the rejection of all religious and moral principles through an undermining of the structures associated with it.<ref>Lemert, Charles. 2013. "The Idea of the Postmodern" Pp. 465–468 in Social Theory: The Multicultural, Global, and Classic Readings, Westview Press. Boulder, CO.</ref> Structures conceal libidinal intensities while intense feelings and desires force us away from set structures. However, there also can be no intensities or desires without structures, because there would be no dream of escaping the repressive structures if they do not exist. "Libidinal energy comes from this disruptive intervention of external events within structures that seek order and self-containment."<ref name=Williams/> This was the first of Lyotard's writings that had really criticized a Marxist view. It achieved great success, but was also the last of Lyotard's writings on this particular topic where he really opposed the views of [[Karl Marx|Marx]].

===''Les Immatériaux''===
In 1985, Lyotard co-curated the exhibition ''Les Immatériaux'' at the Centre de Création Industrielle at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, together with the design theorist and curator [[Thierry Chaput]].<ref>{{cite book |title=30 Years after Les Immatériaux: Art, Science, and Theory |editor1-last=Hui |editor1-first=Yuk |editor2-last=Broeckmann |editor2-first=Andreas |date=2015 |publisher=Meson Press |location=Lüneburg |page=9 |url=https://meson.press/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/9783957960313-30-Years-Les-Immateriaux.pdf |access-date=12 February 2019}}</ref> At that point, ''Les Immatériaux'' was the largest exhibition held at the Centre Georges Pompidou. The exhibition was framed in a pre-1989 context that predicted globalization to be a melancholy foreshadowing of contemporary art's shifting function in the era of increasing transnational exchange, and as a turning point in a history of exhibits in the aftermath of what was formerly known as aesthetics. <ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Rajchman|first=John|title=Les Immatériaux or How to Construct the History of Exhibitions: Landmark Exhibitions Issue – Tate Papers|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/12/les-immateriaux-or-how-to-construct-the-history-of-exhibitions|access-date=2021-10-14|website=Tate|language=en-GB}}</ref>

John Rajchman says this about the exhibition: "We might imagine Les Immatériaux as an extravagant staging of a peculiar moment in the role of information in the history of aesthetics after so-called ‘modernism’, yet before the ‘contemporary’ configuration of biennials that was already taking shape in the 1990s, within or against which the question of a new ‘history of exhibition’ now itself arises."<ref name=":0" />

==="Mainmise"===
Lyotard was impressed by the importance of childhood in human life,<ref>J-F Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Explained to Children'' (London, 1992) p. 112</ref> which he saw as providing the opportunity of creativity, as opposed to the settled [[hubris]] of maturity.<ref name="Rereading Jean-Francois Lyotard 2016 p 142">Shields, R. (ed.), ''Rereading Jean-Francois Lyotard'' (2016), p. 142.</ref>  In "Mainmise",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-François|date=1992|title=Mainmise|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/philtoday/content/philtoday_1992_0036_0004_0419_0427|journal=Philosophy Today|volume=36|issue=4|pages=419–427|doi=10.5840/philtoday199236411}}</ref> however, he also explored the hold of childhood experience on the individual through the (Roman) concept of [[wikt:mancipium|mancipium]], an authoritative right of possession.<ref name="Rereading Jean-Francois Lyotard 2016 p 142"/> Because parental influences affect the new-born before it has the linguistic skill even to articulate them, let alone oppose them, Lyotard considered that "We are born from others but also to others, given over defenceless to them. Subject to their ''mancipium''."<ref>Quoted in Still, K. (ed.), ''Minima Memoria'' (Stanford, 2007), p. 202.</ref>

==Later life and death==

Some of the latest works that Lyotard had been working on were both writings about a French writer, activist, and politician, [[André Malraux]]. One of them being a biography, ''Signed, Malraux''. Lyotard was interested in the aesthetic views of society that Malraux shared. Lyotard's other book was named ''The Confession of Augustine'' and was a study in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of time. This work-in-progress was published posthumously in the same year of Lyotard's death.

Lyotard repeatedly returned to the notion of the Postmodern in essays gathered in English as ''The Postmodern Explained to Children'', ''Toward the Postmodern'', and ''Postmodern Fables''. In 1998, while preparing for a conference on [[postmodernism]] and [[media theory]], he died unexpectedly from a case of [[leukemia]] that had advanced rapidly. He is buried in Division 6 of [[Le Père Lachaise Cemetery|Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tomb of Jean-François Lyotard|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Grave_of_Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Lyotard|access-date=2017-11-05}}</ref>

==Criticism==

There are three major criticisms of Lyotard's work. Each coincides with a school of thought. [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] have written [[deconstruction]]s of Lyotard's work (Derrida 1992; Nancy 1985).<ref>Derrida, Jacques. 2005. ''On Touching, Jean-Luc-Nancy'', Stanford University Press.</ref> They focus on Lyotard's postmodern work and on ''The Differend'' in particular. A differend depends upon a distinction drawn between groups that itself depends upon the heterogeneity of [[language game]]s and genres of discourse. Why should these differences be privileged over an endless division and reconstruction of groups? In concentrating on specific differences, Lyotard's thought becomes overly dependent on differences; between categories that are given as fixed and well defined. From the point of view of deconstruction, Lyotard's philosophy gives too much credit to illegitimate categories and groups. Underlying any differend there is a multiplicity of further differences; some of these will involve crossing the first divide, others will question the integrity of the groups that were originally separated.<ref name="Elliott, Anthony 2003">Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. "Jean Francois Lyotard." Key contemporary social theorists.2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 214.</ref>

[[Manfred Frank]] (1988) has put the [[Frankfurt School]] criticism best. It attacks Lyotard's search for division over consensus on the grounds that it involves a philosophical mistake with serious political and social repercussions. Lyotard has failed to notice that an underlying condition for consensus is also a condition for the successful communication of his own thought. It is a [[performative contradiction]] to give an account that appeals to our reason on behalf of a difference that is supposed to elude it. So, in putting forward a false argument against a rational consensus, Lyotard plays into the hands of the irrational forces that often give rise to injustice and differ ends. Worse, he is then only in a position to testify to that injustice, rather than put forward a just and rational resolution.<ref name="Elliott, Anthony 2003"/> In turn, these criticisms have been met with responses arguing that Frank misreads Lyotard's work, for example, failing to recognize the role of the sublime, as well as failing to see that Lyotard wants to go beyond the monopoly of the cognitive, argumentative genre, in order to give other genres a right to exist as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2011-12-15|editor-last=Rogozinski|editor-first=Jacob|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/cps.2341|journal=Les Cahiers philosophiques de Strasbourg|issue=30|doi=10.4000/cps.2341|issn=1254-5740|title=30 &#124; 2011 Michel Henry : Une phénoménologie radicale}}</ref>

From a [[Nietzschean]] and [[Deleuzian]] point of view (James Williams 2000), Lyotard's postmodern philosophy took a turn toward a destructive modern [[nihilism]] that his early work avoids. The different and the sublime are negative terms that introduce a severe pessimism at the core of Lyotard's philosophy. Both terms draw lines that cannot be crossed and yet they mark the threshold of that which is most valuable for the philosophy, that which is to be testified to and its proper concern. It is not possible repetitively to lend an ear to the sublime without falling into despair due to its fleeting nature. Whenever we try to understand or even memorize: the activity of testimony through the sublime, it can only be as something that has now dissipated and that we cannot capture.<ref name="Elliott, Anthony 2003"/>

Charles J. Stivale reviewed Lyotard's ''The Differend'' (in English translation) in 1990, stating:
{{quote|Jean-François Lyotard's is a dense work of philosophical, political and ethical reflection aimed at a specialized audience versed in current debates in logic, pragmatics and post-structuralism. Even George Van Den Abbeele's excellent translation, complete with a glossary of French terms not available in the original text (Paris: Minuit, 1983), does not, indeed cannot, alleviate the often terse prose with which Lyotard develops his reasoning. With this said, I must also observe that this work is of vital importance in a period when revisionism of all stripes attempts to rewrite, and often simply deny, the occurrence of historical and cultural events, i.e. in attempting to reconstruct "reality" in the convenient names of "truth" and "common sense" … This overview must leave unexplored the broad philosophical bases from which Lyotard draws support, as well as important questions that he raises regarding history, justice and critical judgement. I can conclude only by suggesting that this work, despite the formidable difficulties inherent to its carefully articulated arguments, offers readers a rich formulation of precise questions for and about the current period of critical transition and re-opening in philosophy, ethics and aesthetics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stivale|first=Charles J.|title=The Differend: Phrases in Dispute by Jean-Francois Lyotard and George van den Abbeele|journal=The French Review|year=1990|volume=63|issue=4|page=722}}</ref>}}

==Influence==
The collective tribute to Lyotard following his death was organized by the Collège International de Philosophie, and chaired by Dolores Lyotard and [[Jean-Claude Milner]], the College's director at that time. The proceedings were published by PUF in 2001 under the general title ''Jean-François Lyotard, l'exercice du différend''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |title=Pocket Pantheon: Figures of Postwar Philosophy |date=July 2009  |publisher= Verso|isbn=978-1-84467-357-5 |page=193 |chapter=A Note on the Texts }}</ref>

Lyotard's work continues to be important in [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sociology]], [[literature]], [[art]], and [[cultural studies]].<ref>Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. "Jean Francois Lyotard." Key contemporary social theorists.2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 35.</ref> To mark the tenth anniversary of Lyotard's death, an international symposium about Jean-François Lyotard organized by the [[Collège International de Philosophie]] (under the direction of Dolores Lyotard, Jean-Claude Milner and Gerald Sfez) was held in Paris from January 25–27 in 2007.

* In [[Pierre Gripari]]'s novel ''Pierrot la lune,'' he writes about a Lyotard, who is given the name "Jef" in the novel, saying that he was the only person with whom he could open up about his homosexuality: "I do not understand Jef, but I need him."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gripari|first=Pierre|title=Pierrot la lune|publisher=Paris: La Table ronde|year=1963|pages=144}}</ref>
*In a 1984 interview with [[Georges Van Den Abbeele]], Lyotard discusses how he views all the work he's published as rough drafts, noting that, "Even ''Le différend'' (1984), which I spent nine years elaborating and writing, remains a sketch, whose master I have not been. And in this sense, I can without lying plead limited responsibility. That is to say: a reader cannot incorrectly locate in a piece of writing an aspect which, according to me, is not at all there."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lyotard|first1=Jean-Francois|last2=Abbeele|first2=Georges Van Den|date=1984|title=Interview: Jean-Francois Lyotard|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/464841|journal=Diacritics|volume=14|issue=3|pages=15|doi=10.2307/464841|jstor=464841|issn=0300-7162}}</ref>
