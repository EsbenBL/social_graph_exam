'''Holmes Beckwith''' (1884 – April 2, 1921) was an American [[political science|political scientist]] and professor of [[finance]] and [[insurance]] at several universities.  He shot and killed Dean [[J. Herman Wharton]] and himself at [[Syracuse University]] on April 2, 1921.

==Education and early employment==
Beckwith was born in [[Hawaii]] to a family of ministers and missionaries, and spent his early life there and in California.<ref name="Times1">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A04E3DD103FEE3ABC4B53DFB266838A639EDE|title=Syracuse Teacher Slays College Teacher and Kills Himself|date=April 3, 1921|work=The New York Times|access-date=20 November 2009}}</ref> He received degrees in law from the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] and the [[Pacific Theological Seminary]], and in 1911 completed his Ph.D. in [[political science]] at [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=June 1912|title=Ninth List of Doctoral Dissertations in Political Economy in Progress in American Universities and Colleges|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=2|issue=2|pages=519–529}}</ref>  While at Columbia he married Frances Robinson, the daughter of a [[Berkeley, California]] minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportvol00socigoog/annualreportvol00socigoog_djvu.txt|title=Fifty-Eighth Annual Report of the Hawaiian Mission Children's Society|year=1910|publisher=Internet Archive|access-date=20 November 2009}}</ref>

Beckwith's dissertation, ''German Industrial Education and its Lessons for the United States'', was the result of a trip to Germany to observe [[vocational education|industrial education]] practices in the summer of 1911.<ref name="dissertation">{{cite book|last=Beckwith|first=Holmes|title=German Industrial Education and its Lessons for the United States|publisher=United States Bureau of Education|location=Washington, D.C.|year=1913|url=https://archive.org/details/germanindustria00beckgoog}}</ref>  The dissertation argued that "Germany has had probably the largest and most fruitful experience of such education and has most to teach us."<ref>''German Industrial Education'', 7.</ref>  It was reprinted by the Bureau of Education (then part of the [[United States Department of the Interior]]) in 1913.  Beckwith has been cited as a significant part of academic and policy debates in the period about the potential for German-style industrial education in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geitz|first=Henry|author2=Jürgen Heideking |author3=Jurgen Herbst |title=German Influences on Education in the United States to 1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1995|pages=76–79}}</ref>

After completing his dissertation, he was appointed instructor in economics at [[Dartmouth College]] in the fall of 1911.<ref>{{cite journal|date=September 1911|title=Appointments and Resignations|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=1|issue=3|pages=687}}</ref>  He later described Dartmouth as "the toughest college in America"; he was dismissed not long after arrival, following conflicts with Dartmouth professor George R. Wicker.<ref name="Times1"/>  During [[World War I]], he attended an officer's training camp but was discharged for physical disability,<ref name="Times1"/> which began a long series of brief positions with a variety of institutions.  In 1914, he worked for the [[California Department of Financial Institutions|California State Banking Commission]], but was fired after complaints about his manner from the banks.<ref name="Times1"/>  In 1916 his wife, who had supported him at times during his career, left him, eventually remarrying.<ref name="Times1"/>  In the years following, he held positions at [[Grinnell College]] and the [[Kellogg School of Management|Northwestern University School of Commerce]], both rather briefly.<ref>{{cite journal|date=March 1918|title=Appointments and Resignations|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=8|issue=1|pages=241}}</ref>  He taught for one year at [[Colorado College]] in 1920, where he became friendly with folklorist [[Stith Thompson]], who had just begun his first academic appointment there.  In his memoirs, Thompson describes Beckwith as "an extremely odd character, utterly unable to adapt to his environment."<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Stith|title=A Folklorist's Progress: Reflections of a Scholar's Life|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|year=1996|page=76}}</ref>  Soon after, Thompson was asked by a department head to explain to Beckwith that he would not be reappointed; Thompson reports that his colleague "received me very cordially and seemed to appreciate my interest and frankness."  Shortly thereafter, Beckwith was appointed to his final position at Syracuse.<ref name="Thompson"/>

After his death, Beckwith was described as having "[[socialism|Socialistic]] beliefs," but was not active in any socialist organization.<ref name="Times2">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D05E3DD1739E133A25757C0A9629C946095D6CF|title=Says Beckwith Took Revenge on Society|date=April 4, 1921|work=The New York Times|access-date=20 November 2009}}</ref>

==Murder and suicide==
In late March 1921, Beckwith was informed by Dean Wharton that he would be dismissed; after Beckwith protested, Wharton told him that students had complained about him.<ref name="Times1"/>  Beckwith argued with Wharton twice at his house, and went to see him a final time in the dean's office on April 2, bearing a letter, later found on Wharton's desk, declaring his dismissal to be unfair, and that other professors were more popular because they were "too lax"; he also carried a military revolver and a knife.<ref name="Times1"/>  Beckwith shot Wharton five times and himself once.<ref name="Times1"/>

After his death, a number of letters were found addressed to relatives and university administrators in Beckwith's hand; the letters complained of a life of failure and misunderstanding, apologized to relatives, and made clear that the murder was premeditated (and that Beckwith had contemplated murdering other academic administrators previously).<ref name="Times1"/>  Beckwith's uncle suggested the following day, in a statement of condolence and regret, that he did not believe his nephew "was dealing in personalities when he shot the Dean, but that the act was just his disordered expression of compensation for the wrongs and injustice he believed the world did him."<ref name="Times2"/> Physicians and psychologists interviewed by ''The New York Times'' suggested Beckwith had an "exaggerated ego" and compared him to the notorious murderer [[Harry Kendall Thaw]].<ref name="Times2"/>
