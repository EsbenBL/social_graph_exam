'''Willmoore Kendall''' (1909 – June 30, 1967)<ref>[http://www.mmisi.org/pr/33_01/el.pdf "The Eric Voegelin–Willmoore Kendall Correspondence,"] ''The Political Science Reviewer,'' Vol. 33, No. 1, 2004, p. 412 (footnote).</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[conservatism|conservative]] writer and a [[professor]] of [[political philosophy]].

==Early life and education==
Kendall was born in 1909 to a [[blindness|blind]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] in [[Oklahoma]].  He learned to read at 2, graduated from high school at 13, from the [[University of Oklahoma]] at 18, and published his first book at 20. In 1932, he studied at the [[University of Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes scholar]].

Kendall became a [[Trotskyist]] and went to Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. His experiences with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] led him to renounce his former communist beliefs. In 1940, he obtained a Ph.D. in [[political science]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], learning under [[Francis Wilson (political scientist)|Francis Wilson]].  His dissertation was "John Locke and the Doctrine of Majority-Rule", which provided a unique view of [[John Locke|Locke]]: Kendall saw him more as a proto-democrat who would approve of societies governed by [[majority rule]], rather than an individualist who wished for an aloof government as was the more common consensus view.<ref name="prophets" />  Kendall served in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] in [[World War II]] and stayed on when it became the [[CIA]], in 1947.

==Career==
Kendall joined the [[Yale University]] faculty in 1947, where he taught for 14 quarrelsome years until Yale paid him a handsome sum to resign. In 1961, he surrendered [[tenure]] and departed.<ref>Ceaser, James W. and Robert Maranto (2009). "Why Political Science Is Left But Not Quite PC: Causes of Disunion and Diversity." In ''The Politically Correct University: Problems, Scope, and Reforms'', Robert Maranto (ed.), Richard E. Redding (ed.), Frederick M. Hess (ed.), Washington, D.C.: The [[American Enterprise Institute]] Press, p. 219.</ref> Among his students was [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] with whom he participated in the founding of ''[[National Review]]''; as a senior editor, he constantly fought with the other editors (it is said that he was never on speaking terms with more than one person at a time). Another student that Kendall strongly influenced on the Right was Brent Bozell, whom he also taught at Yale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kazin|first1=Michael|title=The Populist Persuasion|url=https://archive.org/details/populistpersuasi00kazirich|url-access=registration|date=1995|publisher=BasicBooks|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/populistpersuasi00kazirich/page/171 171]|isbn=9780465037933}}</ref> Kendall also influenced Buckley's ideas in the ''National Review'' because he explained that liberals were a small minority group in the community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kazin|first1=Michael|title=The Populist Persuasion|url=https://archive.org/details/populistpersuasi00kazirich|url-access=registration|date=1995|publisher=BasicBooks|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/populistpersuasi00kazirich/page/172 172]|isbn=9780465037933}}</ref> A friend, Professor [[Revilo P. Oliver]], gave him credit with convincing him to enter political activism by writing for ''National Review''.<ref>Revilo P. Oliver, [http://www.heretical.com/oliver/index.html ''Autobiographical Note''.]</ref>  After Yale, Kendall lived in Spain and France for a time, and briefly taught at several universities in a non-tenured role.<ref name="prophets" />

He is often forgotten as a founder of the conservative movement because he never wrote a "big book," rather he put together a collection of reviews and essays.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Daniel|title=Willmoore Kendall: Forgotten Founder of Conservatism|url=http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/03/willmoore-kendall-conservative-movement-daniel-mccarthy.html|website=[[The Imaginative Conservative]]|accessdate=November 14, 2017|date=2017-03-30}}</ref>

Kendall later converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], taught at the [[University of Dallas]], was a founder of the politics program, and was co-founder of the doctoral program there. Kendall was also the Chairman of the Department of Politics and Economics at the University.<ref>http://www.mmisi.org/pr/03_01/east.pdf</ref> He stayed at that institution until he died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], in 1967.

==Philosophy==
Kendall defended majority-rule democracy in America.<ref>Havers, Grant. "Willmoore Kendall for Our Times." Modern Age, vol. 53, no. 1/2, Winter/Spring2011, pp. 121-124.</ref>  He felt that [[majoritarianism]] should come before liberalism (in the political philosophy sense of [[liberal democracy]]) - that the government should not undercut the social consensus by attempting to enforce abstract rights.  On those grounds, he supported [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] for example - if the society of Southern states found this acceptable to their consensus, they should be allowed to impose this; civil rights agitators were disrupting the social consensus and group morality.<ref name="prophets">{{cite web |last1=Tait |first1=Joshua |title=Why Willmoore Kendall And James Burnham Are the Prophets of Modern Conservatism |url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-willmoore-kendall-and-james-burnham-are-prophets-modern-conservatism-184046 |publisher=The National Interest |language=en |date=April 30, 2021}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Kendall is the model for the character Jesse Frank in S. Zion's 1990 novel ''Markers''.<ref>Hart, Jeffrey (1990). "Debts Paid in Full," ''National Review'', Vol. 42, No. 11, pp. 52–53.</ref>
