==Biography==

===Early life and ancestors===
Ladd was born in [[Painesville, Ohio]], on January 19, 1842, the son of Silas Trumbull Ladd and Elizabeth Williams.<ref>Leonard, John W. (1901).[https://books.google.com/books?id=ov0UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA654 Ladd, "George Trumbull,"] ''Who's who in America,'' p.654.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMEOs4na_yAC&pg=PA281|title=THE CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN BIOGRAPHY|first=James E.|last=Homans|date=August 30, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>His father, Silas, ran a general store in [[Hudson, Ohio]] and was a deacon in his church, filled various minor town offices, and was held in high esteem for his integrity, industry and kindliness. He served as treasurer of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]], now [[Case Western Reserve University]], when the institution was located at Hudson, Ohio.

O. Brastow Dies,"] ''New York Times.'' August 11, 1912.</ref>

He was a grandson of Jesse Ladd and Ruby Brewster,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~maberksh/towns/washington/wm.html|title=Washington, Massachusetts Marriage Records to 1850|first=Laurel O'Donnell, ZAPIX|last=Design|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}</ref> who were among the original pioneers in [[Madison, Ohio|Madison]], [[Lake County, Ohio]]. Ruby was a granddaughter of Oliver Brewster<ref name="'Brewster Genealogy">Jones, Emma. (1908). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PDY2AAAAMAAJ&dq=emma+c+brewster+jones1  ''The Brewster genealogy, 1566-1907: a Record of the Descendants of William Brewster of the "Mayflower,"''  p. 86.]</ref> and [[Martha Wadsworth Brewster]], a poet and writer, and one of the earliest American female literary figures.

He was a descendant of Elder [[William Brewster (pilgrim)|William Brewster]] (c. 1567 – April 10, 1644), the Pilgrim leader and spiritual elder of the [[Plymouth Colony]] and a passenger on the ''[[Mayflower]]'', and [[Governor William Bradford]] (1590–1657) of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the ''Mayflower''. He was also a 7th generation direct lineal descendant of Daniel Ladd, Sr. (1613–1693).<ref>Daniel Ladd, Sr. was born in 1613 in Deal, Kent County, England. He died on July 27, 1693 at the age of 80 in Haverhill, Essex County, Massachusetts. On March 24, 1633, took the "Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance, thus enabling him to leave London, England and take the Vessel "Mary And John" (Robert Sayres, Master). First mentioned in Ipswich town records in February 1637; in Salibury, MA, October 29, 1639, and was one of the first settlers of Haverhill, MA. On February 5, 1637 he was granted six acres of land on which he built a house...On October 29, 1639 and September 7, 1640, he had land granted to him in Salisbury. From Salisbury he removed to Haverhill where he died. His house in Haverhill was in the village, his planting lots were in two different locations while his meadows were located in seven different locations. In 1659 Daniel erected a sawmill with Theophilus Shatwell on the Spiggot (Spicket) River. It was built within the present limits of Salem, New Hampshire and was the first mill erected on that stream. An extensive account of Daniel Ladd is provided on pages1 through 11 of "The Ladd Family" as well as on pages 12-21 of "Lest We Forget: AFamily Saga"From the NEHG Register, Vol 38, p. 345. According to the record of the Quarterly Court of Essex County:"Daniel Ladd was accounted a man of good social graces." He held at one time the rank of Lieutenant.</ref>

===Education===
He early gave indications of the studious habits that characterized him through life. When he was eight years old his first savings, two dollars, were spent for a copy of Josephus and Plutarch, while when eighteen years of age he read [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[Critique of Pure Reason]].

Most of his work in preparing for college was done by himself, only a portion of the time being given to the curriculum in the Painesville High School and at the college preparatory school of the Rev. Mr. Brayton in Painesville, Ohio.

He graduated from [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] in 1864 and from [[Andover Theological Seminary]] in 1869. He was ordained to the Congregational ministry on May 26, 1870. The degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]] (D.D. or DD, ''Divinitatis Doctor'' in Latin) was conferred on him by Western Reserve College in 1879; Yale University that of M.A. in 1881, Western Reserve College that of LL.D. in 1895, and [[Princeton University]] that of LL.D. in 1896.

===Career===
After graduation, he went into business with his father. His constant studies, however, seemed to turn his steps naturally toward a higher institution of learning, with the result that in 1866 he went to the Andover Theological Seminary.

In 1869, he was installed as the pastor of the Congregational Church in [[Edinburg, Ohio|Edinburg]], [[Portage County, Ohio]], remaining here until 1871. In 1871 he began to preach at the Spring Street Congregational Church of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin]] leaving in 1879.<ref>[http://www.linkstothepast.com/milwaukee/ch_congregational1.php "Free Congregational Church (a//k/a Spring St. Congregation after 1847),"] Milwaukee County Congregational Churches.</ref> He was professor of intellectual and moral philosophy at [[Bowdoin College]] from 1879 to 1881, and 'Clark Professor of [[Metaphysics]] and [[Moral Philosophy]]' at [[Yale University]] (a professorship that still exists) from 1881 until 1901, when he took charge of the Graduate Department of Philosophy and [[Psychology]]. Ladd became [[Professor Emeritus]] in 1905, and retired in 1906.

During 1879 to 1882 he lectured on theology at Andover Theological Seminary, and in 1883 at [[Harvard University]], where during the time period of 1895 to 1896 he conducted a graduate seminar in [[ethics]].

Between 1892 and 1899, at the invitation of the [[Government of Japan]], he served as a diplomatic adviser and helped the Cabinet under Prime Minister [[Hirobumi Ito]] (1841–1909) to promote mutual understanding between Japan and the United States.

He lectured at [[National Seven Universities|Imperial University]] in [[Japan]] in 1892 and 1899 (when he also visited the universities of [[India]] in [[Calcutta]], [[Bombay]] and [[Benares]]) and again from 1906 to 1907.<ref>Ladd, George.

The series of lectures he delivered in Japan revolutionized its educational methods;<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/02/22/105003345.pdf Topics of the Week: "George Trumbull Ladd,"] ''New York Times.'' February 22, 1908.</ref> In 1899, [[Emperor Meiji]] conferred the [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon]], which represents the third highest of eight classes associated with the award. Trumbull was again honored in 1907, this time with the [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star]], which represents the second highest of eight classes. He was the first foreigner to receive the honor in this class.<ref name="time1939">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071128152839/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,761252,00.html "Business: Japanese Strip,"] ''Time Magazine.''

October 22, 1899.</ref> He was a member of the [[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

He was much influenced by the German philosopher [[Hermann Lotze]], whose ''Outlines of Philosophy'' he translated (6 vols., 1877) and was one of the first to introduce (1879) the study of [[experimental psychology]] into America; the Yale psychological laboratory being founded by him. In 1887, he published ''Elements of Physiological Psychology'', the first American textbook to include a substantial amount of information on the new experimental form of the discipline.

===Marriage and family===
He married on December 8, 1869 at Bridgeport, [[Belmont County, Ohio]], Cornelia Ann Tallman, born August 26, 1842 at [[St. Clairsville, Ohio|St. Clairsville]], Belmont County, Ohio and died on October 19, 1893 at [[North Haven, Connecticut|North Haven]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut]].<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/10/20/109713153.pdf Obituary: "Cornelia A.
