{{short description|Activity that has been interrupted may be more readily recalled}}
Named after Soviet psychologist [[Bluma Zeigarnik]], in [[psychology]] the '''Zeigarnik effect''' occurs when an activity that has been interrupted may be more readily [[Recall (memory)|recalled]]. It postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. In [[Gestalt psychology]], the Zeigarnik effect has been used to demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition.<ref>cf. Kurt Koffka, ''Principles of Gestalt Psychology'', 1935, pp 334ff.</ref>

The Zeigarnik effect should not be confused with the [[Ovsiankina effect]]. [[Maria Ovsiankina]], a colleague of Zeigarnik, investigated the effect of task interruption on the tendency to resume the task at the next opportunity.<ref>Ovsiankina 1928: ''Die Wiederaufnahme unterbrochener Handlungen''. In: ''Psychologische Forschung'' 11(3/4), 302–379. [https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00410261 doi=0.1007/BF00410261]</ref>

==Overview==
Russian psychologist [[Bluma Zeigarnik]] first studied the phenomenon after her professor and [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychologist [[Kurt Lewin]] noticed that a [[waiter]] had better recollections of still unpaid orders. However, after the completion of the task – after everyone had paid – he was unable to remember any more details of the orders. Zeigarnik then designed a series of experiments to uncover the processes underlying this phenomenon. Her research report was published in 1927, in the journal ''[[Psychological Research|Psychologische Forschung]].''<ref>[http://interruptions.net/literature/Zeigarnik-PsychologischeForschung27.pdf Zeigarnik, B. (1927). Das Behalten erledigter und unerledigter Handlungen. ''Psychologische Forschung'', 9, 1-85.]: a condensed and abridged English version: Zeigarnik, B. (1938), "On Finished and Unfinished Tasks", pp.300-314 in [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.198039 W. D. Ellis (Ed.), ''A Sourcebook of Gestalt Psychology'', London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.]</ref>

The advantage of remembrance can be explained by looking at [[Field theory (psychology)|Lewin's field theory]]: a task that has already been started establishes a task-specific tension, which improves cognitive accessibility of the relevant contents.<ref name=Lewin1935>[[Kurt Lewin]], ''A Dynamic Theory of Personality'', 1935, pp 243ff</ref> The tension is relieved upon completion of the task, but persists if it is interrupted. Through continuous tension, the content is made more easily accessible, and can be easily remembered.<ref name=Lewin1935/>

The Zeigarnik effect suggests that students who suspend their study to perform unrelated activities (such as studying a different subject or playing a game), will remember material better than students who complete study sessions without a break (McKinney 1935; Zeigarnik 1927).

==Harden rule==
Sportswriter Matt Moore has suggested that the Zeigarnik effect could explain the widespread criticism of the [[National Basketball Association]] in allowing [[free throws]] for a player "chucking it up whenever a guy comes near them."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Matt |title=How the NBA's newly imposed 'Harden Rule' will impact James Harden this season |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-the-nbas-newly-imposed-harden-rule-will-impact-james-harden-this-season/ |access-date=21 April 2020 |work=CBSSports.com |date=4 October 2017 |language=en}}</ref>  There is a stoppage of play with each foul. When repeatedly done, it is felt to build up a [[cognitive bias]] against this move. The criticism necessitated a rule change penalizing this activity, known as the Harden Rule, named after its most prominent user, [[James Harden]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boone|first1=Kyle|title=The NBA is finally cracking down on James Harden's foul-drawing antics|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-nba-is-finally-cracking-down-on-james-hardens-foul-drawing-antics/|website=CBSSports.com|access-date=October 4, 2017|date=September 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NBA implementing 'Zaza Pachulia,' 'James Harden' rules|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/09/21/nba-implementing-zaza-pachulia-james-harden-rules/|website=NBCSports.com|access-date=October 4, 2017|date=September 21, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The reliability of the effect has been a matter of some controversy.<ref name="Einstein2003">{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Gilles O.|last2=McDaniel|first2=Mark A.|last3=Williford|first3=Carrie L.|last4=Pagan|first4=Jason L.|last5=Dismukes|first5=R.

Several studies, performed later in other countries, attempting to replicate Zeigarnik's experiment, failed to find any significant differences in recall between "finished" and "unfinished" (interrupted) tasks (e.g., Van Bergen, 1968).<ref>{{Cite Q | Q91935831 }}</ref>

==Usages==

=== Software ===
Zeigarnik effect is being used in some [[SaaS]] systems to [[User onboarding|onboard users]] faster and effectively.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Zeigarnik effect emphasizes an "Aha! moment" as an uncompleted task.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Usually, being implemented as user interactions gamification. These are some examples:

* Progress trackers which inform users of how close they are to complete a task. When users see a message like "Your profile is 64% complete", they are more likely to spend a few minutes on providing all missing details.
* Checklists to provide a clear step-by-step on-boarding flow.
