Andersen also serves as an elected member of the Town Board in [[Cazenovia, New York]].

==Early work and education==
Andersen grew up in [[Nebraska]].<ref name=eagle1>{{cite news |title=Andersen nominated by Dems for re-election to Cazenovia town board|url=https://www.eaglenewsonline.com/news/new/government/2017/09/15/andersen-nominated-by-dems-for-re-election-to-cazenovia-town-board/ |date=15 September 2017 |work=Eagle News Online |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> As an undergraduate, she attended [[Smith College]], graduating with a BA in 1969.<ref name=profile>{{cite web |url=https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/andersen/ |title=Kristi Andersen |publisher=Syracuse University |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> She then attended the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an MA in 1973 and a PhD in 1976.<ref name=profile/> Her PhD dissertation, ''How Realignments Happen: Mobilization and the Creation of a Democratic Majority, 1928-1936'', received the 1977 [[American Political Science Association]]'s [[Elmer Eric Schattschneider|E. E. Schattschneider]] Award for "the best doctoral dissertation in the field of American government" that year.<ref name=ee>{{cite web |url=https://www.apsanet.org/PROGRAMS/APSA-Awards/EE-Schattschneider-Award |title=E. E. Schattschneider Award |publisher=American Political Science Association |year=2018 |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>

From 1973 to 1975, Andersen was Associate Study Director at the [[NORC at the University of Chicago|National Opinion Research Center]] at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name=profile/> She then joined the political science faculty at [[The Ohio State University]], where from 1981 to 1984 she was also the Director of the Polimetrics Laboratory.<ref name=profile/> In 1984, she moved to the political science department at Syracuse University.<ref name=profile/>

==Career==
Andersen has written three books: ''New Immigrant Communities: Finding a Place in Local Politics'' (2010), ''After Suffrage: Women in Partisan and Electoral Politics Before the New Deal'' (1996), and ''The Creation of a Democratic Majority, 1928-1936'' (1979). Her first book, ''The Creation of a Democratic Majority'', presented evidence that [[Realigning election|party realignments]] in the United States, like the creation of the [[New Deal coalition]], can be the result of mobilizing non-voters to [[Voter turnout|turn out]] to vote rather than frequent voters switching parties.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul Allen |last=Beck |title=Reviewed Work: The Creation of a Democratic Majority, 1928-1936 by Kristi Andersen |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=74 |issue=1 |date=March 1980 |pages=185⁠–186 |doi=10.2307/1955684|jstor=1955684 }}</ref> William Schneider particularly praised the book's [[political methodology|quantitative methodology]], writing that the book "should be required reading in all introductory quantitative methods courses in order to convince skeptical students that real knowledge can be gained through careful quantitative work."<ref>{{cite journal |first=William |last=Schneider |title=Reviewed Work: The Creation of a Democratic Majority 1928-1936. by Kristi Andersen |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=95 |issue=1 |year=1980 |pages=148⁠–150 |doi=10.2307/2149602|jstor=2149602 }}</ref>

Andersen's second book, ''After Suffrage: Women in Partisan and Electoral Politics Before the New Deal'', was published in 1996. The book contradicts the conventional wisdom that [[Women's suffrage in the United States]] had a surprisingly small impact on women and citizenship, and that the activist networks that led to suffrage collapsed soon after it.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Glenna |last=Matthews |title=Reviewed Work: After Suffrage: Women in Partisan and Electoral Politics before the New Deal. by Kristi Andersen |journal=The Journal of American History |volume=84 |issue=1 |date=June 1997 |pages=280⁠–281 |doi=10.2307/2952848|jstor=2952848 }}</ref> ''After suffrage'' earned Andersen the 1997 [[Victoria Schuck Award]] from the American Political Science Association,<ref name=vsa>{{cite web |url=http://web.mnstate.edu/schwartz/AmerPoliSciAssocSchuck.html |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |title=Victoria Schuck Award |publisher=Minnesota State University |year=2018 |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> which honors the best book published on the topic of women and politics each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apsanet.org/PROGRAMS/APSA-Awards/Victoria-Schuck-Award |title=Victoria Schuck Award |publisher=American Political Science Association |year=2019 |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>

Andersen published her third book, ''New Immigrant Communities: Finding a Place in Local Politics'', in 2010. The book studies the incorporation of immigrants into the American political system by focusing on the acquisition of political power by immigrants to the small American cities of [[Chico, California|Chico]], [[Spokane]], [[Waco]], [[East Lansing]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and [[Fort Collins]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Rodolfo |last=O. de la Garza |title=Reviewed Work: New Immigrant Communities: Finding a Place in Local Politics by Kristi Andersen |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=127 |issue=1 |year=2012 |pages=155⁠–156|doi=10.1002/j.1538-165X.2012.tb02225.x }}</ref>

Andersen has held several named professorships at Syracuse University. In 1999, she was named Maxwell Professor of Teaching Excellence.<ref name=profile/> Later, she was a Laura J. and L. Douglas Meredith Professor for Teaching Excellence from 2002 to 2005.<ref name=meredith>{{cite web |url=https://provost.syr.edu/faculty-affairs/faculty-recognition-programs/meredith-professorships/meredith-professors/ |title=Meredith Professors |publisher=Syracuse University |year=2019 |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> The professorship was granted to facilitate the development of a handbook of teaching quality indicators for use in evaluating faculty members' teaching.<ref name=meredith/> In 2010, she became the Chapple Family Professor of Citizenship and Democracy, which is an endowed professorship.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.syr.edu/blog/2010/03/24/kristi-andersen/ |title=Maxwell School names Andersen as new Chapple Family Professor |publisher=Syracuse University |date=24 March 2010 |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>
