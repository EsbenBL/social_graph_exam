'''Michael Dunlop Young, Baron Young of Dartington''' (9 August 1915 – 14 January 2002), was a British sociologist, social activist and politician who coined the term "[[meritocracy]]". He was an urbanist of different dimensions such as academic researcher, polemicist and institution-builder.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|pages=780}}</ref>

During an active life he was instrumental in shaping [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] thinking. When secretary of the policy committee of the Labour Party, he was responsible for drafting "Let Us Face the Future", Labour's manifesto for the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]],<ref name="Young">{{cite news |last=Young |first=Michael |date=29 June 2001 |title=Down with meritocracy: The man who coined the word four decades ago wishes Tony Blair would stop using it |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> was a leading protagonist on social reform, and founded or helped found a number of socially useful organisations. These include the [[Which?|Consumers' Association]], ''[[Which?]]'' magazine, the [[Consumer Focus|National Consumer Council]], the [[Open University]], the [[Institute for Community Studies]], the [[National Extension College]], the [[Open College of the Arts]] and [[Language Line]], a telephone-interpreting business.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Michael Young (1915-2002) -Highgate Cemetery-10Aug2008.jpg|upright|thumb|Grave in Highgate Cemetery, London]]
Young was born in [[Manchester]], the son of (Ernest) Gibson Young, an Australian violinist and music critic; and an Irish [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] painter and actress, Edith Hermia Dunlop. According to Michael's son, Toby Young, Gibson was a "ne'er-do-well", and "the only silver his forebears possessed was what they were able to steal from the gentry".<ref name="spectator.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2007/11/im-proud-that-my-ancestor-served-at-trafalgar-but-not-too-proud-to-sell-his-stuff/|title=I'm proud that my ancestor served at Trafalgar. But not too proud to sell his stuff|date=2007-11-07|website=The Spectator|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-05}}</ref>

Until he was eight, Young grew up in [[Melbourne]], returning to England shortly before his parents' marriage broke up. He attended several schools, eventually entering [[Dartington Hall]], a new progressive school in Devon, in the 1920s. He had a long association with the small school, as student, trustee, deputy chairman and historian. He studied economics at the [[London School of Economics]] (BScEcon, MA), then became a [[barrister]] when he applied to be [[called to the Bar]] in 1939.

==Political career and thought==
During the [[Second World War]], Young served as director of the [[Political and Economic Planning]] [[think tank]] and became director of research for the Labour Party where he wrote the manifesto for the 1945 general election and the vast speakers' handbook. He served under the Labour Party government led by [[Clement Attlee]], but left in 1950 saying the party had run out of ideas. He called for the establishment of a [[Economic and Social Research Council|Social Science Research Council]] and became its first director 17 years later.<ref name="Dean">{{cite news |last=Dean |first=Malcolm |date=16 Jan 2002 |title=Lord Young of Dartington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/16/guardianobituaries.books |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=24 February 2016}}</ref>

He began studying for a PhD at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1952. His thesis, dated 1955, was titled [http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3739/ A study of the extended family in East London].<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Young|first=Michael Dunlop|date=2000|title=A study of the extended family in East London|type=PhD|publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science|url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3739/|access-date=25 June 2021}}</ref>  His studies of housing and local government policy in East London left him disillusioned with the state of community relations and local Labour councillors. This prompted him to found the [[Institute of Community Studies]], which was his principal vehicle for exploring his ideas of social reform. Its basic tenet was to give people more say in running their lives and institutions.  Butler argues that it  drew upon existing bodies of research in social psychology and sociology to highlight the relevance of the extended family in modern society and to offer a model of socialist citizenship, solidarity and mutual support not tied to productive work. Young promoted the supportive kinship networks of the urban working class, and an idealized conception of the relationships between women, to suggest that family had been overlooked by the left and should be reclaimed as a progressive force. The goal was to strengthen the working-class family as set it up as a model for cooperative socialism.<ref>{{harvnb|Butler|2015}}</ref>

He also founded the Mutual Aid Centre at this time. Young co-authored with Peter Willmott ''[[Family and Kinship in East London]]'', documenting and analysing the social costs of rehousing a tight-knit community in a suburban housing estate (known affectionately by sociologists as ''Fakinel'' and invariably pronounced with a [[cockney]] accent).<ref group="note">In [[Cockney]] [[wikt:fucking hell|fa.kɪ.neəl sounds like an expletive]]</ref>

In 1958, Young also wrote the influential satire ''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]'', originally for the [[Fabian Society]], which refused to publish it. In it he coined the word "[[meritocracy]]", to which he gave negative connotations, and he became disappointed with how the concept came to be seen as an achievable concept worth pursuing.<ref name="Young"/>

Young's social research also contributed to the change in secondary education that led to widespread abolition of [[grammar schools]] and their replacement by comprehensive schools between 1965 and 1976, as well as the abolition of the [[eleven plus exam|11-plus]].<ref>{{cite news |last=White |first=Michael |author-link=Michael White (journalist) |date=15 January 2002 |title=Innovative thinker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/16/highereducation.obituaries |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=12 January 2015}}</ref>{{irrelevant citation|date=February 2016|reason=doesn't mention schools}}

In the 1950s and 1960s Young helped to found the [[Which?|Consumers' Association]] and the National Consumer Council claiming that "politics will become less and less the politics of production, and more and more the politics of consumption", presenting the ideas in a book ''The Chipped White Cups Of Dover''.<ref name="Dean"/>

In 1960 he started the Advisory Centre for Education<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of the Advisory Centre for Education|url=http://www.ace-ed.org.uk/about-ace-education/history-of-advisory-centre-for-education|access-date=Feb 24, 2016}}</ref> the National Extension College and, with [[Peter Laslett]], a dawn university on [[Anglia Television]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Asa|author-link=Asa Briggs|title=The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0pRGjVGtUvwC&pg=PA476|volume=Volume V: Competition|year=1995|page=476|isbn=9780192159649}}</ref> which became prototypes of the Open University which [[Harold Wilson]] launched in 1964, building on his vision.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The OU Story|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/strategy/ou-story|publisher=The Open University|access-date=Feb 24, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Dean"/>

In the mid-1980s, Young co-founded [[International Alert]], together with [[Leo Kuper]] and [[Martin Ennals]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9t1nb5sg/|title=Finding Aid for the Leo Kuper Papers, 1951-1993|website=www.oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2019-09-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Totten |last=Samuel |title=The State and Future of Genocide Studies and Prevention: An Overview and Analysis of Some Key Issues |journal=Genocide Studies and Prevention |volume=6 |issue=3 |id=4 |year=2011 |pages=211–230 |doi=10.3138/gsp.6.3.211  |url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&context=gsp}}</ref>

In 1987 he founded the Open College of the Arts, confounding critics who maintained that the arts could not be taught by distance methods. He also founded [[Language Line]], a telephone interpreting business, to enable non-English-speaking people to have equal access to public services. He fostered the work of many younger researchers and "social entrepreneurs", and founded the [[School for Social Entrepreneurs]] in 1997. Aspects of Young's work are being developed by the [[Young Foundation]], created from the merger of his Institute of Community Studies and his Mutual Aid Centre, under the direction of [[Geoff Mulgan]].

Throughout his life, and particularly in later life, Young was concerned for older people. In 1982 he co-founded the [[University of the Third Age]] with Peter Laslett and [[Eric Midwinter]],<ref name="Midwinter">{{cite book |last=Midwinter |first=Eric |author-link=Eric Midwinter |title=500 Beacons: The U3A Story |date=2014 |orig-year=2002 |publisher=[[University of the Third Age|Third Age Press]]}}</ref> and Linkage, bringing together older people without grandchildren and young people without grandparents. In 2001 he co-founded the charity [[Grandparents Plus]] to champion the role of the wider family in children's lives.

According to his friend Eric Midwinter, "All his thought, all his incisive writing, all his brilliantly conceived schemes, all his astutely handled initiatives were guided by a salient method. He was a [[utopian socialist]]. His thinking stemmed from the views of 19th century radicals like [[Robert Owen]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] or [[Charles Fourier]], with their hatred of massive institutionalism, be it in the hands of the public authority or of the large commercial company."<ref name="Midwinter"/>

Young was a fellow of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], from 1961 to 1966, and president of [[Birkbeck, University of London]], from 1989 to 1992.

Although an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], Young accepted a [[life peerage]] on 20 March 1978, taking the title '''Baron Young of Dartington''', ''of [[Dartington]] in the [[Devon|County of Devon]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=47497 |date=23 March 1978 |page=3663}}</ref> His many projects required frequent travel to London and the peerage offered free rail travel and attendance allowance at a time when he had run out of money.<ref name="Dean"/>

==Personal life==
Young married three times. In 1945 he married Joan Lawton, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. They divorced and in December 1961 he married Sasha (d. 1993; daughter of Raisley Stewart Moorsom and a descendant of Admiral Sir [[Robert Moorsom]]),<ref name="spectator.co.uk"/><ref>Burke's Peerage and Baronetage 1999, vol. 2, p. 3093</ref> a novelist, sculptor and painter with whom he had a daughter (who was born before their marriage) and a son, the journalist and writer [[Toby Young]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Young |first=Toby |author-link=Toby Young |date=24 March 2010 |title=My father would be pleased about the launch of a British space agency |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2010/03/my-father-would-be-pleased-about-the-launch-of-a-british-space-agency/ |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> Young and Moorsom worked together on several projects, including in the [[township (South Africa)|township]]s of South Africa.
