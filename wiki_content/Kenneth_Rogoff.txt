'''Kenneth Saul Rogoff''' (born March 22, 1953) is an American [[economist]] and [[chess]] [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]]. He is the Thomas D. Cabot Professor of Public Policy and Professor of Economics at [[Harvard University]].

== Early life ==
Rogoff grew up in [[Rochester, New York]]. His father was a Professor of Radiology at the [[University of Rochester]].

Rogoff received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Yale University]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1975,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=28 October 2005|title=Kenneth Rogoff -- Biographical Information|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/bio/eng/kr.htm|access-date=28 December 2020|website=[[International Monetary Fund]]}}</ref> and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Economics]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1980.<ref name=":0" />

== Chess ==
At sixteen Rogoff dropped out of high school to concentrate on chess. He won the United States Junior Championship in 1969 and spent the next several years living primarily in Europe and playing in tournaments there. However, at eighteen he made the decision to go to college and pursue a career in economics rather than to become a professional player, although he continued to play and improve for several years afterward. Rogoff was awarded the IM title in 1974, and the GM title in 1978. He was 3rd in the World Junior Championship of 1971 and finished 2nd in the US Championship of 1975, which doubled as a Zonal competition, a half point behind [[Walter Browne]]; this result qualified him for the 1976 [[Biel Chess Festival|Interzonal]] at [[Biel]] where he finished 13–15th. In other tournaments, he drew for first at Norristown in 1973 and at Orense in 1976.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessplayer?pid=44815 |title=Kenneth Rogoff |publisher=Chessgames.com |access-date=April 18, 2013}}</ref> He has also drawn individual games against former world champions [[Mikhail Tal]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1140303 |title=Mikhail Tal vs Kenneth Rogoff |publisher=Chessgames.com |access-date=April 18, 2013}}</ref> and [[Tigran Petrosian]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1107116 |title=Tigran Vartanovich Petrosian vs Kenneth Rogoff |publisher=Chessgames.com |access-date=April 18, 2013}}</ref> In 2012 he drew a blitz game with the world's highest rated player [[Magnus Carlsen]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lubomir-kavalek/magnus-carlsen-storms-new_b_1855241.html |title=Magnus Carlsen Storms New York's Chess Scene |first=Lubomir |last=Kavalek |date=September 5, 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]] |access-date=April 18, 2013}}</ref>

== Career ==
Early in his career, Rogoff served as an economist at the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and at the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]].

Rogoff was the Charles and Marie Robertson Professor of International Affairs at [[Princeton University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ineteconomics.org/people/kenneth-rogoff |title=Kenneth Rogoff |publisher=[[Institute for New Economic Thinking]] |access-date=April 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627143311/http://ineteconomics.org/people/kenneth-rogoff |archive-date=June 27, 2013 }}</ref>

In 2002, Rogoff was in the spotlight because of a dispute with [[Joseph Stiglitz]], former chief economist of the [[World Bank]] and 2001 [[Nobel Prize]] winner. After Stiglitz criticized the IMF in his book, ''Globalization and Its Discontents'', Rogoff replied in an open letter.<ref>{{Cite web

== 2008 near-meltdown ==
Fellow Keynesian economist [[Alan Blinder]] credits both Rogoff and [[Carmen Reinhart]] with describing highly relevant aspects of the 2008 financial institution near-meltdown and resulting serious recession.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Blinder|first=Alan S.|date=2015-04-03|title=What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?|url=https://www.princeton.edu/ceps/workingpapers/243blinder.pdf|journal=The Journal of Economic Education|language=en|publisher=Princeton University Griswold Center for Economic Policy|volume=46|issue=2|pages=135–149|doi=10.1080/00220485.2015.1015190|s2cid=144314357|issn=0022-0485}}</ref>

According to Alan Blinder, in a normal recession such as 1991 or 2000, the Keynesian tools of tax cuts and infrastructure spending (fiscal stimulus), as well as lowered interest rates (monetary stimulus), will usually right the economic ship in a matter of months and lead to recovery and economic expansion.  Even the serious recession of 1982, which Blinder states "was called the Great Recession in its day," fits comfortably within this category of a normal recession which will respond to the standard tools.<ref name=":1" />

By contrast, the 2008 near-meltdown destroyed parts of the financial system and left other parts reeling and in serious need of de-leveraging.  Large amounts of governmental debt, household debt, corporate debt, and financial institution debt were left in its wake.  And because of this debt, the normal tools of tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending were somewhat less available and/or politically difficult to achieve. (Fiscal policy at times even ended up becoming pro-cyclical, which it was in some European countries under austerity policies.) In the United States, economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued that even the combination of the Oct. 2008 bailout plus the Feb. 2009 bailout was not big enough, although Blinder states that they were large compared to previous bailouts.  And, since interest rates were already near zero, the standard monetary tool of lowering rates was not going to provide much help.<ref name=":1" />

Recovery from what Blinder terms a Reinhart-Rogoff recession may require debt forgiveness, either directly, or implicitly through encouraging somewhat higher than normal rates of inflation.  "Not your father’s recovery policies," writes Blinder.<ref name=":1" />

== Criticism and controversy ==
In April 2013, Rogoff was at the center of worldwide attention with [[Carmen Reinhart]] (coauthor of the book ''This Time is Different'') when their widely cited study "[[Growth in a Time of Debt]]" was shown to contain computation errors which critics claim undermine its central thesis that too much debt causes recession.<ref name='Alexander01'>{{cite news | first = Ruth | last = Alexander | title = Reinhart, Rogoff... and Herndon: The student who caught out the profs | date = April 19, 2013 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22223190 | work = [[BBC News]] | access-date = April 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/how-much-unemployment-was-caused-by-reinhart-and-rogoffs-arithmetic-mistake |title=How Much Unemployment Was Caused by Reinhart and Rogoff's Arithmetic Mistake? |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] |date=April 16, 2013 |access-date=April 18, 2013}}</ref> An analysis by [[Thomas Herndon]], Michael Ash and [[Robert Pollin]] argued that "coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics led to serious errors that inaccurately represent the relationship between public debt and GDP growth among 20 advanced economies in the post-war period."<ref name="peri.umass.edu">{{cite journal|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP322.pdf |title=Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth?

His book ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly'', which he co-authored with [[Carmen Reinhart]], was released in October 2009.<ref name=rampell>{{citation |last=Rampell |first=Catherine |title=They Did Their Homework (800 Years of It) | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 4, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/business/economy/04econ.html?src=me&ref=homepage}}</ref>

In ''The Curse of Cash'', published in 2016, he urged that the United States phase out the 100-dollar bill, then the 50-dollar bill, then the 20-dollar bill, leaving only smaller denominations in circulation.<ref>{{cite web
