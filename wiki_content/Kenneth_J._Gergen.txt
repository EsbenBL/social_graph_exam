'''Kenneth J. Gergen''' (born 1935) is an [[United States|American]] social [[psychologist]] and [[emeritus]] [[professor]] at [[Swarthmore College]]. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Yale University]] (1957) and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Duke University]] (1962).

==Biography==

The son of [[John Jay Gergen]], the chair of the Mathematics Department at [[Duke University]], and Aubigne Munger (née Lermond), Gergen grew up in Durham, North Carolina. He had three brothers, one of whom is [[David Gergen]], the prominent political analyst. After completing public schooling, he attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1957, he subsequently became an officer in the U.S. Navy. He then returned to graduate school at Duke University, where he received his PhD in psychology in 1963. His dissertation advisor was [[Edward E. Jones]]. Gergen went on to become an assistant professor in the Department of Social Relations at [[Harvard University]], where he also became the chairman of the board of tutors and advisors for the department and representative to the university's Council on Educational Policy.

In 1967, Gergen took a position as chair of the Department of Psychology at [[Swarthmore College]], a position he held for ten years. Subsequently, he became the Gil and Frank Mustin Professor in Psychology. After his retirement (emeritus) in 2006, he took the position of Senior Research Professor. At various intervals, he served as visiting professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]], the [[University of Marburg]], the [[Sorbonne]], the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], [[Kyoto University]], and [[Adolfo Ibanez University]]. At Swarthmore, he spearheaded the development of the academic concentration in interpretation theory. In an attempt to link his academic work to societal practices, he collaborated with colleagues to create the Taos Institute in 1993. He now serves as the president of the institute.

Gergen is married to Mary M. Gergen, professor emeritus at [[Penn State University]], and a major contributor to [[feminist psychology]] and performance inquiry. She is the author of over 50 articles and is the co-author (with Ken Gergen) of books on social construction, and performative social science. They publish the Positive Aging Newsletter with a readership of around 20,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Kenneth J.

==Contributions==

Gergen's earliest studies challenged the presumption of a unified or coherent self.{{Clarify|reason=What studies, and in what way did they challenge this assumption?|date=June 2017}} He then raised questions about the value of [[altruism]], by exploring the ways in which helping others leads to the recipient's resentment and alienation. 

A major point in Gergen's career was his 1973 article "Social Psychology as History". In the article, he argues that while empirical research attempts to establish general laws or principles, the empirical support is always derived from historically situated observations. Yet, because patterns of human action undergo continuous change, support for any principle may wax or wane over time. Further, the scientific knowledge the laws and principles of social interaction are variable over time, and that the scientific knowledge generated by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] actually influences the phenomena it is meant to passively describe. For example, studying obedience to authority may reduce the likelihood of obedience. He argued therefore that social psychology was not fundamentally a cumulative science, but was effectively engaged in the recording and transformation of cultural life. The article proved widely controversial, and was ultimately listed as a "citation classic" in the &nbsp;''Social Science Citation Index.'' Also contributing to what was called "the crisis in social psychology"[3] was Gergen's subsequent publication on generative theory. Here he proposed that, because theoretical suppositions were not so much recordings of social life as creators, theories should not be judged so much by their integration of "what is" as their potential to open new spaces of action.

Combining these ideas with developments in literary and critical theory, along with the history of science, Gergen went on to develop a radical view of [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] knowledge. This view was proposed as a successor project to what Gergen considered an inherently flawed [[Positivism|positivist]] conception of knowledge.  From Gergen's perspective, all human intelligibility (including claims to knowledge) is generated within relationships. It is from relationships that humans derive their conceptions of what is real, rational, and good. From this perspective, scientific theories, like all other reality posits, should not be assessed in terms of truth, but in terms of pragmatic outcomes. Such assessments are inevitably wedded to values, and thus all science is morally and politically weighted in implication. As he saw it, this same form of assessment also applies to social constructionist theory. The question is not its accuracy, but its potentials for humankind.

This latter conclusion informed most of Gergen's subsequent work, in areas including therapy and counseling, education, organizational change, technology, conflict reduction, civil society, and qualitative inquiry. In one form or another, this work is concerned with transforming social life. For the most part, his preferred direction of change is toward more collaborative and participatory relationships. Additionally, he has been concerned with fostering a "[[relational psychoanalysis|relational]]" view of the self, where the "traditional emphasis on the individual mind is replaced by a concern with the relational processes from which rationality and morality emerge."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gergen, Kenneth J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/463309819|title=Relational being : beyond self and community|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971940-2|location=Oxford|oclc=463309819}}</ref> He is also known for his comment "I am linked therefore I am" as an answer to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' proposition "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]".<ref>Relational Being. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 400.</ref> Most of these developments are summarized in ''Relational Being, Beyond the Individual and Community,'' which attempts to demonstrate that what are considered mental processes are not so much "in the head" as in relationships. It also attempts to answer charges of [[moral relativism]] with a non-foundational morality of collaborative practice, and to outline a way to bring science together with concerns for the sacred.

The development of social constructionist, relational theory, and their professional applications is associated with relations between, ethics in a pluralistic world, qualitative inquiry in the social sciences,&nbsp;explanations of human action, and reconstructing the conception of ageing. He also served as a co-founder of the journals, ''Theory and Psychology'', and ''Qualitative Inquiry in Psychology''.

==Notable concepts==
Concepts that Gergen has written about include:
*''Enlightenment effects''. The moral and political effects on cultural behavior of disseminating scientific knowledge. ("Social psychology as history")
*''Generative theory'': Theory that unsettles common assumptions, and opens up possibilities or new forms of action. ("Toward generative theory")
*''Deficit discourse'': By constructing the world, and particularly individuals, in terms of problems, there is an objectification of deficit and a suppression of positive possibilities. (''Realities and Relationships'')
*''Cycle of progressive infirmity'': With the dissemination of information about [[Classification of mental disorders#Categorical schemes|categories of mental illness]], people come to see themselves in these terms. As a result, they seek help from the [[Mental health professional|mental health professions]], which are in turn, expanded in numbers. With the expansion of the mental health industry, new diagnostic categories are developed and disseminated. The society becomes progressively infirmed. (''Realities and Relationships'')
*''Multiphrenia'': The condition, largely attributed to technologies that increase social contact, of being simultaneously drawn in multiple and conflicting directions. (''The Saturated Self'')
*''Pregression''. To unsettle the modernist value placed on progress, the proposal that for every change that is effected in societal life, the repercussions will unsettle multiple conditions that people define as positive. (''The Saturated Self'')
*''Positive aging'': As an alternative to the pervasive view of aging as decline (deficit discourse), it is possible to discover and construct myriad ways of creating later life as a period of unparalleled growth and enrichment.
*''First and second order morality'': All collaborative relationships will be about some understanding of the good. With multiple groups proclaiming their own good, the stage is set for interminable conflict. Second order morality is achieved through practices that bring otherwise embattled groups into a condition of positive collaboration. (''Relational Being'')
*''Transformative dialogue'': Forms of dialogic practice that dissolve the barriers of meaning separating otherwise conflicted parties. (''Relational Being'')
*''Co-action''. One's actions have no meaning in themselves, but come into meaning through another's collaborative action. At the same time, another's potentially collaborative actions only become so as they are supplemented. All human intelligibility emerges not from individual actors but through co-action. (''Relational Being'')
*''Multi-being''. What is commonly viewed as the individual subject is the common intersection of multiple relationships. (''Relational Being'')
*''Future forming research''. In a world of increasingly rapid change, research focused on what is currently the case rapidly loses relevance. As a result, research should shift its emphasis to creating the future. Action research is illustrative.

==Awards==
