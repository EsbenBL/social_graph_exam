'''Yoram Barzel''' (born 1931) is an [[Israel]]i economist and a professor in the Department of Economics at the [[University of Washington]]. He is interested in [[property]] [[rights]], applied price theory, and [[political economy]].

== Education ==
Barzel graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (1953) and [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1956) in economics from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He completed his [[Ph.D.]] in economics from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1961. He specializes in [[price theory]] and [[economic]] [[organization]].

== Research ==
Barzel is known for developing a property rights/[[transaction cost]] approach to economics and he has written on topics ranging from car racing to slavery to Jewish lending to voting rules in condominium associations. Among his many ideas are those about racing to claim assets, [[Human multitasking|multitasking]], [[rationing]] by waiting, divided ownership of complex assets, measurement costs, and the economic origins of [[democracy]]. In the process Barzel's work unearthed the economic rationale for many institutions and offered a framework for analyzing them. Barzel holds an important place among all economists for expanding the scope of economic science in a way that focuses attention on the importance of institutions and the economic logic of their variety.
