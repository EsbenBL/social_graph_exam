In addition to the Ainu, he conducted research on the [[Orok people|Orork]] and [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]] [[indigenous people]] of [[Sakhalin]] island.

==Early life==
Piłsudski was born on November 2, 1866 in the [[Vilna Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] in present-day [[Lithuania]]. He was one of four brothers, including [[Józef Piłsudski|Józef]], [[Adam Piłsudski|Adam]], and [[Jan Piłsudski|Jan]]. Józef later served as the [[Chief of State (Poland)|Chief of State]] and [[Marshal of Poland|First Marshal]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. Bronisław and Józef Piłsudski moved to [[Vilnius]] in 1874, where they continued self-education for three years. After their mother's death in 1886, they left together for [[Saint Petersburg]]. Bronisław Piłsudski passed an examination at a local university.  

== Exile ==
For his involvement with a [[socialism|socialist]] in a plot to assassinate Alexander III of Russia in 1887 together with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s brother [[Aleksandr Ulyanov]], Bronisław was sentenced to fifteen years at hard labor on Sakhalin island (Ulyanov was hanged). He used his time there to conduct research. While on Sakhalin in 1891, he met ethnographer [[Lev Sternberg]]. Piłsudski was then sent to the island's southern part. The rest of his prison sentence was changed to ten years of internal exile because he had settled without permission of the Russian authorities.

=== Research of the Ainu people ===
Three years later, Piłsudski was given a grant by the Imperial [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] to study the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. That year he settled in an Ainu village, fell in love with an Ainu woman, Chufsanma, officially married her and had a son and daughter, Sukezo and Kiyo, with her. His wife was a niece of Chief Bafunkei of the village of Ai in Sakhalin. In 1903 he recorded the [[Ainu language]]. From these original recordings an Ainu dictionary of over a thousand words was made, which was translated into over ten languages.  Piłsudski also wrote down the myths, culture, music and customs of the Ainu. He built an elementary school in the village where he taught [[Russian language]] and [[mathematics]] to the local children. The schools were open only in winter, the slack season of the farm.

In 1904, the [[Russo-Japanese War]] broke out. Due to the rumor that if one spoke Russian they would be conscripted to the Russian Army, the locals began refusing to learn Russian. Also, Ainus were prepared to cooperate with the Japanese after they landed on Sakhalin. A local told Piłsudski that he would not send his son to the school. Chief Bafunkei told Piłsudski to return to Poland while the war continued. Piłsudski reluctantly agreed with him.[[File:Sakhalin Ainu Man.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A [[Sakhalin]] mixed-blood [[Ainu people|Ainu]]-[[Russians|Russian]] man, photographed by Bronisław Piłsudski ca. 1905]]

Piłsudski moved to Japan by himself, where he was befriended by [[Ōkuma Shigenobu]], [[Futabatei Shimei]], [[Torii Ryūzō]], [[Sen Katayama|Katayama Sen]], and others, and helped an organization of anti-imperial Russian refugees. Among them, Futabatei Shimei became Piłsudski's very close friend. He described Bronisław as:<blockquote>an 'odd ball' who was so kind-hearted and innocent like a child that he would always insist in a very excited tone that he needed to do something to help Ainus and that it was his destiny to do that despite the fact that he was always a 'complete broke' then".<ref>{{in lang|ja}} [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no5/inoue.pdf]</ref></blockquote>In the same year, Piłsudski arrived in [[Kraków]], [[Austria-Hungary]], after traveling from Japan via the [[United States]]. 

== World War I ==
When there was upheaval preceding [[World War I]], Piłsudski escaped to [[Switzerland]]. In 1917 he left for [[Paris]], where he worked at the Paris office of [[Polish National Committee (1914–1917)|Polish National Committee]], which had been founded by [[Roman Dmowski]], the political archrival of Bronisław's younger brother Józef.

On 17 May 1918 Piłsudski drowned in the [[Seine]] River near the [[Pont Neuf]]. On 21 May 1918 his body was found near the [[Pont Mirabeau]]. His death was thought to be a suicide.

Piłsudski's descendants currently live in Japan.<ref>{{in lang|ja}} [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no5/inoue.pdf]</ref>
