'''Shlomo S. Sawilowsky''' was [[professor]] of educational statistics and Distinguished Faculty Fellow at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan, where he has received teaching, mentoring, and research awards.<ref>[http://www.otl.wayne.edu/awardsWSU/aw-pe.html 1994 WSU President's Award For Excellence In Teaching; 1997 College of Education Excellence in Teaching Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106104005/http://www.otl.wayne.edu/awardsWSU/aw-pe.html |date=2008-11-06 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gradschool.wayne.edu/GradCouncil/archives/97-98/98-03-25min.pdf 1998 WSU Outstanding Graduate Mentor Award]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100627233059/http://www.coe.wayne.edu/COE/pdf_files/08-09-Educator-v4.pdf 2000 - 2002 WSU Distinguished Faculty Fellow.]</ref>

==Academic career==
Sawilowsky obtained his [[Ph.D.]] in 1985 at the [[University of South Florida]]. He was inducted into the USF chapter of the [[Phi Kappa Phi]] honor society on May 17, 1981,<ref>''Who's Who in American Education'', 1990, ''II'', 608. National Reference Institute.</ref> when he received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]]<ref name="coe.wayne.edu">{{cite web|url=http://coe.wayne.edu/faculty-staff/bio.php?id=60321|title=Profile View - College of Education - Wayne State University|date=11 May 2021}}</ref> In 2008 Sawilowsky served as president of the [[American Educational Research Association]] Special Interest Group/Educational Statisticians. He served as an Assistant Dean in the College of Education at WSU. Along with Miodrag Lovric (Serbia) and [[C. R. Rao]] (India), he was nominated for the 2013 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his contributions to the [[International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science]].<ref>http://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/lista/pdfcFHNhReNSn.pdf</ref>

==Contributions to applied statistics and social/behavioral sciences==
In 2000, the ''AMSTAT News'', a publication of the [[American Statistical Association]], described Professor Sawilowsky's award of Distinguished Faculty Fellow "in recognition of Sawilowsky's outstanding scholarly achievements in applied statistics, psychometrics, and experimental design in education and psychology."<ref>''Amstat News'', May, 2000, p. 26.</ref>

===Applied statistics===
He is the author of a statistics textbook that presents statistical methods via Monte Carlo simulation methods,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sawilowsky |first1=Shlomo S. |last2=Fahoome |first2=Gail C. |year=2003 |title=''Statistics via Monte Carlo Simulation with Fortran'' |publisher=Rochester Hills, MI: JMASM |isbn=978-0-9740236-0-1}}</ref> editor of a volume on real data analysis published by the [[American Educational Research Association]] SIG/Educational Statisticians,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sawilowsky |first1=Shlomo S.

Sawilowsky has also authored 24 entries in statistics encyclopedias.

His presentation titled "The Rank Transform," with co-author R. Clifford Blair, was awarded the 1985 Florida Educational Research Association & 1986 American Educational Research Association State/Regions Distinguished Paper Award.<ref name="coe.wayne.edu"/> Many of his publications are related to [[Ranking#Ranking in statistics|rank-based]] [[nonparametric statistics]]. For example, an examination of the robustness and comparative power properties of the rank transform statistic<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sawilowsky |first1=Shlomo S. |last2=Blair |first2=R.

==Rabbinical studies and contributions to the Judaica literature==
After graduating from the [[Rabbinical College of America]] in 1979, Sawilowsky was the emissary of the Grand Rabbi of Lubavitch, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], to [[Pinellas County, Florida]].<ref>Rabbi Yosef B.
