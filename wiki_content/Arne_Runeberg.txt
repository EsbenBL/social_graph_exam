'''Sven Arne Runeberg''' (7 April 1912 — 15 November 1979) was a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]], best known for his studies on [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[witchcraft]], and [[sociolinguistics]].

Arne Runeberg was born in [[Helsinki]] into the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] cultural family Runeberg; his great grandfather was Finland's national poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg|J. L. Runeberg]]. Arne Runeberg attained his B.A. degree at the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1939, but [[World War II]] made a stop to his postgraduate studies. In 1947, however, he was the first student to defend his doctoral thesis, ''Witches, Demons and Fertility Magic'', at the new Faculty of Social Sciences in Helsinki University.

Representing [[evolutionary anthropology]], Arne Runeberg was trained by two students of [[Edvard Westermarck]], namely [[Gunnar Landtman]] and [[Rafael Karsten]].

After his doctoral degree, Arne Runeberg had a versatile career at several colleges in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[the United Kingdom]], including [[London School of Economics]] (1961) and [[Umeå Social College]] (1964–1971). The last tenure was at his ''alma mater'', as he was appointed the associate professor of [[social anthropology]] in Helsinki (1971–1979).

In addition to his doctoral thesis, Arne Runeberg wrote two substantial studies: ''Jesu korsfästelse i religionshistorisk belysning'' (1952) situates [[Jesus Christ]] in a long tradition of so-called [[carnival]] kings, and ''Some Observations on Linguistic Patterns in a Bilingual Society'' (1951–1954) discusses [[Multilingualism|bilinguality]]. Runeberg himself was a bilingual Finn ''par excellence'', using both [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

Arne Runeberg died in Helsinki, aged 67, soon after he was retired from the University.
