'''<span lang="gu" dir="rtl">Edward</span> Hallett '''"'''Ted'''"''' Carr''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FBA}} (28 June 1892 – 3 November 1982) was a historian, diplomat, journalist and [[international relations]] theorist, and an opponent of [[empiricism]] within [[historiography]]. Carr was best known for ''[[A History of Soviet Russia]]'', a 14-volume history of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1917 to 1929, for his writings on international relations, particularly ''[[The Twenty Years' Crisis]]'', and for his book ''[[What Is History?]]'' in which he laid out historiographical principles rejecting traditional historical methods and practices.

Educated at the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]], London, and then at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], Carr began his career as a diplomat in 1916; three years later, he participated at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] as a member of the British delegation.  Becoming increasingly preoccupied with the study of international relations and of the [[Soviet Union]], he resigned from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] in 1936 to begin an academic career. From 1941 to 1946, Carr worked as an assistant editor at ''The Times'', where he was noted for his leaders (editorials) urging a socialist system and an Anglo-Soviet alliance as the basis of a post-war order.

== Early life ==
Carr was born in London to a middle-class family, and was educated at the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] in London and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was awarded a First Class Degree in [[Classics]] in 1916.<ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie p. 24">Hughes-Warrington, p. 24</ref><ref name="ReferenceB"/> Carr's family had originated in northern England, and the first mention of his ancestors was a George Carr who served as the Sheriff of Newcastle in 1450.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Carr's parents were Francis Parker and Jesse (née Hallet) Carr.<ref name="ReferenceB">Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 475</ref> They were initially [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], but went over to supporting the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1903 over the issue of [[free trade]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/> When [[Joseph Chamberlain]] proclaimed his opposition to free trade and announced in favour of [[Imperial Preference]], Carr's father, to whom all [[tariff]]s were abhorrent, switched his political loyalties.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Carr described the atmosphere at the Merchant Taylors School: "95% of my school fellows came from orthodox Conservative homes, and regarded [[Lloyd George]] as an incarnation of the devil. We Liberals were a tiny despised minority."<ref name=autogenerated5>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 476</ref> From his parents, Carr inherited a strong belief in progress as an unstoppable force in world affairs, and throughout his life a recurring theme in Carr's thinking was that the world was progressively becoming a better place.<ref name="Haslam p. 36">Haslam, "We Need a Faith", p. 36</ref> In 1911, Carr won the Craven Scholarship to attend Trinity College at Cambridge.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> At Cambridge, Carr was much impressed by hearing one of his professors lecture on how the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] influenced [[Herodotus]] in the writing of the [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']].<ref name="Haslam p. 39">Haslam, "We Need a Faith", p. 39</ref> Carr found this to be a great discovery—the subjectivity of the historian's craft. This discovery was later to influence his 1961 book ''What Is History?''<ref name="Haslam p. 39"/>

== Diplomatic career ==
Like many of his generation, Carr found World War I to be a shattering experience as it destroyed the world he had known before 1914.<ref name="Haslam p. 36"/> He joined the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] in 1916, resigning in 1936.<ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie p. 24" /> Carr was excused from military service for medical reasons.<ref name="Haslam p. 36"/> He was at first assigned to the Contraband Department of the Foreign Office, which sought to enforce the blockade on Germany, and then in 1917 was assigned to the Northern Department, which amongst other areas dealt with relations with Russia.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> As a diplomat, Carr was later praised by the Foreign Secretary [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] as someone who had "distinguished himself not only by sound learning and political understanding, but also in administrative ability".<ref name="d481"/>

At first, Carr knew nothing about the Bolsheviks. He later recalled of having some "vague impression of the revolutionary views of Lenin and Trotsky" but of knowing nothing of Marxism.<ref name="Davies p. 477">Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 477</ref> By 1919, Carr had become convinced that the [[Bolshevik]]s were destined to win the [[Russian Civil War]], and approved of the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]'s opposition to the anti-Bolshevik ideas of the War Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] on the grounds of ''[[realpolitik]]''.<ref name="Davies p. 477"/> He later wrote that in the spring of 1919 he "was disappointed when he [Lloyd George] gave way (in part) on the Russian question in order to buy French consent to concessions to Germany".<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 30</ref> In 1919, Carr was part of the British delegation at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and was involved in the drafting of parts of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] relating to the [[League of Nations]].<ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie p. 24"/> During the conference, Carr was much offended at the Allied, especially French, treatment of the Germans, writing that the German delegation at the peace conference were "cheated over the 'Fourteen Points', and subjected to every petty humiliation".<ref name="Davies p. 477"/> Beside working on the sections of the Versailles treaty relating to the League of Nations, Carr was also involved in working out the borders between Germany and Poland. Initially, Carr favoured Poland, urging in a memo in February 1919 that Britain recognise Poland at once, and that the German city of [[Danzig]] (modern [[Gdańsk]], Poland) be ceded to Poland.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 28</ref> In March 1919, Carr fought against the idea of a [[Little Treaty of Versailles|Minorities Treaty]] for Poland, arguing that the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in Poland would be best guaranteed by not involving the international community in Polish internal affairs.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 27</ref> By the spring of 1919, Carr's relations with the Polish delegation had declined to a state of mutual hostility.<ref name="Haslam, p. 29">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 29</ref> Carr's tendency to favour the claims of the Germans at the expense of the Poles led [[Adam Zamoyski]] to note that Carr "held views of the most extraordinary racial arrogance on all of the nations of Eastern Europe".<ref>Zamoyski, Adam ''The Polish Way'', London: John Murray, 1989 p. 335</ref> Carr's biographer, Jonathan Haslam, wrote that Carr grew up in a place where German culture was deeply appreciated, which in turn always coloured his views towards Germany throughout his life.<ref name="Haslam, pp. 21-35"/> As a result, Carr supported the territorial claims of the ''Reich'' against Poland. In a letter written in 1954 to his friend [[Isaac Deutscher]], Carr described his attitude to Poland at the time: "The picture of Poland that was universal in Eastern Europe right down to 1925 was of a strong and potentially predatory power."<ref name="Haslam, p. 29"/>

After the peace conference, Carr was stationed at the British Embassy in Paris until 1921, and in 1920 was awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/> At first, Carr had great faith in the League, which he believed would prevent both another world war and ensure a better post-war world.<ref name="Haslam p. 36"/> In the 1920s, Carr was assigned to the branch of the British Foreign Office that dealt with the [[League of Nations]] before being sent to the British Embassy in [[Riga]], Latvia, where he served as Second Secretary between 1925 and 1929.<ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie p. 24"/> In 1925, Carr married Anne Ward Howe, by whom he had one son.<ref name=Cobb180>Cobb, Adam "Carr, E.H." pp. 180–181 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 1, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999 p. 180</ref> During his time in Riga (which at that time possessed a substantial Russian émigré community), Carr became increasingly fascinated with Russian literature and culture and wrote several works on various aspects of Russian life.<ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie p. 24"/> Carr learnt Russian during his time in Riga, to read Russian writers in the original.<ref>Haslam, "We Need a Faith", pp. 36–37</ref> In 1927, Carr paid his first visit to Moscow.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> He was later to write that reading [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and the work of other 19th-century Russian intellectuals caused him to re-think his liberal views.<ref name="Deutscher pp. 78">{{Cite journal | last = Deutscher | first = Tamara | author-link = Tamara Deutscher | title = E.

S. Mirsky]], a Russian émigré scholar living at that time in Britain.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'' p. 41-42</ref> Beside studies on [[international relations]], Carr's writings in the 1930s included biographies of Dostoyevsky (1931), [[Karl Marx]] (1934), and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1937). An early sign of Carr's increasing admiration of the Soviet Union was a 1929 review of Baron [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Pyotr Wrangel]]'s memoirs.<ref>[[Davies, R.W.]] "Carr's Changing Views of the Soviet Union" pp. 91–108 from ''E.H. Carr A Critical Appraisal'' ed. Michael Cox, London: Palgrave, 2000 p. 95</ref>

In an article entitled "Age of Reason" published in the ''Spectator'' on 26 April 1930, Carr attacked what he regarded as the prevailing culture of pessimism within the West, which he blamed on the French writer [[Marcel Proust]].<ref name="Haslam, p. 47">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 47</ref> In the early 1930s, Carr found the [[Great Depression]] to be almost as profoundly shocking as the First World War.<ref name="Haslam p. 37">Haslam, "We Need a Faith", p. 37</ref> Further increasing Carr's interest in a replacement ideology for liberalism was his reaction to hearing the debates in January 1931 at the General Assembly of the League of Nations in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, and especially the speeches on the merits of free trade between the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vojislav Marinkovich and the British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Henderson]].<ref name=d481>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 481</ref> It was at this time that Carr started to admire the Soviet Union.<ref name="Haslam p. 37"/> In a 1932 book review of [[Lancelot Lawton]]'s ''Economic History of Soviet Russia'', Carr dismissed Lawton's claim that the Soviet economy was a failure, and praised the British Marxist economist [[Maurice Dobb]]'s extremely favourable assessment of the Soviet economy.<ref name="Davies, R.W pp. 91-108">[[Davies, R.W.]] "Carr's Changing Views of the Soviet Union" pp. 91–108 from ''E.H. Carr: A Critical Appraisal'' ed. Michael Cox, London: Palgrave, 2000 p. 98</ref>

Carr's early political outlook was anti-Marxist and liberal.<ref>Laqueur, pp. 112–113</ref> In his 1934 biography of Marx, Carr presented his subject as a highly intelligent man and a gifted writer, but one whose talents were devoted entirely to destruction.<ref name=L113>Laqueur, p. 113</ref> Carr argued that Marx's sole and only motivation was a mindless class hatred.<ref name=L113/> Carr labelled [[dialectical materialism]] gibberish, and the labour theory of value doctrinal and derivative.<ref name=L113/> He praised Marx for emphasising the importance of the collective over the individual.<ref>Halliday, Fred, "Reason and Romance: The Place of Revolution in the Works of E.H. Carr", pp. 258–279 from ''E.H. Carr A Critical Appraisal'' ed. Michael Cox, London: Palgrave, 2000 p. 262</ref> In view of his later conversion to a sort of quasi-Marxism, Carr was to find the passages in ''Karl Marx: A Study in Fanaticism'' criticising Marx to be highly embarrassing, and refused to allow the book to be republished.<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", pp. 478–479</ref> Carr was to later call it his worst book, and complained that he had written it only because his publisher had made a Marx biography a precondition for publishing the biography of Bakunin that he was writing.<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 478</ref> In his books such as ''The Romantic Exiles'' and ''Dostoevsky'', Carr was noted for his highly ironical treatment of his subjects, implying that their lives were of interest but not of great importance.<ref>Laqueur, p. 112</ref> In the mid-1930s, Carr was especially preoccupied with the life and ideas of Bakunin.<ref name="Davies p. 479">Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 479</ref> During this period, Carr started writing a novel about the visit of a Bakunin-type Russian radical to Victorian Britain who proceeded to expose all of what Carr regarded as the pretensions and hypocrisies of British bourgeois society.<ref name="Davies p. 479"/> The novel was never finished or published.<ref name="Davies p. 479"/>

As a diplomat in the 1930s, Carr took the view that great division of the world into rival trading blocs caused by the American [[Smoot–Hawley Act]] of 1930 was the principal cause of German belligerence in foreign policy, as Germany was now unable to export finished goods or import raw materials cheaply. In Carr's opinion, if Germany could be given its own economic zone to dominate in Eastern Europe{{mdash}}comparable to the British Imperial preference economic zone, the US dollar zone in the Americas, the French gold bloc zone, and the Japanese economic zone{{mdash}}then the peace of the world could be assured.<ref name="Haslam, p. 59"/> In an essay published in February 1933 in the ''Fortnightly Review'', Carr blamed what he regarded as a punitive Versailles treaty for the recent accession to power of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name="Haslam, p. 59">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 59</ref> Carr's views on appeasement caused much tension with his superior, the Permanent Undersecretary Sir [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], and played a role in Carr's resignation from the Foreign Office later in 1936.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', pp. 59–60</ref> In an article entitled "An English Nationalist Abroad" published in May 1936 in the ''Spectator'', Carr wrote: "The methods of the Tudor sovereigns, when they were making the English nation, invite many comparisons with those of the Nazi regime in Germany".<ref name="Haslam, p. 79">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 79</ref> In this way, Carr argued that it was hypocritical for people in Britain to criticise the Nazi regime's human rights record.<ref name="Haslam, p. 79"/> Because of Carr's strong antagonism to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which he viewed as unjust to Germany, Carr was very supportive of the Nazi regime's efforts to destroy Versailles through moves such as the [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland]] in 1936.<ref name=d483>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 483</ref> Of his views in the 1930s, Carr later wrote: "No doubt, I was very blind."<ref name=d483/>

== International relations scholar ==
In 1936, Carr became the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics at the [[Aberystwyth University|University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]], and is particularly known for his contribution on [[international relations theory]]. Carr's last words of advice as a diplomat were a memo urging that Britain accept the [[Balkans]] as an exclusive zone of influence for Germany.<ref name="Haslam p. 37"/> Additionally, in articles published in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' on 2 December 1936 and in the January 1937 edition of ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'', Carr argued that the Soviet Union and France were not working for [[collective security]] but rather "a division of the Great Powers into two armored camps", supported non-intervention in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and asserted that King [[Leopold III of Belgium]] had made a major step towards peace with his declaration of neutrality of 14 October 1936.<ref name="Davies pp. 473">Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 484</ref> Two major intellectual influences on Carr in the mid-1930s were [[Karl Mannheim]]'s 1936 book ''Ideology and Utopia'', and the work of [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] on the need to combine morality with realism.<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", pp. 481–482</ref>

Carr's appointment as the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics caused a stir when he started to use his position to criticise the [[League of Nations]], a viewpoint which caused much tension with his benefactor, [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|Lord Davies]], who was a strong supporter of the League.<ref name="Porter pp. 36-67">Porter, pp. 50–51</ref> Lord Davies had established the Wilson Chair in 1924 with the intention of increasing public support for his beloved League, which helps to explain his chagrin at Carr's anti-League lectures.<ref name="Porter pp. 36-67"/> In his first lecture on 14 October 1936 Carr stated that the League was ineffective.<ref name=porter51>Porter, p. 51</ref>

In 1936, Carr began to work for [[Chatham House]], where he chaired a study group tasked with producing a report on nationalism. The report was published in 1939.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Michael|date=2021-01-11|title=E. H.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S33882, Adolf Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In the 1930s, Carr saw [[Adolf Hitler]] as a leader of a "have-not" nation struggling for economic justice and considered ''[[Lebensraum]]'' a zone of economic influence for Germany in Eastern Europe]]
In 1937, Carr visited the Soviet Union for a second time, and was impressed by what he saw.<ref name="Davies.

[http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/nastiness-prycejones-2770 "Unlimited nastiness"]. ''The New Criterion''. Retrieved 30 March 2020.</ref> As part of the same trip that took Carr to the Soviet Union in 1937 was a visit to Germany. In a speech given on 12 October 1937 at Chatham House summarising his impressions of those two countries, Carr reported that Germany was "almost a free country".<ref name="Haslam, p. 78">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 78</ref> Apparently unaware of the fate of Prince Mirsky, Carr spoke of the "strange behaviour" of his old friend, who had at first gone to great lengths to try to pretend that he did not know Carr during their accidental meeting.<ref name="Haslam, p. 78"/>

In the 1930s, Carr was a leading supporter of [[appeasement]].<ref name="Laqueur, Walter pp. 113-114">Laqueur, pp. 113–114</ref> In his writings on international affairs in British newspapers, Carr criticised the Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Beneš]] for clinging to the alliance with France, rather than accepting that it was his country's destiny to be in the German sphere of influence.<ref name="Davies pp. 473"/> At the same time, Carr strongly praised the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel [[Józef Beck]] for his balancing act between France, Germany, and the Soviet Union.<ref name="Davies pp. 473"/> In the late 1930s, Carr started to become even more sympathetic toward the Soviet Union, as he was much impressed by the achievements of the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], which stood in marked contrast to the failures of capitalism during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="Deutscher pp. 78"/>

His famous work ''[[The Twenty Years' Crisis]]'' was published in July 1939, which dealt with the subject of international relations between 1919 and 1939. In that book, Carr defended appeasement on the ground that it was the only realistic policy option.<ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 114">Laqueur, p. 114</ref> At the time the book was published in the summer of 1939, [[Neville Chamberlain]] had adopted his "containment" policy towards Germany, leading Carr to later ruefully comment that his book was dated even before it was published. In the spring and summer of 1939, Carr was very dubious about Chamberlain's "guarantee" of Polish independence issued on 31 March 1939.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', pp. 79–80</ref>

[[File:Norman Angell 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In his 1939 book ''The Twenty Years' Crisis'', Carr attacked [[Norman Angell]] as a utopian thinker on international relations]]
In ''The Twenty Year's Crisis'', Carr divided thinkers on international relations into two schools, which he labelled the utopians and the realists.<ref name=L113/> Reflecting his own disillusion with the League of Nations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/?p=4915|title=E.H Carr and The Failure of the League of Nations|work=E-International Relations}}</ref> Carr attacked as "utopians" those like [[Norman Angell]] who believed that a new and better international structure could be built around the League. In Carr's opinion, the entire international order constructed at Versailles was flawed and the League was a hopeless dream that could never do anything practical.<ref>Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, pp. 68–69</ref> Carr described the opposition of utopianism and realism in international relations as a dialectic progress.<ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 115">Laqueur, p. 115</ref> He argued that in realism there is no moral dimension, so that for a realist what is successful is right and what is unsuccessful is wrong.<ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 114"/>

Carr contended that international relations was an incessant struggle between the economically privileged "have" powers and the economically disadvantaged "have not" powers.<ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 114"/> In this economic understanding of international relations, "have" powers like the United States, Britain and France were inclined to avoid war because of their contented status whereas "have not" powers like Germany, Italy and Japan were inclined towards war as they had nothing to lose.<ref name=j29>Jones, Charles ''E.H. Carr and International Relations: A Duty to Lie'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998 p. 29</ref> Carr defended the [[Munich Agreement]] as the overdue recognition of changes in the balance of power.<ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 114"/> In ''The Twenty Years' Crisis'', he was highly critical of [[Winston Churchill]], whom Carr described as a mere opportunist interested only in power for himself.<ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 114"/>

Carr immediately followed up ''The Twenty Year's Crisis'' with ''Britain: A Study of Foreign Policy From The Versailles Treaty to the Outbreak of War'', a study of British foreign policy in the inter-war period that featured a preface by the Foreign Secretary, [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]. Carr ended his support for appeasement, which he had so vociferously expressed in ''The Twenty Year's Crisis'', with a favourable review of a book containing a collection of Churchill's speeches from 1936 to 1938, which Carr wrote were "justifiably" alarmist about Germany.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 80</ref> After 1939, Carr largely abandoned writing about international relations in favour of contemporary events and [[History of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union (1917–1927)|Soviet history]]. Carr was to write only three more books about international relations after 1939, namely ''The Future of Nations; Independence Or Interdependence?'' (1941), ''German-Soviet Relations Between the Two World Wars, 1919–1939'' (1951) and ''International Relations Between the Two World Wars, 1919–1939'' (1955). After the outbreak of World War II, Carr stated that he had been somewhat mistaken in his prewar views on Nazi Germany.<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", pp. 48–484</ref> In the 1946 revised edition of ''The Twenty Years' Crisis'', Carr was more hostile in his appraisal of German foreign policy than he had been in the first edition in 1939.

Some of the major themes of Carr's writings were change and the relationship between ideational and material forces in society.<ref name=Cobb180/> He saw as a major theme of history the growth of [[reason]] as a social force.<ref name=Cobb180/> He argued that all major social changes had been caused by revolutions or wars, both of which Carr regarded as necessary but unpleasant means of accomplishing social change.<ref name=Cobb180/>

== World War II ==
During World War II, Carr's political views took a sharp turn towards the left.<ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 115"/> He spent the [[Phoney War]] working as a clerk with the propaganda department of the [[Foreign Office]].<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', pp. 80–82</ref> As Carr did not believe that Britain could defeat Germany, the declaration of war on Germany on 3 September 1939 left him highly depressed.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 81</ref>

In March 1940, Carr resigned from the Foreign Office to serve as the writer of leaders (editorials) for ''[[The Times]]''.<ref name="Haslam, p. 84">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 84</ref> In his second leader, published on 21 June 1940 and entitled "The German Dream", Carr wrote that Hitler was offering a "Europe united by conquest".<ref name="Haslam, p. 84"/> In a leader during the summer of 1940, Carr supported the Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic States]].<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 93</ref>

Carr served as the assistant editor of ''[[The Times]]'' from 1941 to 1946, during which time he was well known for the pro-Soviet attitudes that he expressed in his leaders.<ref>Beloff, Max "The Dangers of Prophecy" pp. 8–10 from ''History Today'', Volume 42, Issue # 9, September 1992 p. 9</ref> After June 1941, Carr' s already strong admiration for the Soviet Union was much increased by the Soviet Union's role in defeating Germany.<ref name="Deutscher pp. 78"/>

In a leader of 5 December 1940 entitled "The Two Scourges", Carr wrote that only by removing the "scourge" of unemployment could one also remove the "scourge" of war.<ref name=d487>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 487</ref> Such was the popularity of "The Two Scourges" that it was published as a pamphlet in December 1940, during which its first print run of 10,000 completely sold out.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 90</ref> Carr's left-wing leaders caused some tension with the editor of the ''Times'', [[Geoffrey Dawson]], who felt that Carr was taking the ''Times'' in too radical a direction, which led to Carr being restricted for a time to writing only on foreign policy.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', pp. 90–91</ref> After Dawson was ousted in May 1941 and replacemed with [[Robert M'Gowan Barrington-Ward]], Carr was given a free rein to write on whatever he wished. In turn, Barrington-Ward was to find many of Carr's leaders on foreign affairs to be too radical for his liking.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', pp. 91–93</ref>

Carr's leaders were noted for their advocacy of a socialist European economy under the control of an international planning board, and for his support for the idea of an Anglo-Soviet alliance as the basis of the post-war international order.<ref name="Haslam p. 37"/> Unlike many of his contemporaries in war-time Britain, Carr was against a [[Carthaginian peace]] with Germany, and argued for a post-war reconstruction of Germany along socialist lines.<ref name=Cobb180/><ref name="Haslam, p. 100">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 100</ref> In his leaders on foreign affairs, Carr was very consistent in arguing after 1941 that, once the war ended, it was the fate of Eastern Europe to come into the Soviet sphere of influence, and claimed that any effort to the contrary was both vain and immoral.<ref name="Davies p. 488">Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 488</ref>

Between 1942 and 1945, Carr was the Chairman of a study group at the [[Chatham House|Royal Institute of International Affairs]] concerned with Anglo-Soviet relations.<ref>Beloff, Max "The Dangers of Prophecy" pp. 8–10 from ''History Today'', Volume 42, Issue # 9, September 1992 p. 8</ref> Carr's study group concluded that Stalin had largely abandoned Communist ideology in favour of Russian nationalism, that the Soviet economy would provide a higher standard of living in the Soviet Union after the war, and that it was both possible and desirable for Britain to reach a friendly understanding with the Soviets once the war had ended.<ref>Beloff, Max "The Dangers of Prophecy" pp. 8–10 from ''History Today'', Volume 42, Issue # 9, September 1992 pp. 9–10</ref> In 1942, Carr published ''[[Conditions of Peace]]'', followed by ''[[Nationalism and After]]'' in 1945, in which he outlined his ideas about how the post-war world should look.<ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie p. 24"/> In his books, and his ''Times'' leaders, Carr urged for the creation of a socialist European federation anchored by an Anglo-German partnership that would be aligned with the Soviet Union against the United States.<ref name="Davies pp. 473-511">Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 489</ref>

In his 1942 book ''Conditions of Peace'', Carr argued that it was a flawed economic system that had caused World War II and that the only way of preventing another world war was for the Western powers to adopt socialism.<ref name=Cobb180/> One of the main sources for ideas in ''Conditions of Peace'' was the 1940 book ''Dynamics of War and Revolution'' by the American [[Lawrence Dennis]].<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 97</ref> In a review of ''Conditions of Peace'', the British writer [[Rebecca West]] criticised Carr for using Dennis as a source, commenting: "It is as odd for a serious English writer to quote Sir Oswald Mosley".<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 99</ref> In a speech on 2 June 1942 in the [[House of Lords]], [[Gideon Oliphant-Murray, 2nd Viscount Elibank|Viscount Elibank]] attacked Carr as an "active danger" for his views in ''Conditions of Peace'' about a magnanimous peace with Germany and for suggesting that Britain turn over all of her colonies to an international commission after the war.<ref name="Haslam, p. 100"/>

The next month, Carr's relations with the Polish government were further worsened by the storm caused by the discovery of the [[Katyn massacre]] committed by the Russian [[NKVD]] in 1940. In a leader entitled "Russia and Poland" on 28 April 1943, Carr blasted the Polish government for accusing the Soviets of committing the Katyn massacre and for asking the [[Red Cross]] to investigate.<ref name="Haslam, p. 104">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 104</ref>

[[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|Lord Davies]], who had been extremely unhappy with Carr almost from the moment that Carr had assumed the Wilson Chair in 1936, launched a major campaign in 1943 to have Carr fired, being particularly upset that, although Carr had not taught since 1939, he was still drawing his professor's salary.<ref>Porter, pp. 57–58</ref> Lord Davies's efforts to have Carr fired failed when a majority of the Aberystwyth staff, supported by the powerful Welsh political fixer [[Thomas Jones (T. J.)|Thomas Jones]], sided with Carr.<ref>Porter, p. 60</ref>

In December 1944, when fighting broke out in [[Athens]] between the Greek Communist front organisation [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] and the [[British Army]], Carr in a ''Times'' leader sided with the Greek Communists, leading to [[Winston Churchill]] to condemn him in a speech to the House of Commons.<ref name="Davies pp. 473-511"/> Carr claimed that the Greek [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] was the "largest organised party or group of parties in Greece", which "appeared to exercise almost unchallengeable authority", and called for Britain to recognise the EAM as the legal Greek government.<ref name="Conquest p. 33">Conquest, Robert "Agit-Prof" pp. 32–38 from ''The New Republic'', Volume 424, Issue # 4, 1 November 1999 p. 33</ref>

In contrast to his support for EAM/ELAS, Carr was strongly critical of the legitimate Polish government in exile and its [[Armia Krajowa]] (Home Army) resistance organisation.<ref name="Conquest p. 33"/> In his leaders of 1944 on Poland, Carr urged that Britain break diplomatic relations with the [[Polish government-in-exile|London government]] and recognise the Soviet-sponsored [[Polish Committee of National Liberation|Lublin government]] as the lawful government of Poland.<ref name="Conquest p. 33"/>

In a May 1945 leader, Carr blasted those who felt that an Anglo-American "special relationship' would be the principal bulwark of peace.<ref>Jones, Charles "'An Active Danger': Carr at The Times" pp. 68–87 from ''E.H. Carr A Critical Appraisal'' ed. Michael Cox, London: Palgrave, 2000 p. 77</ref> As a result of Carr's leaders, the ''Times'' became popularly known during World War II as the three-pence [[Morning Star (British newspaper)|''Daily Worker'']] (the price of the ''Daily Worker'' being one penny).<ref name="Haslam p. 37"/> Commenting on Carr's pro-Soviet leaders, the British writer [[George Orwell]] wrote in 1942 that "all the appeasers, e.g. Professor E. H. Carr, have switched their allegiance from Hitler to Stalin".<ref name="Collini" />

Reflecting his disgust with Carr's leaders in the ''Times'', the British civil servant [[Alexander Cadogan|Sir Alexander Cadogan]], the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, wrote in his diary: "I hope someone will tie [[Robert Barrington-Ward|Barrington-Ward]] and Ted Carr together and throw them into the Thames."<ref name="Davies pp. 473-511"/>

During a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'', which was published as a book in 1946, Carr argued that "The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable", that [[Marxism]] was the by far the most successful type of [[totalitarianism]] as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the [[Red Army]]'s role in defeating Germany, and that only the "blind and incurable ignored these trends".<ref name="Laqueur, p. 131">Laqueur, p. 131</ref> During the same lectures, Carr called democracy in the Western world a sham, which permitted a capitalist ruling class to exploit the majority, and praised the Soviet Union as offering real democracy.<ref name="Davies pp. 473-511"/> One of Carr's leading associates, the British historian [[R. W. Davies]], was later to write that Carr's view of the Soviet Union as expressed in ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'' was a rather glossy and idealised picture.<ref name="Davies pp. 473-511"/>

== Cold War ==
In 1946, Carr started living with Joyce Marion Stock Forde, who was to remain his common law wife until 1964.<ref name=Cobb180/> In 1947, Carr was forced to resign from his position at Aberystwyth.<ref name=d491>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 491</ref>{{why|date=June 2021}} In the late 1940s, Carr started to become increasingly influenced by [[Marxism]].<ref name="Deutscher pp. 78"/> His name was on [[Orwell's list]], a list of people which [[George Orwell]] prepared in March 1949 for the [[Information Research Department]], a propaganda unit set up at the Foreign Office by the Labour government. Orwell considered these people to have pro-communist leanings and therefore to be inappropriate to write for the IRD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities|title=Blair's babe|author=John Ezard|work=The Guardian}}</ref> In 1948, Carr condemned the British acceptance of an American loan in 1946 as marking the effective end of British independence.<ref name="Haslam, p. 152">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'' p. 152</ref> Carr went on to write that the best course for Britain was to seek neutrality in the Cold War and that "peace at any price must be the foundation of British policy".<ref name="Haslam, p. 153">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'' p. 153</ref> Carr took a great deal of hope from the [[Tito–Stalin Split|Soviet–Yugoslav split]] of 1948.<ref name="Haslam, p. 151">Haslam, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nTxgdXSEAecC&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Vices of Integrity''] p. 151</ref>

In May–June 1951, Carr delivered a series of speeches on British radio entitled ''The New Society'', that advocated a commitment to mass democracy, egalitarian democracy, and "public control and planning" of the economy.<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 490</ref> Carr was a reclusive man whom few knew well, but his circle of close friends included [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[A. J. P. Taylor]], [[Harold Laski]] and [[Karl Mannheim]].<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 474</ref> Carr was especially close to Deutscher.<ref name="Deutscher pp. 78" />{{rp|78–79}} In the early 1950s, when Carr sat on the editorial board of [[Chatham House]], he attempted to block the publication of the manuscript that eventually became ''The Origins of the Communist Autocracy'' by [[Leonard Schapiro]] on the ground that the subject of [[repression in the Soviet Union]] was not a serious topic for a historian.<ref name="Haslam, pp. 158-164">Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'' pp. 158–164</ref> As interest in the subject of Communism grew, Carr largely abandoned [[international relations]] as a field of study.<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'' p. 252</ref> In 1956, Carr did not comment on the Soviet suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]], while at the same time condemning the [[Suez Crisis|Suez War]].<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'' p. 177</ref>

In 1966, Carr left Forde and married the historian [[Betty Behrens]].<ref name=Cobb180/> That same year, Carr wrote in an essay that in India, where "liberalism is professed and to some extent practised, millions of people would die without American charity. In China, where liberalism is rejected, people somehow get fed. Which is the more cruel and oppressive regime?"<ref name="Conquest pp. 32-38">Conquest, Robert "Agit-Prof" pp. 32–38 from ''The New Republic'', Volume 424, Issue # 4, 1 November 1999 p. 36</ref> One of Carr's critics, the British historian [[Robert Conquest]], commented that Carr did not appear to be familiar with recent Chinese history, because, judging from that remark, Carr seemed to be ignorant of the millions of Chinese who had starved to death during the [[Great Leap Forward]].<ref name="Conquest pp. 32-38"/> In 1961, Carr published an anonymous and very favourable review of his friend [[A. J. P. Taylor]]'s contentious book ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]]'', which caused much controversy. In the late 1960s, Carr was one of the few British professors to be supportive of the [[New Left]] student protestors, whom, he hoped, might bring about a socialist revolution in Britain.<ref name=autogenerated4>Haslam, "We Need a Faith", pp. 36–39 from ''[[History Today]]'', Volume 33, August 1983 p. 39</ref>

Carr exercised wide influence in the field of Soviet studies and international relations. The extent of Carr's influence could be seen in the 1974 ''[[festschrift]]'' in his honour, entitled ''Essays in Honour of E.H. Carr'' ed. [[Chimen Abramsky]] and Beryl Williams. The contributors included Sir [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Arthur Lehning]], [[G. A. Cohen]], [[Monica Partridge]], Beryl Williams, [[Eleonore Breuning]], [[D. C. Watt]], [[Mary Holdsworth]], [[Roger Morgan]], [[Alec Nove]], [[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]], [[Michael Kaser]], [[R. W. Davies]], [[Moshe Lewin]], [[Maurice Dobb]], and [[Lionel Kochan]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Ambramsky, C. & Williams, Beryl ''Essays in Honour of E.H. Carr'' pp. v–vi</ref>

In a 1978 interview in ''[[New Left Review]]'', Carr called Western economies "crazy" and doomed in the long run.<ref name="Davies p. 508">Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 508</ref> In a 1980 letter to his friend [[Tamara Deutscher]], Carr wrote that he felt that the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] had forced "the forces of Socialism" in Britain into a "full retreat".<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 289</ref> In the same letter to Deutscher, Carr wrote that "Socialism cannot be obtained through reformism, i.e. through the machinery of [[bourgeois democracy]]".<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 509</ref> Carr went on to decry disunity on the left.<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 509-510</ref> Although Carr regarded the abandonment of [[Maoism]] in China in the late 1970s as a regressive development, he saw opportunities and wrote to his stockbroker in 1978 that "a lot of people, as well as the Japanese, are going to benefit from the opening up of trade with China. Have you any ideas?"<ref>Haslam, ''The Vices of Integrity'', p. 290</ref>

Controversy surrounds the question of whether Carr was an anti-Semite.<ref name="Haslam, pp. 21-35">Haslam, "E.H. Carr's Search for Meaning" pp. 21–35 from ''E.H. Carr A Critical Appraisal'' ed. Michael Cox, Palgrave: London, 2000 p. 27</ref> Carr's critics point to his being champion of two anti-Semitic dictators (Hitler and Stalin) in succession, his opposition to Israel and to most of Carr's opponents, such as Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]], [[Leonard Schapiro]], Sir [[Karl Popper]], [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[Adam Ulam]], [[Leopold Labedz]], Sir [[Isaiah Berlin]], and [[Walter Laqueur]], being Jewish. Carr's defenders, such as Jonathan Haslam, have argued against the charge of anti-Semitism, noting that Carr had many Jewish friends (including such erstwhile intellectual sparring partners as Berlin and Namier), that his last wife Betty Behrens was Jewish and that his support for Nazi Germany in the 1930s and the Soviet Union in the 1940s–1950s was in spite of rather than because of anti-Semitism in those states.<ref name="Haslam, pp. 21-35"/>

== ''History of Soviet Russia'' ==
{{main|A History of Soviet Russia}}
[[File:Carrite-shelf.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Carr's ''History of Soviet Russia'' runs to 14 volumes and has been extended into the 1930s by historian [[R. W. Davies|R.W. Davies]] and others.]]
After the war, Carr was a fellow and tutor in Politics at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] from 1953 to 1955, when he became a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he remained until his death in 1982. During this period he published most of ''[[A History of Soviet Russia]]'' as well as ''[[What Is History?]]''.

Towards the end of 1944, Carr decided to write a complete history of Soviet Russia from 1917 comprising all aspects of [[Social history|social]], [[Political history|political]] and [[economic history]] to explain how the Soviet Union withstood the German invasion.<ref>Hughes-Warrington, pp. 24–25</ref> The resulting work, his 14-volume ''History of Soviet Russia'' (14 vol., 1950–78), took the story up to 1929.<ref name=d493>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 493</ref> Like many others, Carr argued that the emergence of Russia from a backward peasant economy to a leading industrial power was the most important event of the 20th century.<ref name="Hughes-Warrington, Marnie p. 25">Hughes-Warrington, p. 25</ref> The first part of the ''History of Soviet Russia'' comprised three volumes entitled ''The Bolshevik Revolution'', published in 1950, 1952, and 1953, and traced Soviet history from 1917 to 1922.<ref>Laqueur, pp. 116–117</ref> The second part was originally intended to comprise three volumes called ''The Struggle for Power'', covering 1922–28, but Carr instead decided to publish a single volume labelled ''The Interregnum'' that covered the events of 1923–24, and another four volumes entitled ''Socialism in One Country'', which took the story up to 1926.<ref>Laqueur, p. 118</ref> Carr's final volumes in the series were entitled ''The Foundations of the Planned Economy'', and covered the years until 1929. Carr had planned to take the series up to [[Operation Barbarossa]] in 1941 and the Soviet victory of 1945, but died before he could complete the project. Carr's last book, 1982's ''The Twilight of the Comintern'', examined the response of the Comintern to fascism in 1930–1935. Although it was not officially a part of the ''History of Soviet Russia'' series, Carr regarded it as completing it. Another related book that Carr was unable to complete before his death, and was published posthumously in 1984, was ''The Comintern and the Spanish Civil War''.<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 507</ref>

Another book that was not part of the ''History of Soviet Russia'' series, though closely related due to common research in the same archives, was Carr's 1951 ''German-Soviet Relations Between the Two World Wars, 1919–1939''. In it, Carr blamed British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] for the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939.<ref name="Carr, E.H. 1951, p. 136">Carr, ''German-Soviet Relations'', p. 136</ref> In 1955, a major scandal that damaged Carr's reputation as a historian of the Soviet Union occurred when he wrote the introduction to ''Notes for a Journal'', the supposed memoir of the former Soviet Foreign Commissar [[Maxim Litvinov]] that was shortly thereafter exposed as a [[KGB]] forgery.<ref>Davies, "Edward Hallett Carr", p. 504</ref><ref>Andrew, Christopher & Mitrokhin, Vasili ''The Mitrokhin Archive The KGB in Europe and the West'', London: Penguin Books, 1999, 2000 p. 602</ref> 

Carr was well known in the 1950s as an outspoken admirer of the Soviet Union.<ref name="Haslam p. 39"/> His friend and close associate, the British historian R. W. Davies, was to write that Carr belonged to the anti-Cold-War school of history, which regarded the Soviet Union as the major progressive force in the world, and the [[Cold War]] as a case of American aggression against the Soviet Union.<ref name="Davies. R.W pp. 56-70" />{{rp|59}} The volumes of Carr's ''History of Soviet Russia'' were received with mixed reviews. It was "described by supporters as 'Olympian' and 'monumental' and by enemies as a subtle apologia for Stalin".<ref>Cox, Michael "Introduction" pp. 1–20 from ''E.H. Carr A Critical Appraisal'' ed. Michael Cox, London: Palgrave, 2000 p. 3</ref>

== ''What Is History?'' ==
{{main|What Is History?}}
Carr is also famous today for his work of [[historiography]], ''[[What Is History?]]'' (1961), a book based upon his series of [[G. M. Trevelyan]] lectures, delivered at the [[University of Cambridge]] in January-March 1961. In this work, Carr argued that he was presenting a middle-of-the-road position between the [[Empiricism|empirical]] view of history and [[R. G. Collingwood]]'s [[idealism]].<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26">Huges-Warrington, p. 26</ref> Carr rejected as nonsense the empirical view of the historian's work being an accretion of "facts" that he or she has at their disposal.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26"/> Carr divided facts into two categories: "facts of the past", that is historical information that historians deem unimportant, and "historical facts", information that historians have decided is important.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26"/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', pp. 12–13</ref> Carr contended that historians quite arbitrarily determine which of the "facts of the past" to turn into "historical facts", according to their own biases and agendas.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26"/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', pp. 22–25;</ref>

== Contribution to the theory of international relations ==
Carr contributed to the foundation of what is now known as [[Classical realism (international relations)|classical realism]] in [[International relations theory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mearsheimer|first=John J.|date=June 2005|title=E.H.
