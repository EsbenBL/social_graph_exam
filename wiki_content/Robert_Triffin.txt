'''Robert, Baron Triffin''' (5 October 1911 – 23 February 1993) was a [[Belgian American|Belgian-American]] [[economist]] best known for his critique of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of fixed currency [[exchange rate]]s. His critique became known later as [[Triffin's dilemma]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nasar|first1=Sylvia|title=Robert Triffin, 81, an Economist Who Backed Monetary Stability |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/27/nyregion/robert-triffin-81-an-economist-who-backed-monetary-stability.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 April 2016|date=27 February 1993}}</ref>

==Life==
After completing his undergraduate studies at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], Triffin, a Francophone Belgian, went to the US and received his [[PhD]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1938 and taught there from 1939 until 1942. He held positions in the US [[Federal Reserve System]] (1942–1946), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (1946–1948), and the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] (1948–1951), now the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. In 1951, he became a professor of economics at [[Yale University]], where he also served as Master of Berkeley College from 1969 until 1977.

Triffin became a [[US citizen]] in 1942. He reclaimed his [[Belgian citizenship]] in 1977 and returned to reside in [[Europe]]. There, he was a staunch supporter of [[European integration]] and helped to develop the [[European Monetary System]] and supported the concept of a central bank, which developed as the [[European Central Bank]].

==Bretton Woods critique==
In 1959, Triffin testified before the [[United States Congress]] and warned of serious flaws in the Bretton Woods system.<ref>{{cite book |last= Triffin |first=Robert  |chapter=By the Way of Introduction (Statement to the Joint Economic Committee of the 87th Congress (Washington, 28 October 1959)); The International Monetary Position and Policy of the United States |title=Gold and the Dollar Crisis; The Future of Convertibility |publisher=Yale University Press |place=New Haven |pages=3–14 |via= Internet Archive}}</ref> His theory was based on observing the [[dollar glut]], or the accumulation of the [[United States dollar]] outside the US. Under the [[Bretton Woods system]], the US had pledged to convert dollars into [[gold]], but by the early 1960s, the glut had caused more dollars to be available outside the US than gold was in its Treasury.

In the post-war era, the US had to run deficits on the current account of the [[balance of payments]]<ref>Wolf, M. [http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/12/Pages/26122009/12272009_b60d075ae8834ca981282abc0ee85802.aspx "Do we need a reserve currency?"] Accessed 4 January 2010. {{failed verification|date=October 2018}}</ref> to supply the world with dollar reserves that kept [[liquidity]] for their increased wealth.

However, running continuing deficits on the current account of the balance of payments resulted in an ever-increasing stock of overseas held dollars, eroding confidence in the belief that the dollar would remain convertible into gold at the Bretton Woods parity rate of $35 per ounce.

Triffin predicted that the system would not be able to maintain both liquidity and confidence, a theory later to be known as the [[Triffin dilemma]]. His idea was largely ignored until 1971, when his [[hypothesis]] became reality, forcing US President [[Richard Nixon]] to halt convertibility of the United States dollar into [[gold]], an initiative known colloquially as the [[Nixon Shock]], which effectively ended the [[Bretton Woods system#Late Bretton Woods System|Bretton Woods System]].
