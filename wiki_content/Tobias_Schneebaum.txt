'''Tobias Schneebaum''' (March 25, 1922 – September 20, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[anthropologist]], and [[AIDS]] [[activist]]. He is best known for his experiences living and traveling among the [[Harakmbut people|Harakmbut]] people of [[Peru]], and the [[Asmat people]] of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], [[Western New Guinea]], [[Indonesia]], then known as Irian Jaya.

==Early life==
Schneebaum was born into a family of Jewish emigres from Poland in [[New York City]]. Schneebaum's father Jacob (known as Yankle) emigrated to America from Poland just before [[World War I]], in which he served in order to get U.S. citizenship. His mother, Riftcha, emigrated in 1913.

He was born as '''Toivele Schneebaum''' on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]] and grew up in [[Brooklyn]]. A school official later changed this to '''Theodore Schneebaum''', by which he was known by friends and family throughout his childhood. (He later changed his name legally to Tobias.) In 1939 he graduated from the [[Stuyvesant High School]], moving on to the [[City College of New York]], graduating in 1943 after majoring in [[mathematics]] and [[art]]. During [[World War II]] he served as a radar repairman in the [[U.S. Army]].<ref name="The New York Times">{{cite journal|title=Tobias Schneebaum, Chronicler and Dining Partner of Cannibals, Dies|journal=The New York Times|date=2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/obituaries/tobias-schneebaum-chronicler-and-dining-partner-of-cannibals.html|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref><ref name="Schneebaum1989">{{cite book|last=Schneebaum|first=Tobias|authorlink=Tobias Schneebaum|title=Where the Spirits Dwell: An Odyssey in the New Guinea Jungle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmXhOwEn9RIC&pg=PA20|year=1989|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0-8021-3166-9|pages=20–}}</ref>

==Travels==

After hitch-hiking from [[New York City|New York]] to Peru, he lived with the Harakmbut people for seven months, and said he had joined the tribe in [[cannibalism]] on one occasion.<ref name="villagevoice">{{citation |title=The Boys on the Side |first=David |last=Winner |date=2005-11-28 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0548,winner,70427,20.html |periodical=[[The Village Voice]] |accessdate=2007-09-01}}.</ref><ref name="1stdibs">{{cite web|title=Abstract Ink and Watercolor Drawing by Tobias Schneebaum|url=https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/wall-decorations/drawings/abstract-ink-watercolor-drawing-tobias-schneebaum/id-f_7006023/|website=[[1stdibs]]|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>
