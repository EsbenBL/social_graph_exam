==Biography==
Zhang Weiying graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1982, and a master's degree in 1984, from [[Northwest University (China)]]. He received his M. Phil. in economics in 1992 and D. Phil. in economics from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. His D. Phil. supervisors were [[James Mirrlees]] (1996 [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]]) and Donald Hay. Between 1984 and 1990, he was a research fellow of the Economic System Reform Institute of China under the State Commission of Restructuring Economic System. During this period, he was heavily involved in economic reform policy-making in China. He was the first Chinese economist who proposed the "dual-track [[price system]] reform" (in 1984). He was also known for his contributions to [[macro-control]] policy debating, ownership reform debating, and entrepreneurship studies. After he graduated from Oxford, he co-founded [[China Center for Economic Research]] (CCER), [[Peking University]] in 1994, and worked with the Center first as an [[Professor|associate professor]] and then as a professor until August 1997. He then moved to Peking University's Guanghua School of Management in September 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emc.pku.edu.cn/en/faculty_detail.asp?tid%3D15 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707030730/http://emc.pku.edu.cn/en/faculty_detail.asp?tid=15 |archive-date=July 7, 2011 }}</ref> He was removed as Dean from the Guanghua School of Management in 2010; the removal was attributed to his radical views, which distracted him from the responsibilities of being a dean, according to one teacher at the school.<ref>''Economic Observer'', "Zhang Weiyang Removed as Dean of Guanghua School of Management", http://www.eeo.com.cn/ens/homepage/briefs/2010/12/14/188926.shtml (December 14, 2010)</ref>
