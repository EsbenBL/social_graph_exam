The '''Political Studies Association''' ('''PSA''') is a [[learned society]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which exists to develop and promote the study of [[politics]]. It is the leading association in its field in the United Kingdom, with an international membership including academics in political science and current affairs, theorists and practitioners, policy makers, researchers and students in higher education.

The PSA was founded in 1950, following the establishment of the [[International Political Science Association]] in 1949, and was initially supported by a grant from [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/publications/brochure/PSA_Brochure.pdf |title=Political Studies UK: Studying, Teaching and Researching Politics in the United Kingdom |publisher=Political Studies Association |date=2004 |accessdate=2008-04-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925034755/http://www.psa.ac.uk/publications/brochure/PSA_Brochure.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2006 }}</ref>

The PSA has a network of over fifty "Specialist Groups" that provide a research focus for members and receive support from the PSA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa-communities/specialist-groups |title=Political Studies Association: Specialist Groups|publisher=Political Studies Association |date=2007 |accessdate=2016-10-24 }}</ref>

== Publications ==
The PSA publishes four [[academic journals|journals]]: 
* ''[[British Journal of Politics and International Relations]]''
* ''[[Political Studies (journal)|Political Studies]]'': publishes research in all areas of politics and international relations. The journal's approach is not dominated by a particular methodological or theoretical framework. Indeed, the editors have expressed their  wish to encourage a pluralism and debate between approaches.<ref>http://www.politicalstudies.org/ Political Studies (journal)</ref>
* ''[[Political Studies Review]]'': provides not only reviews of new books and literature on political science and international relations but also provides a forum for wide-ranging debates and reviews.<ref>http://www.politicalstudiesreview.org/ Political Studies Review</ref>
* ''[[Politics (academic journal)|Politics]]''.

== Awards ==
