===Risk aversion===
After getting his PhD from [[M.I.T.]] in 1967, Stiglitz co-authored one of his first papers with [[Michael Rothschild]] for the Journal of Economic Theory in 1970.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Stiglitz and Rothschild built upon works by economists such as [[Robert Solow]] on the concept of [[Risk aversion (psychology)|risk aversion]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Stiglitz and Rothschild showed three plausible definitions of a variable X being 'more variable' than a variable Y were all equivalent - Y being equal to X plus noise, every risk averse agent preferring Y to X, and Y having more weight in its tails, and that none of these were always consistent with X having a higher statistical variance than Y - a commonly used definition at the time. In a second paper, they analyzed the theoretical consequences of risk aversion in various circumstances, such as an individual's savings decisions and a firm's production decisions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Henry George theorem===
Stiglitz made early contributions to a theory of public finance stating that an optimal supply of local [[public goods]] can be funded entirely through [[value capture|capture]] of the [[land (economics)|land]] [[economic rent|rents]] generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the '[[Henry George theorem]]' in reference to the radical [[classical economist]] [[Henry George]] who famously advocated for [[land value tax]]. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by at least as much as its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a [[Georgism|single tax on rents]] is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.<ref>Richard J. Arnott & Joseph E. Stiglitz, 1979. "Aggregate Land Rents, Expenditure on Public Goods, and Optimal City Size," The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Oxford University Press, vol. 93(4), pages 471–500.</ref><ref>Stiglitz, J.E. (1977) The theory of local public goods. In: Feldstein, M.S. and R.P. Inman (eds.) The Economics of Public Services. MacMillan, London, pp. 274–333.</ref>

===Information asymmetry===
Stiglitz's most famous research was on [[Screening (economics)|screening]], a technique used by one economic agent to extract otherwise private information from another.  It was for this contribution to the theory of [[information asymmetry]] that he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics<ref name=NOBEL1 /> in 2001 "for laying the foundations for [[information asymmetry|the theory of markets with asymmetric information]]" with [[George A. Akerlof]] and [[A. Michael Spence]].

Much of Stiglitz's work on [[information economics]] demonstrates situations in which incomplete information prevents markets from achieving social efficiency. His paper with [[Andrew Weiss (economist)|Andrew Weiss]] showed that if banks use interest rates to infer information about borrowers' types (adverse selection effect) or to encourage their actions following borrowing (incentive effect), then credit will be rationed below the optimal level, even in a competitive market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stiglitz|first1=Joseph|last2=Weiss|first2=Andrew|date=February 1987|title=Macro-Economic Equilibrium and Credit Rationing|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w2164|doi-access=free}}</ref> Stiglitz and [[Michael Rothschild|Rothschild]]  showed that in an insurance market, firms have an incentive to undermine a 'pooling equilibrium', where all agents are offered the same full-insurance policy, by offering cheaper partial insurance that would only be attractive to the low-risk types, meaning that a competitive market can only achieve partial coverage of agents.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Rothschild|first1=Michael|title=Equilibrium in Competitive Insurance Markets: An Essay on the Economics of Imperfect Information|date=1976|work=Foundations of Insurance Economics|pages=355–375|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048157891|last2=Stiglitz|first2=Joseph|doi=10.1007/978-94-015-7957-5_18}}</ref> Stiglitz and [[Sanford J.

=== Monopolistic competition ===
Stiglitz, together with [[Avinash Dixit]], created a tractable model of [[Dixit–Stiglitz model|monopolistic competition]] that was an alternative to traditional perfect-competition models of general equilibrium. They showed that in the presence of increasing returns to scale, the entry of firms is socially too small.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Dixit|first1=Avinash K.|chapter=Monopolistic competition and optimum product diversity (May 1974)|pages=70–88|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511492273|last2=Stiglitz|first2=Joseph E.|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511492273.004|title=The Monopolistic Competition Revolution in Retrospect|year=2001}}</ref> The model was extended to show that when consumers have a preference for diversity, entry can be socially too large. The modelling approach was also influential in the fields of trade theory, and industrial organisation, and was used by [[Paul Krugman]] in his analysis of non comparative advantage trading patterns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.sciences-po.fr/sites/default/files/file/krugman-79.pdf|title=Increasing returns, monopolistic competition and global trade|last=Krugman|first=Paul}}</ref>

===Shapiro–Stiglitz efficiency wage model===
{{Main|Shapiro–Stiglitz theory}}
{{See also|Efficiency wages}}
[[File:Efficiency wage Shapiro Stiglitz.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|In the [[Shapiro–Stiglitz model]] of efficiency wages, workers are paid at a level that dissuades shirking. This prevents wages from dropping to market clearing levels. Full employment cannot be achieved because workers would shirk if they were not threatened with the possibility of unemployment. Because of this, the curve for the no-shirking condition (labeled NSC) goes to infinity at full employment.]]

Stiglitz also did research on [[efficiency wages]], and helped create what became known as the "Shapiro–Stiglitz model" to explain why there is unemployment even in equilibrium, why wages are not bid down sufficiently by job seekers (in the absence of minimum wages) so that everyone who wants a job finds one, and to question whether the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical paradigm]] could explain [[involuntary unemployment]].<ref name = SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL/>  An answer to these puzzles was proposed by [[Carl Shapiro|Shapiro]] and Stiglitz in 1984: "Unemployment is driven by the information structure of employment".<ref name=SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL>{{cite journal | last1 = Stiglitz | first1 = Joseph E. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = Carl | title = Equilibrium unemployment as a worker discipline device | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 433–44 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] via [[JSTOR]] | date = June 1984 | jstor = 1804018 }}</ref> Two basic observations undergird their analysis:

# Unlike other forms of capital, humans can choose their level of effort.

# Wages do not fall enough during recessions to prevent unemployment from rising. If the demand for labour falls, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, the probability of 'shirking' (workers not exerting effort) has risen. If employment levels are to be maintained, through a sufficient lowering of wages, workers will be less productive than before through the shirking effect. As a consequence, in the model, wages do not fall enough to maintain employment levels at the previous state, because firms want to avoid excessive shirking by their workers. So, unemployment must rise during recessions, because wages are kept 'too high'.
# Possible corollary: Wage sluggishness. Moving from one private cost of hiring (w∗) to another private cost of hiring (w∗∗) will require each firm to repeatedly re-optimize wages in response to shifting unemployment rate. Firms cannot cut wages until unemployment rises sufficiently (a coordination problem).

The outcome is never Pareto efficient.

# Each firm employs too few workers because it faces private cost of hiring rather than the social cost{{snd}} which is equal to and in all cases.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}}  This means that firms do not "internalize" the "external" cost of unemployment{{snd}} they do not factor how large-scale unemployment harms society when assessing their own costs.  This leads to a negative externality as marginal social cost exceeds the firm's marginal cost (MSC = Firm's Private Marginal Cost + Marginal External Cost of increased social unemployment){{Clarify|date=January 2010}}
# There are also positive externalities: each firm increases the asset value of unemployment for all other firms when they hire during recessions.  By creating hypercompetitive labor markets, all firms (the winners when laborers compete) experience an increase in value.  However, this effect of increased valuation is very unapparent, because the first problem (the negative externality of sub-optimal hiring) clearly dominates since the 'natural rate of unemployment' is always too high.

==Government==
===Clinton administration===
Stiglitz joined the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] in 1993,<ref>{{cite web | title = Brief Biography of Joseph E. Stiglitz | url = http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/bio.cfm | website = columbia.edu | publisher = [[Columbia University]] | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110829164327/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/bio.cfm | archive-date = 2011-08-29 }}</ref> serving first as a member during 1993–1995, and was then appointed Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] on June 28, 1995, in which capacity he also served as a member of the cabinet. He became deeply involved in environmental issues, which included serving on the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and helping draft a new law for toxic wastes (which was never passed).

Stiglitz's most important contribution in this period was helping define a new economic philosophy, a "third way", which postulated the important, but limited, role of government, that unfettered markets often did not work well, but that government was not always able to correct the limitations of markets. The academic research that he had been conducting over the preceding 25 years provided the intellectual foundations for this "third way".

When President [[Bill Clinton]] was re-elected, he asked Stiglitz to continue to serve as Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] for another term. But he had already been approached by the [[World Bank]] to be its senior vice president for development policy and its chief economist, and he assumed that position after his CEA successor was confirmed on February 13, 1997.

As the World Bank began its ten-year review of the transition of the former [[Communist|Communist countries]] to the [[market economy]] it unveiled failures of the countries that had followed the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy policies]]{{snd}} both in terms of the declines in GDP and increases in poverty{{snd}} that were even worse than the worst that most of its critics had envisioned at the onset of the transition. Clear links existed between the dismal performances and the policies that the IMF had advocated, such as the voucher privatization schemes and excessive monetary stringency.  Meanwhile, the success of a few countries that had followed quite different strategies suggested that there were alternatives that could have been followed. The [[US Treasury]] had put enormous pressure on the [[World Bank]] to silence his criticisms of the policies which they and the IMF had pursued.<ref name=SHOIWDOWN>{{Cite journal | last = Wade | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Wade (development scholar) | title = Showdown at the World Bank | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 7 | pages = 124–37 | publisher = New Left Review | date = January–February 2001 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/7/robert-wade-showdown-at-the-world-bank }}</ref><ref name=DANGEROUS>{{cite web | last = Hage | first = Dave |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/101100-101.htm |title=Joseph Stiglitz: A Dangerous Man, A World Bank Insider Who Defected | work = [[Star Tribune]] |publisher=Commondreams.org | location = Minneapolis |date=October 11, 2000 |access-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814032443/http://www.commondreams.org/views/101100-101.htm |archive-date=August 14, 2013 }}</ref>

Stiglitz always had a poor relationship with Treasury Secretary [[Lawrence Summers]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Hirsh | first = Michael | title = Why Washington ignores an economic prophet | url = http://europe.newsweek.com/why-washington-ignores-economic-prophet-81985?rm=eu | work = [[Newsweek]] |publisher=Newsweek LLC |date = 18 July 2009 }}</ref> In 2000, Summers successfully petitioned for Stiglitz's removal, supposedly in exchange for World Bank President [[James Wolfensohn]]'s re-appointment{{snd}} an exchange that Wolfensohn denies took place.

Stiglitz resigned from the World Bank in January 2000, a month before his term expired.<ref name=DANGEROUS /> The [[World Bank|Bank's president]], James Wolfensohn, announced Stiglitz's resignation in November 1999 and also announced that Stiglitz would stay on as Special Advisor to the President, and would chair the search committee for a successor.

{{quote|Joseph E.

In this role, he continued criticism of the IMF, and, by implication, the US Treasury Department. In April 2000, in an article for ''[[The New Republic]]'', he wrote:

{{quote|They'll say the IMF is arrogant. They'll say the IMF doesn't really listen to the developing countries it is supposed to help. They'll say the IMF is secretive and insulated from democratic accountability. They'll say the IMF's economic 'remedies' often make things worse{{snd}} turning slowdowns into recessions and recessions into depressions. And they'll have a point. I was chief economist at the World Bank from 1996 until last November, during the gravest global economic crisis in a half-century. I saw how the IMF, in tandem with the U.S. Treasury Department, responded. And I was appalled.}}

The article was published a week before the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF and provoked a strong response. It proved too strong for Summers and, yet more lethally, Stiglitz's protector-of-sorts at the World Bank, Wolfensohn. Wolfensohn had privately empathised with Stiglitz's views, but this time was worried for his second term, which Summers had threatened to veto.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the IMF, called a special staff meeting and informed at that gathering that Wolfensohn had agreed to fire Stiglitz.  Meanwhile, the Bank's External Affairs department told the press that Stiglitz had not been fired, his post had merely been abolished.<ref name=WADE>{{cite book | last = Wade | first = Robert | title = US hegemony and the World Bank: Stiglitz's firing and Kanbur's resignation | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529110008/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/evans/evans_pdf/Wade.pdf | archive-date = 29 May 2008 | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/evans/evans_pdf/Wade.pdf | publisher = [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] }}</ref>

In a September 19, 2008 radio interview, with [[Aimee Allison]] and Philip Maldari on [[Pacifica Foundation|Pacifica Radio]]'s [[KPFA]] 94.1&nbsp;FM in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], US, Stiglitz implied that President Clinton and his economic advisors would not have backed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) had they been aware of stealth provisions, inserted by lobbyists, that they overlooked.

===Initiative for Policy Dialogue===
{{Main|Initiative for Policy Dialogue}}
In July 2000, Stiglitz founded the [[Initiative for Policy Dialogue]] (IPD), with support of the Ford, Rockefeller, McArthur, and Mott Foundations and the Canadian and Swedish governments, to enhance democratic processes for decision-making in developing countries and to ensure that a broader range of alternatives are on the table and more stakeholders are at the table.

===Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress===
At the beginning of 2008, Stiglitz chaired the [[Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress]], also known as the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, initiated by President Sarkozy of France. The Commission held its first plenary meeting on April 22–23, 2008, in Paris. Its final report was made public on September 14, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stiglitz documentation | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150720212135/http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm | archive-date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm | publisher = Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress | date = September 14, 2009 }}</ref>

In 2009, Stiglitz chaired the [[Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System]] which was convened by the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] "to review the workings of the [[global financial system]], including major bodies such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and to suggest steps to be taken by Member States to secure a more [[sustainability|sustainable]] and [[global justice|just global economic order]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/president/63/commission/background.shtml|title=Terms of Reference Commission of Experts of the President of the United Nations General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System|access-date=May 27, 2009}}</ref> Its final report was released on September 21, 2009.<ref>[https://www.un.org/ga/president/63/commission/financial_commission.shtml The Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System], UN General Assembly</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=NGLS |url=http://www.un-ngls.org/spip.php?page=cfr |title=Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System, official site |publisher=Un-ngls.org |access-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref>

===Greek debt crisis===
In 2010, Professor Stiglitz acted as an advisor to the Greek government during the [[Greek debt crisis]]. He appeared on Bloomberg TV for an interview on the risks of Greece defaulting, in which he stated that he was very confident that Greece would not default. He went on to say that Greece was under "speculative attack" and though it had "short-term liquidity problems ... and would benefit from Solidarity Bonds", the country was "on track to meet its obligations".<ref>{{Cite news|date=2010-06-01|title=Euro Likely to Survive Debt Crisis, Stiglitz Says|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-06-01/euro-likely-to-survive-continent-s-debt-crisis-nobel-winner-stiglitz-says|access-date=2021-02-17}}</ref>

The next day, during a BBC interview, Stiglitz stated that "there's no problem of Greece or Spain meeting their interest payments". He argued nonetheless, that it would be desirable and needed for all of Europe to make a clear statement of belief in social solidarity and that they "stand behind Greece". Confronted with the statement: "Greece's difficulty is that the magnitude of debt is far greater than the capacity of the economy to service", Stiglitz replied, "That's rather absurd".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 2012, Stiglitz described the European austerity plans as a "suicide-pact".<ref name=Moore1>{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|title=Stiglitz says European austerity plans are a 'suicide pact'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9019819/Stiglitz-says-European-austerity-plans-are-a-suicide-pact.html|access-date=April 26, 2012|newspaper=Telegraph|date=Jan 17, 2012|location=London}}</ref>

===Scotland===
Since March 2012, Stiglitz has been a member of the [[Scottish Government]]'s Fiscal Commission Working Group, which oversees the work to establish a fiscal and macro economic framework for an [[Scottish independence|independent Scotland]] on behalf of the Scottish [[Council of Economic Advisers (Scotland)|Council of Economic Advisers]].

Together with Professors [[Andrew Hughes Hallett]], Sir [[James Mirrlees]] and [[Frances Ruane]], Stiglitz will "advise on the establishment of a credible Fiscal Commission which entrenches financial responsibility and ensures market confidence".<ref>{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Fiscal Commission Working Group | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/3011/20130201194612/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/03/fiscal-commission25032012 | archive-date = 1 February 2013 | url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/03/fiscal-commission25032012 | publisher = The Scottish Government | date = 25 March 2012 }}</ref>

In July 2015, Stiglitz endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[2015 Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign|campaign]] in the [[2015 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|Labour Party leadership election]].

Svensson, Chairman of the Prize Committee|date=December 8, 2001|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref> Stiglitz said:<ref>Stiglitz, ''Aula Magna''</ref>

{{quote|I hope to show that [[Information economics|Information Economics]] represents a fundamental change in the prevailing paradigm within economics. Problems of information are central to understanding not only market economics but also political economy, and in the last section of this lecture, I explore some of the implications of information imperfections for political processes.}}

===Support for anti-austerity movement in Spain===
On July 25, 2011, Stiglitz participated in the "I Foro Social del 15M" organized in [[Madrid]] (Spain) expressing his support for the [[anti-austerity movement in Spain]].<ref name="15M SPEECH">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2iKj-1v2Cc| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123222535/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2iKj-1v2Cc| archive-date=2011-11-23 | url-status=dead|title=Joseph Stiglitz apoya el movimiento 15-M|access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> During an informal speech, he made a brief review of some of the problems in Europe and in the United States, the serious unemployment rate and the situation in Greece. "This is an opportunity for economic contribution social measures", argued Stiglitz, who made a critical speech about the way authorities are handling the political exit to the crisis. He encouraged those present to respond to the bad ideas, not with indifference, but with good ideas. "This does not work, you have to change it", he said.

===Criticism of rating agencies===
Stiglitz has been critical of [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|rating agencies]], describing them as the "key culprit" in the financial crisis, noting "they were the party that performed the alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the rating agencies."<ref name=Neate1>{{cite news|last=Neate|first=Rupert|title=Ratings agencies suffer 'conflict of interest', says former Moody's boss|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/22/ratings-agencies-conflict-of-interest|access-date=April 21, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 22, 2011|location=London}}</ref>

Stiglitz co-authored a paper with [[Peter Orszag]] in 2002 titled "Implications of the New Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Risk-Based Capital Standard" where they stated "on the basis of historical experience, the risk to the government from a potential default on GSE debt is effectively zero." However, "the risk-based capital standard ... may fail to reflect the probability of another Great Depression-like scenario."<ref name=fanniemae>{{cite web|url=http://www.pierrelemieux.org/stiglitzrisk.pdf|title=Implications of the New Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Risk-Based Capital Standard|publisher=[[Fannie Mae]]|access-date=February 10, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122094851/http://www.pierrelemieux.org/stiglitzrisk.pdf|archive-date=November 22, 2009}}</ref>

===Criticism of Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership===
{{See also|Trans-Pacific Partnership#Response|Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership#activism against TTIP}}
Stiglitz warned that the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) presented "grave risks" and it "serves the interests of the wealthiest."<ref>{{cite news|title=Secrecy surrounds Trans-Pacific Partnership talks|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/secrecy-surrounds-transpacific-partnership-talks-20131208-2yzea.html|access-date=December 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=December 9, 2013}}</ref><ref name="NYT-20140315">{{cite news |last=Stiglitz |first=Joseph E. |title=On the Wrong Side of Globalization |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/on-the-wrong-side-of-globalization |date=March 15, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=March 17, 2014 }}</ref>

Stiglitz also opposed the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP) trade deal between the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[United States]], and has argued that the [[United Kingdom]] should consider [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|its withdrawal from the EU]] in [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|the 2016 referendum on the matter]] if TTIP passes, saying that "the [[wikt:stricture|strictures]] imposed by TTIP would be sufficiently averse to the functioning of government that it would make me think over again about whether membership of the EU was a good idea".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simons|first1=Ned|title=UK Should Consider Brexit If EU Signs TTIP, Suggests Labour Economics Adviser Joseph Stiglitz|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/03/02/uk-should-consider-brexit-if-eu-signs-ttip-suggests-labour-economics-adviser_n_9368110.html|access-date=14 March 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=2 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sheffield|first1=Hazel|title=EU referendum: UK could be better off leaving if TTIP passes, Joseph Stiglitz says|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eu-referendum-joseph-stiglitz-ttip-labour-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-a6907806.html|access-date=14 March 2016|work=The Independent|date=2 March 2016}}</ref>

===Regulation===
Stiglitz argues that relying solely on business self-interest as the means of achieving the well-being of society and [[economic efficiency]] is misleading, and that instead "What is needed is stronger norms, clearer understandings of what is acceptable{{snd}} and what is not{{snd}} and stronger laws and regulations to ensure that those that do not behave in ways that are consistent with these norms are held accountable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201312240257.html?page=3|title=Ethiopia: Do Human Rights Make Economic Sense?|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=24 December 2013|via=AllAfrica}}</ref>

===Land value tax (Georgism)===
Stiglitz argues that [[land value tax]] would improve the efficiency and equity of agricultural economies. Stiglitz believes that societies should rely on a generalized [[Georgism|Henry George principle]] to finance public goods, protect natural resources, improve land use, and reduce the burden of rents and taxes on the poor while increasing productive capital formation. Stiglitz advocates taxing "natural resource rents at as close to 100 percent as possible" and that a corollary of this principle is that polluters should be taxed for "activities that generate negative externalities."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cleveland | first1 = M.

===Views on the eurozone===
In a September 2016 interview Stiglitz stated that "the cost of keeping the Eurozone together probably exceeds the cost of breaking it up."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Photiadou|first1=Artemis|last2=Brown|first2=Stuart|title=Interview with Joseph Stiglitz: "The cost of keeping the Eurozone together probably exceeds the cost of breaking it up"|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/09/05/interview-joseph-stiglitz-brexit-euro-mistake/|website=blogs.lse.ac.uk|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|date=5 September 2016}}</ref>

====Advice for the eurozone countries====
In the 1990s, he wrote that ''"countries in North America and Europe should eliminate all tariffs and quotas'' (protectionist measures)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/101100-101.htm|title=Joseph Stiglitz -- A Dangerous Man, A World Bank Insider Who Defected|date=14 August 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814032443/http://www.commondreams.org/views/101100-101.htm|archive-date=14 August 2013}}</ref> He now advises the eurozone countries to control their trade balance with Germany by means of export/[[import certificates]] or "trade chits" (a protectionist measure).<ref>{{cite web|last=Collier|first=Paul|date=September 30, 2016|title=Euro septic: Paul Collier on the problems with the European single currency and the unlikelihood of a solution|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/euro-septic/|access-date=2021-05-05|website=The TLS}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBycCgAAQBAJ&q=trade+chits&pg=PT205|title=The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|date=16 August 2016|publisher=W.

Citing Keynesian theory, he explains that trade surpluses are harmful: ''"[[John Maynard Keynes]] pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a "negative externality" on trading partners. Indeed, Keynes believed it was surplus countries, far more than those in deficit, that posed a threat to global prosperity; he went so far as to advocate a tax on surplus countries"''.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/reform-euro-or-bin-it-greece-germany|title=Reform the euro or bin it - Joseph Stiglitz|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=5 May 2010|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

Stiglitz writes: ''"Germany's surplus means that the rest of Europe is in deficit. And the fact that these countries import more than they export contributes to the weakness of their economies"''. He thinks that surplus countries are getting richer at the expense of deficit countries. He notes that the euro is the cause of this deficit and that as the trade deficit declines GDP would rise and unemployment would fall: ''"The euro system means that Germany's exchange rate cannot increase compared to other euro area members. If the exchange rate were to rise, Germany would have more difficulty exporting and its economic model, based on strong exports, would cease. At the same time, the rest of Europe would export more, GDP would rise and unemployment would fall"''.<ref name=":0" />

He also thinks that the rest of the world should impose a carbon-adjustment tax (a protectionist measure) on American exports that do not comply with global standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/02/paris-climate-deal-to-trumps-rogue-america|title=How to respond to Trump's America - Joseph Stiglitz|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=2 June 2017|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

====Advice for United States====
Contrary to Keynesian theory and these analyses on the Eurozone, he argues that the United States should not rebalance the trade account and can no longer apply protectionist measures to protect or recreate the well-paying manufacturing jobs, saying: "The very Americans who have been among the losers of globalization stand to be among the losers of a reversal of globalization. History cannot be put into reverse".<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/donald-trump-china-economics-trade|title=Trump's Most Chilling Economic Lie|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|date=17 February 2017}}</ref>
 
On the other hand, he admits that as trade deficit declines "GDP would rise and unemployment would fall", further stating: "...the fact that these countries are importing more than they are exporting contributes to their weak economies."<ref name=":0" /> He also notes that trade deficit is correlated with loss of manufacturing jobs: the increase in the "value of the dollar will lead to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs".<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/globalization-of-discontent-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2017-12|title=The Globalization of Our Discontent by Joseph E.

He denounces the "trickle-down" policies of liberalism and [[neoliberalism]] (''[[laissez-faire]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/30/neoliberalism-must-be-pronouced-dead-and-buried-where-next

According to him, it is not China (which has a large trade surplus) that makes "trade war", but the United States (which has a large trade deficit).<ref name=":1" /> He advises China to take sanctions against the United States.<ref name=":1" /> He warns that China could hit back at the U.S. "where hurts economically and politically" if the United States tries to raise tariffs, saying: "For example, cutbacks in purchases by China will lead to more unemployment in congressional districts that are vulnerable, influential, or both.<ref name=":1" /> ... China can retaliate anywhere it chooses, such as by using trade restrictions to target jobs in the congressional districts of those who support US tariffs.<ref name=":2"/> ... China may be more effective in targeting its retaliation to cause acute political pain. ... It's anybody's guess who can stand the pain better. Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/09/my-new-year-forecast-trumpian-uncertainty-and-lots-of-it|title=My new year forecast: Trumpian uncertainty, and lots of it|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=9 January 2017|website=The Guardian}}</ref>"

Between China and the United States, they advise opposite policies. We can see that he does not want the United States to stop free trade. According to him, if China limits globalization, it will not hurt them, but if the United States stops with the process of free trade, it will be harmful. About China, according to him, if China depends less on [[economic globalization]], it will not be negative for the country.<ref name=":1" /> He writes that the decline in exports from China to the U.S. may not "hurt them more than it hurt us" because "China’s government has far more control over the country’s economy than our government has over ours; and it is moving from export dependence to a model of growth driven by domestic demand." Regarding the United States, he writes the opposite and advice to apply the opposite of the Keynesian theory of trade deficits seen earlier:<ref name=":0" /> "Walking away from globalization may reduce our imports, but it will also reduce exports in tandem. And, almost surely, jobs will be destroyed faster than they will be created: there may even be fewer net manufacturing jobs". "[The] erection of barriers to trade and the movement of people and ideas more likely than not will be one in which the U.S. almost surely will lose."<ref name=":1" />

In early 2017, he wrote that "the American middle class is indeed the loser of [[globalization]]" (the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes) and "China, with its large emerging middle class, is among the big beneficiaries of globalization". "Thanks to globalisation, in terms of purchasing-power parity, China actually has already become the largest economy in the world in September 2015".<ref name=":1" /> However,contrary to what he wrote earlier, he later argued in février 2017 that the fall in wages and the disappearance of well-paid jobs in the United States, are not due to free trade or globalisation but rather are inevitable collateral damage to the march of economic progress and technological innovation: "The United States can only push for advanced manufacturing, which requires higher skill sets and employs fewer people. Rising inequality, meanwhile, will continue ...".<ref name=":2"/> In addition, in December 5 2017,contrary to what he wrote earlier, he wrote that the drop in wages in the United States is due to the actions of multinational companies rather than the globalisation and the trade account imbalances between countries caused by free trade: "It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers".<ref name=":4" />

In 2016, he said he believes that the economic situation of the United States is critical: "As the economists Anne Case and [[Angus Deaton]] showed in their study published in December 2015, life expectancy among middle-age white Americans is declining, as rates of suicides, drug use, and alcoholism increase. A year later, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that life expectancy for the country as a whole has declined for the first time in more than 20 years."<ref name=":2"/> ... With the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for swaths of the country".<ref name=":3" /> ?".

=== Green New Deal ===
Stiglitz supports the [[Green New Deal]]. In 2019, he wrote that "The Green New Deal would stimulate demand, ensuring that all available resources were used; and the transition to the green economy would likely usher in a new boom. Trump’s focus on the industries of the past, like coal, is strangling the much more sensible move to wind and solar power. More jobs by far will be created in [[renewable energy]] than will be lost in coal."<ref>{{cite news |title=The climate crisis is our third world war. It needs a bold response |author=Joseph Stiglitz |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/climate-change-world-war-iii-green-new-deal |newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 5, 2019}}</ref>

==Books==
Along with his technical economic publications (over 300 technical articles), Stiglitz is the author of books on issues from patent law to abuses in international trade.

=== ''Whither Socialism?'' (1994) ===
''[[Whither Socialism?]]'' is based on Stiglitz's Wicksell Lectures, presented at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] in 1990 and presents a summary of [[information economics]] and the theory of markets with imperfect information and imperfect competition, as well as being a critique of both free market and market socialist approaches (see Roemer critique, op. cit.).  Stiglitz explains how the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]], or [[Walrasian model]] ("Walrasian economics" refers to the result of the process which has given birth to a formal representation of [[Adam Smith]]'s notion of the "invisible hand", along the lines put forward by [[Léon Walras]] and encapsulated in the general equilibrium model of [[Arrow–Debreu model|Arrow–Debreu]]), may have wrongly encouraged the belief that [[market socialism]] could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the [[information economics]] established by the Greenwald–Stiglitz theorems.

One of the reasons Stiglitz sees for the critical failing in the standard [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical model]], on which [[market socialism]] was built, is its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs of acquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerning completeness.<ref name=ZAPIA>{{cite web|url=http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf |author=Zapia, Carlo |title=The economics of information, market socialism and Hayek's legacy |publisher=Dipartimento di Economia Politica, Università di Siena |access-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614110711/http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf |archive-date=June 14, 2007 }}</ref>

===''Globalization and Its Discontents'' (2002)===
In ''[[Globalization and Its Discontents]]'', Stiglitz argues that what are often called "developing economies" are, in fact, not developing at all, and puts much of the blame on the IMF.

Stiglitz bases his argument on the themes that his decades of theoretical work have emphasized: namely, what happens when people lack the key information that bears on the decisions they have to make, or when markets for important kinds of transactions are inadequate or don't exist, or when other institutions that standard economic thinking takes for granted are absent or flawed. Stiglitz stresses the point: "Recent advances in economic theory" (in part referring to his own work) "have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly." As a result, Stiglitz continues, governments can improve the outcome by well-chosen interventions. Stiglitz argues that when families and firms seek to buy too little compared to what the economy can produce, governments can fight recessions and depressions by using expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to spur the demand for goods and services. At the microeconomic level, governments can regulate banks and other financial institutions to keep them sound. They can also use tax policy to steer investment into more productive industries and trade policies to allow new industries to mature to the point at which they can survive foreign competition. And governments can use a variety of devices, ranging from job creation to manpower training to welfare assistance, to put unemployed labor back to work and cushion human hardship.

Stiglitz argues that the IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow in order to qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions{{snd}} all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.

===''The Roaring Nineties'' (2003)===
''The Roaring Nineties'' is Stiglitz's analysis of the boom and bust of the 1990s. Presented from an insider's point of view, firstly as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and later as chief economist of the World Bank, it continues his argument on how misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to the global economic issues of today, with a perceptive focus on US policies.

===''New Paradigm for Monetary Economics'' (2003)===
{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}

===''Fair Trade for All'' (2005)===
In ''Fair Trade for All'', authors Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton argue that it is important to make the trading world more development friendly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blandford | first1 = David | title = review of ''Fair Trade for All'', by J.E. Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton | journal = American Journal of Agricultural Economics | volume = 90 | issue = 2| page = 2008 }}</ref> The idea is put forth that the present regime of tariffs and agricultural subsidies is dominated by the interests of former colonial powers and needs to change.  The removal of the bias toward the developed world will be beneficial to both developing and developed nations.  The developing world is in need of assistance, and this can only be achieved when developed nations abandon mercantilist based priorities and work towards a more liberal world trade regime.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Northcott | first1 = Michael S. | title = review of ''Fair Trade For All'' by J.E.

===''Making Globalization Work'' (2006)===
''[[Making Globalization Work]]'' surveys the inequities of the global economy, and the mechanisms by which developed countries exert an excessive influence over developing nations. Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.

Stiglitz is an exception to the general pro-globalisation view of professional economists, according to economist [[Martin Wolf]].<ref name=preface>"Why Globalization Works" (Yale University Press 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-300-10252-9}}, p. 8. Also Wolf criticizes World Bank heavily (pp. xiii–xv).</ref> Stiglitz argues that economic opportunities are not widely enough available, that financial crises are too costly and too frequent, and that the rich countries have done too little to address these problems. ''Making Globalization Work''<ref>see {{YouTube|UzhD7KVs-R4|Stiglitz discuss his book}}</ref> has sold more than two million copies.

===''Stability with Growth'' (2006)===
In ''Stability with Growth: Macroeconomics, Liberalization and Development'', Stiglitz, [[José Antonio Ocampo]] (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue{{snd}} IPD), [[Ricardo Ffrench-Davis]] (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean{{snd}} [[ECLAC]]) and [[Deepak Nayyar]] (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) discuss the current debates on macroeconomics, capital market liberalization and development, and develop a new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the [[Washington Consensus]] has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith in the role of markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.

===''The Three Trillion Dollar War'' (2008)===
''[[The Three Trillion Dollar War]]'' (co-authored with [[Linda Bilmes]]) examines the full cost of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kevin|last=Perry |title=Joseph Stiglitz interview about ''The Three Trillion Dollar War'' |url=http://kevinegperry.com/2008/03/04/joseph-stiglitz-interview-the-3-trillion-war/ |publisher=[[The Beaver (newspaper)|The Beaver]] |date=March 4, 2008 |access-date=September 29, 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

===''Freefall'' (2010)===
{{Main|Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy}}

In ''Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy'', Stiglitz discusses the causes of the 2008 recession/depression and goes on to propose reforms needed to avoid a repetition of a similar crisis, advocating government intervention and regulation in a number of areas. Among the policy-makers he criticises are George W.

From the jacket: As those at the top continue to enjoy the best health care, education, and benefits of wealth, they often fail to realize that, as Joseph E. Stiglitz highlights, "their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live ... It does not have to be this way.  In ''[[The Price of Inequality]]'' Stiglitz lays out a comprehensive agenda to create a more dynamic economy and fairer and more equal society"

The book received the [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights]] 2013 Book Award, given annually to the book that "most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes{{snd}} his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity."<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Award |url=http://rfkcenter.org/book-award?lang=en |publisher=RFKcenter.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619072045/http://rfkcenter.org/book-award?lang=en |archive-date=2015-06-19 }}</ref>

===''Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth, Development, and Social Progress'' (2014)===
''Creating a Learning Society'' (co-authored with Bruce C. Greenwald) casts light on the significance of this insight for economic theory and policy. Taking as a starting point Kenneth J. Arrow's 1962 paper "Learning by Doing", they explain why the production of knowledge differs from that of other goods and why market economies alone typically do not produce and transmit knowledge efficiently. Closing knowledge gaps and helping laggards learn are central to growth and development. But creating a learning society is equally crucial if we are to sustain improved living standards in advanced countries.

===''The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them'' (2015)===
From the jacket: In ''The Great Divide'', Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book ''The Price of Inequality'' and suggests ways to counter America's growing problem. Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice{{snd}} the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities.

===''The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe'' (2016)===
From the description: "In 'The Euro', Nobel Prize-winning economist and best-selling author Joseph E. Stiglitz dismantles the prevailing consensus around what ails Europe, demolishing the champions of austerity while offering a series of plans that can rescue the continent--and the world--from further devastation."  According to book review aggregator [[Literary Hub]], it received pan reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Book Marks reviews of The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe by Joseph E.

===''People, Power and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent'' (2019)===
From the description: "We all have the sense that the American economy―and its government―tilts toward big business, but as Joseph E. Stiglitz explains in his new book, People, Power, and Profits, the situation is dire. A few corporations have come to dominate entire sectors of the economy, contributing to skyrocketing inequality and slow growth. This is how the financial industry has managed to write its own regulations, tech companies have accumulated reams of personal data with little oversight, and our government has negotiated trade deals that fail to represent the best interests of workers. Too many have made their wealth through exploitation of others rather than through wealth creation. If something isn’t done, new technologies may make matters worse, increasing inequality and unemployment.
Stiglitz identifies the true sources of wealth and of increases in standards of living, based on learning, advances in science and technology, and the rule of law. He shows that the assault on the judiciary, universities, and the media undermines the very institutions that have long been the foundation of America’s economic might and its democracy.
Helpless though we may feel today, we are far from powerless. In fact, the economic solutions are often quite clear. We need to exploit the benefits of markets while taming their excesses, making sure that markets work for us―the U.S. citizens―and not the other way around. If enough citizens rally behind the agenda for change outlined in this book, it may not be too late to create a progressive capitalism that will recreate a shared prosperity. Stiglitz shows how a middle-class life can once again be attainable by all.
An authoritative account of the predictable dangers of free market fundamentalism and the foundations of progressive capitalism, People, Power, and Profits shows us an America in crisis, but also lights a path through this challenging time."

===''Measuring What Counts; The Global Movement for Well-Being'' (2019)===
Stiglitz and his coauthors point out that the interrelated crises of environmental degradation and human suffering of our current age demonstrate that "something is fundamentally wrong with the way we assess economic performance and social progress." They argue that using GDP as the chief measure of our economic health does not provide an accurate assessment of the economy or the state of the world and the people living in it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Queally |first1=Jon |title='Everything Is Not Fine': Nobel Economist Calls on Humanity to End Obsession With GDP |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/25/everything-not-fine-nobel-economist-calls-humanity-end-obsession-gdp |website=Common Dreams |access-date=10 December 2019 |date=25 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stiglitz |first1=Joseph |title=It's time to retire metrics like GDP.

==Papers and conferences==
Stiglitz wrote a series of papers and held a series of conferences explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the [[World Bank]], Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.

==Awards and honors==
In addition to being awarded the Nobel Memorial prize, Stiglitz has over 40 honorary doctorates and at least eight honorary professorships as well as an honorary deanship.<ref name="cv">[http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/Stiglitz_CV.pdf Curriculum Vitae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513134138/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/Stiglitz_CV.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }}, Joseph E.
