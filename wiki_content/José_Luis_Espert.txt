'''José Luis Espert'''  (born November 21, 1961) is an Argentine [[economist]] and politician who is known to be one of the strongest supporters of the [[economic liberalism]] in [[Argentina]].<ref>{{cite web | title=José Luis Espert: Mauricio Macri no tenía nada que ver con el Liberalismo | website=[[Perfil]] | date=2020-08-09 | url= https://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/jose-luis-espert-mauricio-macri-no-tenia-nada-que-ver-con-el-liberalismo.phtml | language=es | access-date=2020-08-10}}</ref>

Espert proposes to deepen the [[free trade|commercial opening]] with the world and attacks against the limitations of [[Mercosur]]. He is against the "corporations that devour the country": as an anti-system, he proposes that the country "change the system for another." With his ideology, he seeks to position himself as the only representative of [[liberalism]].<ref>{{cite web | title=José Luis Espert.

[[File:EspertTN.png | thumb | 220x124px | right | Espert as a presidential candidate on television]]

He is very critical of the economic policies of the second presidency of [[Carlos Menem]] and the governments of [[Fernando de la Rúa]], [[Eduardo Duhalde]], [[Néstor Kirchner]], [[Cristina Fernández]] and [[Mauricio Macri]].

In December 2018 he officially launched his presidential campaign for the [[2019 Argentine general election]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/793700/actualidad/economista-espert-se-lanza-carrera-presidencial-contra-politicos-chorros.html|title=El economista Espert se lanza a la carrera presidencial contra los políticos chorros|first=La|last=Gaceta|website=www.lagaceta.com.ar}}</ref>

Espert's proposals consist of lowering public spending, forming an agency similar to the US Drug Control Administration to combat drug trafficking, lowering taxes, decriminalizing personal [[marijuana]] use, decriminalizing abortion and reforming the education system through [[School voucher|school vouchers]].

He opposes industrial promotion regimes and believes that the [[right to strike]] has gone too far, harmed even the worker himself. Therefore, he seeks a labor, tax and state reform in general. He also showed himself in favor of privatizing inefficient state companies and the retirement system, to turn it into an individual capitalization system such as in [[Chile]].
