'''Alfred DuPont Chandler Jr.''' (September 15, 1918 – May 9, 2007) was a professor of business history at [[Harvard Business School]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]], who wrote extensively about the scale and the management structures of modern corporations. His works redefined business and economic history of industrialization. He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] for his work, ''[[The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business]]'' (1977). He has been called "the doyen of American business historians".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21727049-1865-1896-saw-tumultuous-changes-new-oxford-history-united-states|title=How technology and capitalism shaped America after the civil war|newspaper=The Economist|date=24 August 2017}}</ref>

==Family and life==
Chandler was the great-grandson of [[Henry Varnum Poor]]. "Du Pont" was apparently a family name given to his grandfather because his great-grandmother was raised by the Du Pont family, and there are other connections as well.<ref>Carol May, "[http://ecfanews.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/alfred-du-pont-chandler-jr-by-carol-may/ Alfred du Pont Chandler Jr.]," Edmund's Community Courier ([http://ecfanews.wordpress.com/about/ Edmund Chandler Family Association]), March 2, 2010.</ref>

Chandler graduated from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in 1936 and [[Harvard College]] in 1940. After World War II, he returned to Harvard, finished his M.A. in 1946, and earned his doctorate in 1952 under the direction of [[Frederick Merk]]. He taught at [[M.I.T.]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] before arriving at [[Harvard Business School]] in 1970.

==Publications==
Chandler used the papers of his ancestor [[Henry Varnum Poor]], a leading analyst of the railway industry, the publisher of the ''[[American Railroad Journal]]'', and a founder of [[Standard & Poor's]], as a basis for his Ph.D. thesis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9184105 |title=Alfred Chandler |newspaper=The Economist |date=2007-05-17 |access-date=2011-09-19}}</ref>

Chandler began looking at large-scale enterprise in the early 1960s. His book ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise'' (1962) examined the organization of [[DuPont|E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and [[Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] He found that [[managerial]] [[organization]] developed in response to the [[corporation]]'s [[business strategy]]. The book was voted the eleventh most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the [[Academy of Management]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bedeian |first1= Arthur G. |last2= Wren |first2= Daniel A.|author-link1= Arthur G.

This emphasis on the importance of a cadre of managers to organize and run large-scale corporations was expanded into a "managerial revolution" in ''The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business'' (1977) for which he received a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. He pursued that book's themes further in ''Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism'', (1990) and co-edited an [[anthology]] on the same themes, with [[Franco Amatori]] and [[Takashi Hikino]], ''Big Business and the Wealth of Nations'' (1997).

==''The Visible Hand''==
Chandler's masterwork was ''[[The Visible Hand]]: The Managerial Revolution in American Business'' (1977). His first two chapters looked at traditional owner-operated small business operations in commerce and production, including the largest among them, the slave plantations in the South. Chapters 3-5 summarize the history of railroad management, with stress on innovations not just in technology but also in accounting, finance and statistics. He then turned to the new business operations made possible by the rail system in mass distribution, such as [[Jobber (merchandising)|jobbers]], department stores and mail order. A quick survey (ch 8) review mass innovation in mass production.The integration of mass distribution and mass production (ch 9-11) led to many mergers and the emergence of giant industrial corporations by 1900. Management for Chandler was much more than the CEO, it was the whole system of techniques and included middle management (ch 11) as well as the corporate structure of the biggest firms, Standard Oil, General Electric, US Steel, and DuPont (ch 13-14). Chandler argued that managerial firms evolved in order to take advantage of productive techniques available after the rail network was in place. These firms had a higher productivity and lower costs resulting in higher profits. The firms created the "managerial class" in America because they needed to coordinate the increasingly complex and interdependent system. According to Steven Usselman, this ability to achieve efficiency through coordination, and not some anti-competitive monopolistic greed by robber barons, explained the high levels of concentration in modern American industry.<ref>Steven W. Usselman, "Still Visible: Alfred D. Chandler's The Visible Hand," ''Technology and Culture'' 47, no. 3 (2006), 584-596.</ref>

==Organizational synthesis==
Along with economist [[Oliver E. Williamson]] and historians [[Louis Galambos]], [[Robert H. Wiebe]], and [[Thomas C. Cochran (historian)|Thomas C. Cochran]], Chandler was a leading historian of the notion of organizational synthesis.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 3114810|title = Technology, Political Economy, and Professionalization: Central Themes of the Organizational Synthesis|journal = Business History Review|volume = 57|issue = 4|pages = 471–493|last1 = Galambos|first1 = Louis|doi = 10.2307/3114810|year = 2012}}</ref>

He argued that during the 19th century, the development of new systems based on steam power and electricity created a [[Second Industrial Revolution]], which resulted in much more capital-intensive industries than had the industrial revolution of the previous century. The mobilization of the [[capital (economics)|capital]] necessary to exploit these new systems required a larger number of workers and managers, and larger physical plants than ever before. More particularly, the thesis of ''The Visible Hand'' is that, counter to other theses regarding how [[capitalism]] functions, administrative structure and managerial coordination replaced Adam Smith's "[[invisible hand]]" (market forces) as the core developmental and structuring impetus of modern business.

In the wake of this increase of industrial scale, three successful models of capitalism emerged, which Chandler associated with the three leading countries of the period: [[Great Britain]] ("personal capitalism"), the [[United States]] ("competitive capitalism") and [[Germany]] ("cooperative capitalism.")

Despite the important differences in these three models, the common thread among the developed nations is that the large industrial firm has been the engine of growth in three ways: first, it has provided focal points for capital and labor on large scales; second, it became the educator whereby a nation learned the pertinent technology and developed managerial skills; third, it served as the core around which medium and small firms that supply and serve it grew.

==Influence==
Chandler's work was somewhat ignored in history departments, but proved influential in business, economics, and sociology.<ref>Thomas K. McCraw, "Alfred Chandler: His Vision and Achievement," ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 207-226</ref>

In the business field, Chandler, along with [[Kenneth R. Andrews]] and [[Igor Ansoff]], has been credited with the foundational role in introducing and popularizing the concept of business strategy.<ref>Schendel, Dan E., and Hofer, Charles W., 1979, Strategic management. A new view of business policy and planning, Little Brown, Boston, p. 9.</ref><ref>Hatten, Kenneth J., Schendel, Dan E., and Cooper, Arnold C., 1978, A strategic model of the U.S. brewing industry: 1952-1971, Academy of Management Journal, vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 594.</ref><ref>Huff, Anne Sigismund, and Reger, Rhonda Kay, 1987, A review of strategic process research, Journal of Management, vol. 13, no. 2, p. 211.</ref><ref>McKiernan, Peter, 1997, Strategy past; strategy futures, Long Range Planning, vol. 30, no. 5, p. 792</ref> [[Chamberlain's Theory of Strategy]] cites Chandler's Strategy and Structure repeatedly as a source of key concepts.<ref>Chamberlain, Geoffrey P., 2010, Understanding Strategy, CreateSpace, Charleston, SC.</ref>

In sociology, prior to Chandler's research, some sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. Chandler's focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences, and this thesis has influenced organizational sociologists' work since the late 1970s. It also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique Chandler's work more closely, turning up instances in which Chandler assumed American corporations acted for reasons of efficiency, when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict.<ref>[[Neil Fligstein]], "Chandler and the Sociology of Organizations," ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 241-250</ref>
