==Award nomination and selection process==
{{Main|Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel}}
[[File:Nobel2008Economics news conference1.jpg|thumb|Announcement of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences 2008]]

According to its official website, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences "administers a researcher exchange with academies in other countries and publishes six scientific journals. Every year the Academy awards the Nobel Prizes in Physics and in Chemistry, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, the [[Crafoord Prize]] and a number of other large prizes".<ref name=nomaw/>

Each September the Academy's Economics Prize Committee, which consists of five elected members, "sends invitations to thousands of scientists, members of academies and university professors in numerous countries, asking them to nominate candidates for the Prize in Economics for the coming year. Members of the Academy and former laureates are also authorised to nominate candidates."<ref name="statutes-econ"/><ref name=nomaw/><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=Nomination and Selection of the Laureates in Economics|publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]]|url=http://nobelprize.org|access-date=18 October 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5EsureXKk?url=http://nobelprize.org/|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 April 2006}}</ref> All proposals and their supporting evidence must be received before February 1.<ref name="selectionProcess" /> The proposals are reviewed by the Prize Committee and specially appointed experts. Before the end of September, the committee chooses potential laureates. If there is a tie, the chairman of the committee casts the deciding vote. Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences vote in mid-October to determine the next laureate or laureates of the Prize in Economics.<ref name="statutes-econ" /><ref name=nomaw/><ref name="kva-members">{{cite web|title=Members |publisher=[[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] |url=http://www.kva.se/KVA_Root/eng/about/members/index.asp?br=ns&ver=6up |access-date=18 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504225908/http://www.kva.se/KVA_Root/eng/about/members/index.asp?br=ns&ver=6up |archive-date=May 4, 2008 }}</ref> As with the Nobel Prizes, no more than three people can share the prize for a given year; they must still be living at the time of the Prize announcement in October; and information about Prize nominations cannot be disclosed publicly for 50 years.<ref name="selectionProcess" />

Like the Nobel laureates in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics]], [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|physiology or medicine]], and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|literature]], each laureate in Economics receives a diploma, gold medal, and monetary grant award document from the [[Monarch of Sweden|King of Sweden]] at the annual Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in [[Stockholm]], on the anniversary of Nobel's death (December 10).<ref name="EB-NP"/><ref name="NF-ceremonies">{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize Award Ceremonies and Banquets|publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]]|url=http://nobelprize.org|access-date=7 November 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5EsureXKk?url=http://nobelprize.org/|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 April 2006}}</ref>

==Laureates==
{{main list|List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics}}

The first prize in economics was awarded in 1969 to [[Ragnar Frisch]] and [[Jan Tinbergen]] "for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes".<ref name="Winners1969">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5EsureXKk?url=http://nobelprize.org/|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 April 2006|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=28 October 2012}}</ref> Two women have received the prize: [[Elinor Ostrom]], who won in 2009, and [[Esther Duflo]], who won in 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.apnews.com/777efc95f30f41cc997ee47ce04c1c89 | title = 3 economists who study poverty win Nobel Prize | last1 = Wiseman | first1 = Paul | last2 = Ljubojevic | first2 = Aleksandar | last3 = LeBlanc | first3 = Steve | date = 14 October 2019 | website = apnews.com | publisher = Associated Press | access-date = 3 November 2019}}</ref>

==Awards to non-economists==
In February 1995, following acrimony within the selection committee pertaining to the awarding of the 1994 Prize in Economics to [[John Forbes Nash]], the Prize in Economics was redefined as a prize in social sciences. This made it available to researchers in such topics as political science, psychology, and sociology.<ref name=nasarmind372>[[#refNasarmind|Nasar, ''A Beautiful Mind'']], p. 372</ref><ref name=notnoble>{{Cite news|last=Brittan|first=Samuel|author-link=Samuel Brittan|title=The not so noble Nobel Prize|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=19 December 2003|url=http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/text172_p.html|access-date=26 November 2009}}</ref> Moreover, the composition of the Economics Prize Committee changed to include two non-economists. This has not been confirmed by the Economics Prize Committee. The members of the 2007 Economics Prize Committee are still dominated by economists, as the secretary and four of the five members are professors of economics.<ref name="NobelPrize-EconCommittee">{{cite web|title=The Economics Prize Committee|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|url=http://nobelprize.org|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5EsureXKk?url=http://nobelprize.org/|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 April 2006|access-date=8 January 2008}}</ref> In 1978, [[Herbert A. Simon]], whose [[PhD]] was in [[political science]], became the first non-economist to win the prize,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} while [[Daniel Kahneman]], a professor of psychology and public affairs at [[Princeton University]] is the first non-economist by profession to win the prize.

==Controversies and criticisms==
Some critics argue that the prestige of the Prize in Economics derives in part from its association with the Nobel Prizes, an association that has often been a source of controversy. Among them is the Swedish human rights lawyer [[Peter Nobel]], a great-grandnephew of [[Ludvig Nobel]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20050928/2173|title=Nobel descendant slams Economics prize|date=28 September 2005|work=thelocalsweden|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014012248/http://www.thelocal.se/2173/20050928/|archive-date=October 14, 2007|access-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> Nobel accuses the awarding institution of misusing his family's name, and states that no member of the Nobel family has ever had the intention of establishing a prize in economics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/norge/Alfred-Nobels-familie-tar-avstand-fra-okonomiprisen-552817b.html|title=Alfred Nobels familie tar avstand fra økonomiprisen|work=Aftenposten|access-date=2017-04-21}}</ref> He explained that "Nobel despised people who cared more about profits than society's well-being", saying that "There is nothing to indicate that he would have wanted such a prize", and that the association with the Nobel prizes is "a PR coup by economists to improve their reputation".<ref name=":0" />

According to [[Samuel Brittan]] of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', both former Swedish minister of finance ([[Kjell-Olof Feldt]]) and Swedish former minister of commerce ([[Gunnar Myrdal]]) wanted the prize abolished, saying, "Myrdal rather less graciously wanted the prize abolished because it had been given to such reactionaries as Hayek (and afterwards Milton Friedman)."<ref name="notnoble"/> Relatedly, it has been noted that several members of the [[Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|awarding committee]] have been affiliated with the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Nobel Factor: The Prize in Economics, Social Democracy, and the Market Turn|last1=Offer|first1=Avner|last2=Söderberg|first2=Gabriel|date=2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|edition=1st|pages=104–105}}</ref>

In his speech at the 1974 Nobel Prize banquet, [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated that had he been consulted on the establishment of a Nobel Prize in economics, he would "have decidedly advised against it"<ref name="notnoble"/><ref name=hayekbanquet>{{cite web|first=Friedrich|last=von Hayek|author-link=Friedrich von Hayek|title=Friedrich von Hayek: Banquet Speech|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|date=10 December 1974|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1974/hayek-speech.html|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5EsureXKk?url=http://nobelprize.org/|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 April 2006|access-date=27 November 2009}}</ref> primarily because, "The Nobel Prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to possess.... This does not matter in the natural sciences. Here the influence exercised by an individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts; and they will soon cut him down to size if he exceeds his competence. But the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an influence over laymen: politicians, journalists, civil servants and the public generally."<ref name=hayekbanquet/>

Critics cite the apparent snub of [[Joan Robinson]] as evidence of the [[Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|committee]]'s bias towards [[mainstream economics]],<ref name=NasarNYT>{{cite news|first=Sylvia|last=Nasar|title=The Sometimes Dismal Nobel Prize in Economics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/13/business/13PRIZ.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 October 2001|access-date=13 September 2011|quote=[Ms. Robinson] did not win the prize because [the committee] feared that she would either refuse it or, worse, use the Nobel limelight to attack mainstream economics.}}</ref><ref name=Millmow>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Millmow|title=An IgNobel Scandal|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/wholeissues/issue13.htm|publisher=Post-Autistic Economics Review|date=2 May 2002|access-date=18 October 2007}}</ref> though [[heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] like [[Friedrich Hayek]] ([[Austrian School]]) and [[Ronald Coase]] (associated with [[new institutional economics]]) have won.{{dubious|date=August 2019}}
