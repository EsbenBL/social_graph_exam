'''Kevin Miles Murphy''' (born 1958) is the [[George Stigler|George J. Stigler]] Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]] and a Senior Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]].<ref>[http://www.hoover.org/profiles/kevin-m-murphy    Profile at Hoover Institution]</ref>

In 1997 Murphy was awarded the prestigious [[John Bates Clark Medal]] by the [[American Economic Association]], given once every two years to the most outstanding American economist under the age of forty, and widely considered to be the second most prestigious prize in economics (after the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]]).  Murphy was cited for his study of the causes of growing income inequality between white-collar and [[blue-collar worker]]s in the United States and his research linking the growth in income inequality to growth in the demand for skilled labor. His other research has covered such topics as economic growth, income inequality, valuing medical research, [[rational addiction]], and unemployment.

Murphy has authored over 50 published articles on a variety of topics including a costâ€“benefit analysis of the war in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.chicagogsb.edu/magazine/vol29/issue01/cover.aspx Chicago GSB Magazine: Winter 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706130823/http://www.chicagogsb.edu/magazine/vol29/issue01/cover.aspx |date=July 6, 2007 }}</ref>

On September 20, 2005, he was named as one of the 2005 recipients of the [[Macarthur Grant#MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellowship]], often referred to as the "genius grant."

''Education'': B.A. (economics, ''[[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]]''), [[University of California, Los Angeles]], 1981; PhD, [[University of Chicago]], 1986 (thesis: ''Specialization and Human Capital'').
