Beginning in 2013, Gilbert appeared in a series of [[Prudential Financial]] television commercials that used [[data visualization]] to get Americans to think about the importance of saving for their retirements. For example, in one advertisement, people were asked to put stickers on a time-line to indicate the age of the oldest person they knew to illustrate the recent increase in life expectancy. In another, Gilbert started a chain-reaction and set a Guinness World Record<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.prudential.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=6966|title=Prudential Newsroom: Home|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722012436/http://news.prudential.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=6966|archive-date=2015-07-22}}</ref> by toppling a {{convert|30|ft|m|0|adj=on}} domino to illustrate the power of compound interest. In a third, people put magnets on walls marked "Past" and "Future" to illustrate the optimism bias.

=== Scholarly Articles ===
Gilbert has also collaborated with other scholars on articles published in academic journals like ''[[Psychological Science]]'', ''[[Social Cognition (journal)|Social Cognition]]'', and ''[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]''.

==== "How Happy Was I, Anyway?' A Retrospective Impact Bias," ''Social Cognition'' (2003) ====

* Gilbert wrote "'How Happy Was I, Anyway?' A Retrospective Impact Bias" with Timothy D. Wilson and Jay Meyers in ''Social Cognition'' in 2003.  The article included the scholars' study that found that humans believe their futures have more of a direct effect on their emotions and mood than future events actually do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Meyers|first2=Jay|last3=Gilbert|first3=Daniel T.|date=December 2003|title="How Happy Was I, Anyway?"

==== "The Least Likely of Times: How Remembering the Past Biases Forecasts of the Future," ''Psychological Science'' (2005) ====

* In ''Psychological Science'', Gilbert contributed to "The Least Likely of Times: How Remembering the Past Biases Forecasts of the Future" in 2005, which included studies that demonstrated that people rely on memories of past events when predicting and thinking about their futures. The study also concluded that people primarily rely on memorable but unique and atypical life events to make these sort of predictions about their futures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=Carey K.|last2=Gilbert|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Wilson|first3=Timothy D.|date=2005-08-01|title=The Least Likely of Times: How Remembering the Past Biases Forecasts of the Future|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=16|issue=8|pages=626–630|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01585.x|pmid=16102065|s2cid=9589696|issn=0956-7976}}</ref>

==== "Affective Forecasting: Knowing What to Want," ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'' (2005) ====

* Gilbert co-authored "Affective Forecasting: Knowing What to Want" with Timothy D. Wilson in 2005 in ''Current Directions in Psychological Science''. In this piece, the two scholars studied how humans make all life choices with a lens that leads them to consider how that decision would impact their future happiness. Gilbert and Wilson call this tendency to base decisions off of their impact on eventual feelings "affective forecasts." The study also took into account impact bias, or when people miscalculate how much or how little a future event will affect one's levels of happiness. However, the two could not definitively claim whether or not these affective forecasts had a positive impact on human lives in practice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Gilbert|first2=Daniel T.|date=June 2005|title=Affective Forecasting|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=14|issue=3|pages=131–134|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00355.x|s2cid=18373805|issn=0963-7214}}</ref>

==== "A Wrinkle in Time: Asymmetric Valuation of Past and Future Events," ''Psychological Science'' (2008) ====

* In 2008, Gilbert co-authored "A Wrinkle in Time: Asymmetric Valuation of Past and Future Events" in ''Psychological Science'', which included Gilbert's studies conducted with Eugene M. Caruso and [[Timothy Wilson|Timothy D. Wilson]] that illustrated that humans value future events more than past events.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Caruso|first1=Eugene M.|last2=Gilbert|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Wilson|first3=Timothy D.|date=August 2008|title=A Wrinkle in Time|journal=Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=8|pages=796–801|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02159.x|pmid=18816287|s2cid=15365315|issn=0956-7976}}</ref>
