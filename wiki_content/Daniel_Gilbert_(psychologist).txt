Beginning in 2013, Gilbert appeared in a series of [[Prudential Financial]] television commercials that used [[data visualization]] to get Americans to think about the importance of saving for their retirements. For example, in one advertisement, people were asked to put stickers on a time-line to indicate the age of the oldest person they knew to illustrate the recent increase in life expectancy. In another, Gilbert started a chain-reaction and set a Guinness World Record<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.prudential.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=6966|title=Prudential Newsroom: Home|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722012436/http://news.prudential.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=6966|archive-date=2015-07-22}}</ref> by toppling a {{convert|30|ft|m|0|adj=on}} domino to illustrate the power of compound interest. In a third, people put magnets on walls marked "Past" and "Future" to illustrate the optimism bias.
