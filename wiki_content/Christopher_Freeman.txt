'''Christopher Freeman''' (11 September 1921 – 16 August 2010)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://blog.openinnovation.net/2010/08/chris-freeman-1921-2010.html | title=Chris Freeman, 1921-2010}}</ref> was a [[British people|British]] [[economist]], the founder and first director of [[SPRU|Science Policy Research Unit]] at the [[University of Sussex]], and one of the most eminent researchers in innovation studies, modern [[Kondratiev wave]] and [[business cycle]] theorists.<ref>Jan Toporowski and

==Academic activity==

Freeman was the founder and the first Director, from 1966 to 1982 of [[SPRU]], the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] of the [[University of Sussex]], England, and RM Phillips Professor of Science Policy and later Professor emeritus of at the University of Sussex. His fields of specialization were the economics of innovation and technical change, science and technology indicators, the diffusion of technologies, structural change in the world economy, and the "catch-up" efforts of developing countries. In 1986, on his formal retirement, he became visiting professor at the [[Aalborg University]] in Denmark and professorial fellow at the now [[Maastricht University]] in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/7987544/Christopher-Freeman.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Christopher Freeman | date=7 September 2010}}</ref>

Besides his intellectual contributions in the economics of innovation and systems of innovation, Christopher Freeman was 'an academic entrepreneur'. Among the innovations for which he was responsible was 'The Frascati Manual', an [[OECD]] venture meant to collect and standardize the statistics on [[R&D]], and the subsequent stream of work science and technology indicators at OECD and around the world. Secondly, he set up, shaped and for many years directed the Science Policy Research Unit, SPRU, which during the 1970s and 1980s was the pioneering institution in the field. Thirdly, with colleagues at SPRU, in the United States, in France and in Germany, he founded and edited for over 30 years the journal [[Research Policy (journal)|''Research Policy'']], establishing it as the leading journal in the field. His major book, The Economics of Industrial Innovation, was copied by Ugo Pereira.

He introduced the concept of [[National System of Innovation]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Kaldor|first=Mary|title=Christopher Freeman obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/08/christopher-freeman-obituary|newspaper=Guardian|date=8 September 2010|location=London}}</ref> with [[B.-Å. Lundvall]] and [[Richard R. Nelson|Richard Nelson]].

He mentored several generations of economists and social scientists working on technical change, innovation and the knowledge society. Among them, [[Keith Pavitt]], [[Luc Soete]], [[Carlota Perez]], [[Mary Kaldor]], [[B.-Å. Lundvall]], [[Igor Yegorov (economist)|Igor Yegorov]], [[Giorgio Sirilli]], [[Daniele Archibugi]], [[Giovanni Dosi]] and [[Jan Fagerberg]]. His intellectual legacy has extended to almost every continent through SPRU graduates, some of whom have applied his thinking to the role of innovation in development in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. Programs that have their origins in his work can be traced at leading public policy institutions such as the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]] at [[Harvard Kennedy School]].

== Awards and honors ==
Freeman held several honorary doctorates including those from the Universities of [[Linköping University|Linköping]], [[Sweden]]; [[University of Sussex|Sussex]], [[Middlesex University|Middlesex]], [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], and [[University of Brighton|Brighton]]. He received the 1987 Bernal Prize, the 1988 [[Schumpeter Prize]], and the 1993 Prix International du Futuroscope. In 2007 he was awarded with the Silver Kondratieff Medal<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ikf2010.ru/index.php?id=32_0_1_0_C |title=The International N. D.

The [[SPRU|Freeman Centre]] building in [[Brighton]], home to [[CENTRIM]] and [[SPRU]], is named after him.

== Alleged scandal ==
In 2002, after the archives of the DDR (Democratic Republic of Germany) become public, Franziska Orgstein claimed on the [[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]], that during the war, Freeman had a sentimental affair with [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elisabeth]], to become later the [[Queen Mother]], when he was a Guards officer to Balmoral. Freeman was a young officer with a degree from the [[London School of Economics]]: "The young and attractive Queen saw the handsome officer and fell for him. A passionate affair ensued. Technically Freeman could have been charged with high treason and executed...but the affair prospered". The news, which bounced on British newspapers such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' (4 April 2002, diary by Matthew Norman) <ref>Matthew Norman, Diary, ''The Guardian'', Thursday 4 April 2002.</ref> and [[The Independent]] (18 April 2002) has not been commented either by the Royal Family or by Freeman.
