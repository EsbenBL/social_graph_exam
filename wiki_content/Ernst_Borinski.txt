In 1980 the Southern Sociological Society made Borinski the third person on its "Roll of Honor," its "greatest recognition."

During his final years, Borinski began to reduce his workload due to age, but managed to teach one course each spring semester until he died on May 26, 1983 at the age of 81. He is buried at a small cemetery on the Tougaloo campus.<ref name='Clarion-Ledger-Obit'/><ref name='Swastika'/>

==Legacy==
There is a building complex on Tougaloo's campus named after him.<ref name='Swastika'/>

In January 2000, Tougaloo sponsored their first annual history conference in his honor. The Mississippi [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] gives out an annual award in his name.<ref name='Swastika'/>

Borinski is one of the subjects profiled in the documentary, ''[[From Swastika to Jim Crow]]'', which looks at Jewish refugee scholars who taught at [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black colleges]] in the mid-20th Century.<ref name='Swastika'/>
