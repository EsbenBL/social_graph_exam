'''Alternative Theory of Organization and Management''' (ATOM) - propose an approach to [[organization]] and [[management]] as a [[science]], designed and developed by [[Seweryn Chajtman]]. ATOM concept arose from a need to clarify, the adoption and widespread recognition of the laws and regularity, based on strict criteria. The rationale for its creation are:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chajtman|first=S.|year=1995|title=Krytyka i zmiana paradygmatów w naukach o organizacji i zarzadzaniu|trans-title=Criticism and the paradigms shift in the science of organizing and managing|journal=Organizacja i Kierowanie| volume=4|publisher=The Committee of Organization and Management Sciences, Polish Academy of Sciences|location=Warsaw|issn=0137-5466|language=Polish}}</ref>

:* huge accumulation of knowledge dispersed in the specialist literature of many fields and [[Academic discipline|disciplines]],
:* excessive one-sidedness still emerging of partial approaches,
:* lack of synthetic, coherent approach, which integrates various views on the organization and management,
:* necessity to establish of the basic [[paradigm]]s of the organization and management, including in relation to issues such as: subject of organization and management, dominant position of the work [[Systems engineering process|processes]], classification of [[management functions]], partition the [[system]] into subsystems, process-modelling of the system, the relationship between the concepts of 'organization' and 'management', impartial classification of schools and directions.

== The subject of the organization and management ==

[[File:Tab00 en.jpg|thumbnail|Table 1. Ergo-transformational systems location in the system classifications]]

; Ergo-transformational process: A [[sequence]] of mutually dependent states of material transitions, occurring under the influence of purposeful actions of a person who participates in this process (or have been designed and running by a person) and under the influence of the functioning equipment. As a result, the input material is transformed into the desired output product.

; Ergo-transformational system: The system of purposeful processing of material objects and/or information, which is regulated (or controlled) by human.

'''The subject of the organization and management''' are only and exclusively ergo-transformational systems and ergo-transformational processes. Essential nature of the ergo-transformational systems and ergo-transformational processes are the products that have been purposeful created. These are material objects or information.<ref>This assertion replace widespread view that the purpose of organization and management is a 'work process' or any other views on this topic.</ref>

Location of ergo-transformational systems in the classification of systems, shows Table 1. Classification criterion is the degree of human intervention (involvement) in the system.

== Law and regularity ==

=== Law of the ergo-transformational process structure: three related sequences of change ===

[[File:Tab01 en.jpg|thumbnail|Table 2. Process classification of the ergo-transformational system depending on gradation of intentional goals and on relationships resulting from servicing]]

[[File:Tab02 en.jpg|thumbnail|Table 3. Process classification of the ergo-transformational system due to the nature of the material being processed]]

Any ergo-transformational process is the [[:wikt:synthesis|synthesis]], the integration of three components, running parallel and mutually coupled sequences – sub-processes involved. They are:

:* the sequence of the state transitions of material [M],
:* the sequence of human activities directly involved in the process (or the people directly involved in the process) [H],
:* the sequence of state transitions of equipment and tools (functioning of equipment and tools) [E].

This law deserves to be called '''the first basic law of organization and management'''. Consistently arise from it further logical regularity.

Process classification of the ergo-transformational system depending on gradation of intentional goals and on relationships resulting from servicing, shows Table 2. Are distinguished the following types of processes:

: A) the Primary Processes (P<sub>pri</sub>),
: B1) the Auxiliary Processes (P<sub>aux</sub>),
: B2) the Information Processes (P<sub>inf</sub>).

Due to the nature of the processed objects can be distinguished processes for matter processing, and a processes for information [[data processing]] (see Table 3).

=== Law of the servicing by the Auxiliary Processes P<sub>aux</sub> ===

The functioning of any ergo-transformational process requires servicing the sequence of human activities 'H' and the sequence of functioning of equipment and tools 'E', by the P<sub>aux</sub> processes. One may to distinguish four categories of P<sub>aux</sub> processes:

# The processes of repairs and maintenance of equipment (P<sub>rep</sub>)
# The processes of servicing of tools (P<sub>t</sub>)
# The processes of energy service (P<sub>en</sub>)
# The processes of servicing of people (P<sub>H</sub>)

As belonging to one of the categories of ergo-transformational processes, each Paux process also requires servicing by other auxiliary processes, unless did it himself.

=== Law of the servicing by the Information Processes P<sub>inf</sub> ===

[[File:Rys01 en.jpg|thumbnail|Figure 1. A logical model of the ergo-transformational process]]

Functioning of any ergo-transformational process is dependent on the integration of its three sequences through servicing by the P<sub>inf</sub> processes. Segmentation of ergo-transformational process for consecutive operations also requires servicing by the binding P<sub>inf</sub> processes. Therefore, any ergo-transformational process requires servicing by three kinds of P<sub>inf</sub>:

# P<sub>inf</sub> processes binding three sequences of ergo-transformational process within individual operations
# P<sub>inf</sub> processes binding subsequent operations within ergo-transformational process
# P<sub>inf</sub> processes binding processes of the ergo-transformational system

Any P<sub>inf</sub> process as a special category of ergo-transformational process, also requires servicing by other P<sub>inf</sub> process (and of course, by other P<sub>aux</sub> processes), unless did it himself. Figure 1 presents a logical model of the ergo-transformational process.

=== Law of multi-dimensional decomposition and synthesis of ergo-transformational systems ===

[[File:Rys02 en.jpg|thumbnail|Figure 2. Schema of the ergo-transformational system model]]

Law of multi-dimensional decomposition and synthesis of ergo-transformational systems can be define as '''the second basic law of organization and management'''. The primary issue of identification or designing each ergo-transformational system (new or improved) is their accurate decomposition into [[subsystem]]s. Arbitrary decomposition into subsystems is methodologically unacceptable, as not based on precise criteria.

ATOM not treat the system as a 'flat' configuration, but as a 'spatial', taken from several points of view - as separate, although reciprocally incorporated 'sectional views' (reflections), depending on separable criteria of decomposition. It is assumed that these cuts may be many, but so far succeeded established only four criteria (sectional views and structures):

# The first sectional view considers the system as the structure of all processes occurring in system: S<sup>1</sup> = {{angbr|P<sub>pri</sub>; P<sub>aux</sub>; P<sub>inf</sub>; R<sup>1</sup>}}.
# The second sectional view refers to the structure of all the resources participating in the system (materials and products [M], people [H], equipment and tools [E], information resources [D], capital and financial resources (free financial resources) [F] ): S<sup>2</sup> = {{angbr|M; H; E; D; F; R<sup>2</sup>}}.
# The third sectional view reflects the hierarchical structure of all organizational units (primary, auxiliary and informational) that make up the ergo-transformational system: S<sup>3</sup> = {{angbr|K<sub>pri</sub>; K<sub>aux</sub>; K<sub>inf</sub>; R<sup>3</sup>}}.
# The fourth sectional view presents the dynamics of subsequent stages of the development of the system - from the design of the facility and preparing the way through the stage of implementation and normal operation until the changes or possible [[liquidation]] of the system: S<sup>4</sup> = {{angbr|S<sup>1</sup>; S<sup>2</sup>; S<sup>3</sup>; R<sup>4</sup>}}.

The individual sectional views belong to the relational configuration of the system: Sn = {{angbr|S<sup>1</sup>; S<sup>2</sup>; S<sup>3</sup>; S<sup>4</sup>; ... ; R<sup>1...n</sup>}}. Figure 2 cites the schema of system model.

=== Law of phasic structure of integral Information Process ===

[[File:Tab03 en.jpg|thumbnail|Table 4. The next phases of any ergo-transformational process]]

[[File:Rys03 en.jpg|thumbnail|Figure 3. Relationships between the phases of the information process and parameters of other serviced processes]]

Law of phasic structure of entire Information Process can be described as '''the third basic law of organization and management'''. It is a prelude to determine the further regularity of designing of the information subsystems.

The essence of any Information Processes (P<sub>inf</sub>) is servicing of other processes or objects. In any integral Pinf process there are four consecutive phases:

# Phase of prospective preparation products [[parameter]]s serviced processes, the methods of achieving and other factors (normative N<sub>1</sub>),
# Phase of the planning serviced processes (N<sub>p</sub>),
# Phase of current state records and results of running serviced processes, once operational (Rec),
# Phase of the control and adjustment serviced processes.

A more detailed interpretation of the successive phases of any P<sub>inf</sub> process, presents Table 4. Figure 3 shows the relationships between the phases of the Information Process and parameters of serviced processes.

=== Regularity of the links between processes. Models of relationships. ===

[[File:Rys04 en.jpg|thumbnail|Figure 4. An example model of linkages and couplings between the serviced and servicing processes of the ergo-transformational system]]

These regularity and the models are a consequence resulting from the previously specified laws, i. e.: the law of the process structure (three related sequences of changes), the law of unavoidable servicing of two sequences by a specialized Auxiliary Processes (P<sub>aux</sub>) and the law of the sequence servicing by the relevant Information Processes (P<sub>inf</sub>). There can be many variants of the possible combinations of servicing of processes and coupling of processes. In any case, always spaces the law of servicing of everyone without exception ergo-transformational processes. Figure 4 presents an example model of linkages and couplings between the serviced and servicing processes of the ergo-transformational system.

=== Regularity of combinatorics any kind of processes in any ergo-transformational system ===

[[File:Rys05 en.svg|thumbnail|Figure 5. Mutual relationships between Primary Processes (P<sub>pri</sub>), Auxiliary Processes (P<sub>aux</sub>) and Information Processes (P<sub>inf</sub>) in ergo-transformational system]]

In any ergo-transformational system it is unavoidable occurrence of a set of Primary Processes (P<sub>pri</sub>), Auxiliary Processes (P<sub>aux</sub>) and Information Processes (P<sub>inf</sub>). Depending on the nature of the processed materials is grouped processes for matter processing, and a processes for information processing. Figure 5 refers to the mutual relationships between Primary Processes (P<sub>pri</sub>), Auxiliary Processes (P<sub>aux</sub>) and Information Processes (P<sub>inf</sub>) in ergo-transformational system.

== Management as a special kind of Information Process ==

The regularity of the above shows that the management can only logically be interpreted as a P<sub>inf</sub> process higher degree. This process coordinates several P<sub>inf</sub> processes on lower degree. Particularly relevant to management processes is its integrity; they must take into account comprehensive the requirements for control of all Primary Processes (P<sub>pri</sub>), Auxiliary Processes (P<sub>aux</sub>) and Information Processes (P<sub>inf</sub>) and cover all four phases and components of Information Process.

According to gradation of linkages and coupling of ergo-transformational processes, process of management is a P<sub>inf</sub> process at least 3rd degree (P<sub>inf</sub> ≥ 3), co-ordinating Information Processes at least 2nd degree (P<sub>inf</sub> ≥ 2). Information Processes lower degree (P<sub>inf</sub> ≤ 2) can be oriented to either phase or part of an integrated Information Process, or to control of one kind of the process in ergo-transformational system.

It follows, that the term 'organization' in the sense of functional can be interpreted as each Information Processes of at all levels in ergo-transformational system. For example, a worker at the workplace, master, technologist, engineer, clerk, planner, controller, etc., certainly are involved in the organization, but do not always have to be a 'management', which is the domain of information processes of higher degrees, usually associated with higher levels of management.
