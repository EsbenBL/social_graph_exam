Woodford calls his own framework 'neo-Wicksellian', and he titled his textbook on monetary policy in homage to Wicksell's work.

==''Interest and Prices''==
Woodford is probably best known as the author of an advanced textbook on monetary macroeconomics entitled ''Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woodford|first=Michael |year=2003 |title=Interest and prices: Foundations of a theory of monetary policy |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01049-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Green |first=Edward |year=2005 |doi=10.1257/0022051053737799 |title=A review of ''Interest and Prices'' |journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]] |volume=43 |pages=121–134 }}</ref> The book has, in the words of the Deutsche Bank Prize Committee, "quickly become the standard reference for monetary theory and analysis among academic economists and their colleagues at central banks."<ref name=deutsche>{{cite web |url=https://www.ifk-cfs.de/index.php?id=939 |title=Michael Woodford: The Prize Winner 2007 |date=October 4, 2007 }}</ref> The title ''Interest and Prices'' is a direct translation of ''Geldzins und Güterpreise'' the title of a book published by Wicksell in German 1898 and translated into English 1923.<ref>{{Cite web|last=kanopiadmin|date=2014-08-18|title=Interest and Prices|url=https://mises.org/library/interest-and-prices|access-date=2021-11-16|website=Mises Institute|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sanger|first=C.
