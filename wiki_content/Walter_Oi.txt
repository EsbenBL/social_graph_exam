'''Walter Yasuo Oi''' (July 1, 1929 – December 24, 2013) was the Elmer B. Milliman Professor of [[Economics]] at the [[University of Rochester]] in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a distinguished fellow of the Society of Labor Economists, and a recipient of the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service. He is credited with providing the economic basis for a [[voluntary military]] and the elimination of a [[Conscription|draft]].

==Early life==
Oi was born in [[Los Angeles, California]].  He obtained a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Economics]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1961.

At age 13, Oi and his family were detained by U.S. authorities and sent along with other Japanese-Americans to an internment camp, for fear that they might aid Imperial Japan in World War II. For the first few days of his internment, Oi and his family lived in a stall at [[Santa Anita Park]].

Oi began to lose his sight in the 1960s, as he finished his doctoral work and began searching for a faculty position.

==Role in the development of an all volunteer force==
In his contribution to ''The Costs and Implications of an All-Volunteer Force'' (1967) (of which he was also editor) Oi outlined the different calculations required to differentiate between the budgetary cost of military personnel and the economic cost to the nation of [[conscription]]. He identified the hidden costs of drafted force as the impact on the mental well being of those drafted. Oi estimated the loss in monetary terms of this effect to be between $826 million and $1.134 billion.<ref>Henderson, [http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/523/1/159 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft], p. 363.</ref>

Oi was then employed as the staff economist on President Nixon's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force (the Gates  Commission) in the early 1970s. His research was used as a key piece of evidence in the debate to end the policy of conscription.<ref name="press">[http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=642 Conference Organized to Honor Economist Walter Oi]</ref> Conscription ended in 1973.<ref>Henderson, [http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/523/1/159 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft], p. 362.</ref>

==Role in relation to disability==

==Awards and honors==
Oi was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1993. Oi was named a distinguished fellow of the [[American Economic Association]], a distinguished fellow of the Society of Labor Economists, and a fellow of the Econometrics Society.  In 2000, Oi received the [[Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service]] for his work leading to the adoption of an all-volunteer military.<ref name=rochester>{{cite web | title=Walter Oi, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Economics, Dead at 84 |url=http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=8002| date=2013-12-27}}</ref>

==Personal==
During [[World War II]], Oi was [[Japanese American internment|interned]] at the [[Granada War Relocation Center|Granada internment camp]]<ref name=archives>{{cite web | title=Japanese American Internee Data File: Walter Oi|url=https://aad.archives.gov/aad/record-detail.jsp?dt=3099&mtch=6&tf=F&q=Oi&bc=&rpp=10&pg=1&rid=65589&rlst=65589,65584,65585,65586,65587,65588| publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]| accessdate=2019-08-17}}</ref> since he was a [[Nisei]], an American of second generation [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent.

Oi was totally [[Blindness|blind]] after 1956 but continued to defy his handicap through his work.  He had been gradually losing his sight for the majority of his life and unable to read text since entering college.  He continued to teach, collaborate and work despite his blindness until he died, aged 84, in Rochester, NY.
