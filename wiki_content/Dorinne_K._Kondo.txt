== Career ==
Kondo's is a professor and she has started her career as being an Assistant Professor of Anthropology in Harvard University for seven years from 1982 to 1989. Then she became a MacArthur Associate Professor of Women's Studies and Anthropology, later on she was appointed to be a Full Professor in 1997 at [[Pomona College]]. She is now a Professor of Anthropology and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California and she has been at the University of Southern California since 1997.<ref name=":0" />

Her career mainly focused on gender studies and ethnology as she has now portrayed her knowledge on discrimination and gender inequality in her dramaturge and playwright. Kondo's art works, which are her playwrights that she has wrote, have been shedding light on the discrimination on Asians in the theatre and fashion world. Kondo has mentioned multiple times on social media that what has happened in the past cannot be changed but with raising awareness using her playwrights, she thinks there is a chance for social change and to progressively end inequality.

In her creative and innovative book ''Worldmaking: Race, Performance and the Work of Creativity'', Dorinne Kondo guesses the racialized constructions of imbalance that pervade theater and the arts. Grounded in twenty years of hands on work as dramaturge and writer, Kondo activates critical race researches, influence hypothesis, analysis, and emotional composition to abrasively break down performance center's work of inventiveness as hypothesis: acting, writing, and dramaturgy. Race-making happens behind the stage in the imaginative cycle and through economic forces, institutional hierarchy, recruiting practices, philosophies of creative greatness, and tasteful structure. For the audience, expressions of the arts produce racial effect fundamentally over-determined ways influence can enhance or diminish life. Overturning class through insightful understanding, distinctive vignettes, and Kondo's unique play, worldmaking ventures from an underlying sentiment with theater that is broken by experiences with prejudice, toward what Kondo calls reparative inventiveness. Worldmaking plays out the potential for expressions of the arts to change worlds, from theater worlds to psychic worlds to worldmaking dreams for social change.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dorinne Kondo|url=https://dorinnekondo.com/|access-date=2021-04-28|website=Dorinne Kondo|language=en-US}}</ref>

Her other book ''About face'' analyzes representations of Asia and their resonations in both Asia and Asian American lives. Japanese high fashion and Asian American theater become points of passage into the political issues of pleasure, the presentation of racial personalities, the possibility of political intervention in commodity capitalism. In view of Kondo's hands on work, this interdisciplinary work unites papers, interviews with fashioner Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons and dramatist David Henry Hwang, and "individual" vignettes in its investigation of counter-orientalism.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Face|url=https://dorinnekondo.com/new-page-1|access-date=2021-04-28|website=Dorinne Kondo|language=en-US}}</ref>

Paul H. Noguchi an American Anthropologist commented on Kondo's book ''Crafting sleeves'':

''"The ethnography of Japan is currently being reshaped by a new generation of Japanologists, and the present work certainly deserves a place in this body of literature. . . . The combination of utility with beauty makes Kondo’s book required reading, for those with an interest not only in Japan but also in reflexive anthropology, women’s studies, field methods, the anthropology of work, social psychology, Asian Americans, and even modern literature."''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo3774610.html|title=Crafting Selves}}</ref>
