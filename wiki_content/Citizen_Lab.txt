The '''Citizen Lab''' is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the [[Munk School of Global Affairs]] at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada. Founded and directed by Professor [[Ronald Deibert]], the Citizen Lab studies information controls—such as [[network surveillance]] and content filtering—that impact the openness and security of the Internet and that pose threats to [[human rights]].<ref name=Bpr2012-10-21/> The Citizen Lab collaborates with research centres, organizations, and individuals around the world, and uses a "mixed methods" approach, which combines computer-generated interrogation, [[data mining]], and analysis with intensive [[field research]], qualitative [[social science]], and legal and [[policy analysis]] methods.

The Citizen Lab was a founding partner of the [[OpenNet Initiative]] (2002–2013) and the [[Information Warfare Monitor]] (2002–2012) projects. The organization also developed the original design of the [[Psiphon]] censorship circumvention software, which was spun out of the Lab into a private Canadian corporation (Psiphon Inc.) in 2008.

The Citizen Lab's research outputs have made global news headlines around the world, including front page exclusives in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. In ''Tracking [[GhostNet]]'' (2009), researchers uncovered a suspected [[cyber espionage]] network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries, a high percentage of which were high-value targets, including [[ministries of foreign affairs]], embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ghostnet.pdf |title=Tracking Ghostnet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network |access-date=March 24, 2014}}</ref> This seminal study was one of the first public reports to reveal a cyber espionage network that targeted [[civil society]] and government systems around the world. In ''Shadows in the Cloud'' (2010), researchers documented a complex ecosystem of cyber espionage that systematically compromised government, business, academic, and other computer network systems in [[India]], the offices of the [[Dalai Lama]], the [[United Nations]], and several other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.scribd.com/doc/29435784/SHADOWS-IN-THE-CLOUD-Investigating-Cyber-Espionage-2-0 |title=Shadows in the Cloud: Investigating Cyber Espionage 2.0 |access-date=March 24, 2014}}</ref> In ''Million Dollar Dissident'',<ref name="citizenlab_NSO_20160824"/> published in August 2016, researchers discovered that [[Ahmed Mansoor]], one of the [[UAE Five]], a human rights defender in the United Arab Emirates, was targeted with software developed by Israeli "cyber war" company [[NSO Group]]. Using a chain of [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day]] exploits, operators of this spyware attempted to get Mansoor to click on a link in a socially engineered text message that would have given them access to everything in his phone. Prior to the releases of the report, researchers contacted Apple who released a security update that patched the vulnerabilities exploited by the spyware operators.

The Citizen Lab has won a number of awards for its work. It is the first Canadian institution to win the [[MacArthur Foundation]]’s MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions (2014)<ref>{{cite web | title = MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions: The Citizen Lab | url =  http://www.macfound.org/maceirecipients/80/ | date = February 19, 2014 | access-date=March 24, 2014}}</ref> and the only Canadian institution to receive a "New Digital Age" Grant (2014) from [[Google]] Executive Chairman [[Eric Schmidt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2014/03/google-executive-chairman-eric-schmidt-awards-citizen-lab-new-digital-age-grant/ |title=Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt Awards Citizen Lab "New Digital Age" Grant  | date = March 10, 2014 | access-date= March 24, 2014}}</ref> Past awards include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] Pioneer award (2015),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-announces-2015-pioneer-award-winners-caspar-bowden-citizen-lab-anriette|title=EFF Announces 2015 Pioneer Award Winners: Caspar Bowden, Citizen Lab, Anriette Esterhuysen and the Association for Progressive Communications, and Kathy Sierra|last=Release|first=Press|date=August 26, 2015|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|language=en|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> the [[Canadian Library Association]]'s Advancement of Intellectual Freedom in Canada Award (2013),<ref>{{cite web | title = The Citizen Lab wins the 2013 CLA Advancement of Intellectual Freedom in Canada Award | url = http://www.cla.ca/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=13924 | date = February 6, 2013 | access-date = March 24, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325044034/http://www.cla.ca/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&TEMPLATE=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=13924 | archive-date = March 25, 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref> the Canadian Committee for World Press Freedom's Press Freedom Award (2011),<ref>{{cite web | title = Citizen Lab Wins the 2011 Canadian Committee for World Press Freedom's Press Freedom Award | url = https://citizenlab.ca/2011/05/citizen-lab-wins-2011-press-freedom-award-of-the-canadian-committee-for-world-press-freedom/ | date = May 3, 2011 | access-date = March 24, 2014}}</ref> and the [[Canadian Journalists for Free Expression]]’s Vox Libera Award (2010).<ref>{{cite web | title = Canadian Internet Pioneer, The Citizen Lab, Wins Canadian Journalists for Free Expression Vox Libera award | url = https://citizenlab.ca/2010/11/canadian-internet-pioneer-the-citizen-lab-wins-canadian-journalists-for-free-expression-vox-libera-award/ | date = November 15, 2010 | access-date = March 24, 2014}}</ref>

The OpenNet Initiative has tested for Internet filtering in 74 countries and found that 42 of them—including both authoritarian and democratic regimes—implement some level of filtering.<ref>{{cite web | title = OpenNet Initiative | url = https://opennet.net/ | access-date = March 24, 2014}}</ref>

The Citizen Lab continued this research area through the Internet Censorship Lab (ICLab), a project aimed at developing new systems and methods for measuring Internet censorship. It was a collaborative effort between the Citizen Lab, Professor Phillipa Gill's group at [[Stony Brook University]]'s Department of Computer Science, and Professor Nick Feamster's Network Operations and Internet Security Group at [[Princeton University]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Internet Censorship Lab | url =  http://www.iclab.org/ | access-date = April 20, 2015}}</ref>

=== Application-level information controls ===
The Citizen Lab studies censorship and surveillance implemented in popular [[Application software|applications]] including social networks, instant messaging, and [[search engine]]s.

Previous work includes investigations of [[censorship|censorship practices]] of search engines provided by [[Google Search|Google]], [[Bing (search engine)|Microsoft]], and [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]] for the Chinese market along with the domestic Chinese search engine [[Baidu]]. In 2008, Nart Villeneuve found that [[TOM-Skype]] (the Chinese version of [[Skype]] at the time) had collected and stored millions of chat records on a publicly accessible server based in [[China]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Breaching Trust: An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China's TOM-Skype platform | year = 2008 | url =  https://www.scribd.com/doc/13712715/Breaching-Trust-An-analysis-of-surveillance-and-security-practices-on-Chinas-TOMSkype-platform}}</ref> In 2013, Citizen Lab researchers collaborated with Professor Jedidiah Crandall and Ph.D. student Jeffrey Knockel at the [[University of New Mexico]] to reverse engineering of TOM-Skype and [[Sina UC]], another instant messaging application used in China. The team was able to obtain the URLs and encryption keys for various versions of these two programs and downloaded the keyword blacklists daily. This work analyzed over one year and a half of data from tracking the keyword lists, examined the social and political contexts behind the content of these lists, and analyzed those times when the list had been updated, including correlations with current events.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chat program censorship and surveillance in China: Tracking TOM-Skype and Sina UC | url = http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4628/3727 | date = July 2013}}</ref>

Current research focuses on monitoring information controls on the popular Chinese [[microblogging]] service [[Sina Weibo]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Keyword: Bo Xilai | url = https://citizenlab.ca/bo_xilai/ | access-date = March 24, 2014}}; {{cite web | title = Visualizing Changes in Censorship: Summarizing two months of Sina Weibo keyword monitoring with two interactive charts | date = August 21, 2013 | url = https://citizenlab.ca/2013/08/visualizing-changes-in-censorship-summarizing-two-months-of-sina-weibo-keyword-monitoring-with-two-interactive-charts/}}</ref> Chinese online encyclopedias,<ref>{{cite web | title = Who's the Boss?

Analysis of a popular cellphone app called "[[Smart Sheriff]]", by Citizen Lab and the German group [[Cure53]], asserted the app represented a security hole that betrayed the privacy of the children it was meant to protect and that of their parents.<ref name=Csm2015-11-02/>
[[South Korea]]n law required all cellphones sold to those under 18 to contain software designed to protect children, and Smart Sheriff was the most popular government approved app—with 380,000 subscribers. The Citizen Lab/Cure53 report described Smart Sheriff's security holes as ''"catastrophic"''.<ref name=TorStar2015-11-02/>

=== Commercial surveillance ===
The Citizen Lab conducts groundbreaking research on the global proliferation of [[targeted surveillance]] software and toolkits, including [[FinFisher]], [[Hacking Team]] and [[NSO Group]].

FinFisher is a suite of remote intrusion and surveillance software developed by [[Munich]]-based Gamma International GmbH and marketed and sold exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies by the UK-based Gamma Group. In 2012, [[Morgan Marquis-Boire]] and Bill Marczak provided the first public identification of FinFisher's software. The Citizen Lab and collaborators have done extensive investigations into FinFisher, including revealing its use against Bahraini activists,<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Marquis-Boire | first1 = Morgan | last2 = Marczak | first2 = Bill | title = From Bahrain With Love: FinFisher's Spykit Exposed? | url = https://citizenlab.ca/2012/07/from-bahrain-with-love-finfishers-spy-kit-expose | date = July 25, 2012}}</ref> analyzing variants of the FinFisher suite that target mobile phone operating systems,<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Marquis-Boire | first1 = Morgan | last2 = Marczak | first2 = Bill | last3 = Gaurnieri | first3 = Claudio | title = The Smartphone Who Loved Me?

In 2018, the Citizen Lab released an investigation into the global proliferation of Internet filtering systems manufactured by the Canadian company, Netsweeper, Inc. Using a combination of publicly available IP scanning, network measurement data, and other technical tests, they identified Netsweeper installations designed to filter Internet content operational on networks in 30 countries and focused on 10 with past histories of human rights challenges: Afghanistan, Bahrain, India, Kuwait, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia, Sudan, UAE, and Yemen. Websites blocked in these countries include religious content, political campaigns, and media websites. Of particular interest was Netsweeper's ‘Alternative Lifestyles’ category, which appears to have as one of its principal purposes the blocking of non-pornographic LGBTQ content, including that offered by civil rights and advocacy organizations, HIV/AIDS prevention organizations, and LGBTQ media and cultural groups. The Citizen Lab called on government agencies to abandon the act of filtering LGBT content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2018/07/citizen-lab-open-letter-equal-rights-coalition/|title=Citizen Lab Open Letter in Advance of the Equal Rights Coalition Global Conference (August 5–7, 2018, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada)|date=July 31, 2018|website=The Citizen Lab|language=en-US|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref>

In 2017, the group released several reports that showcased phishing attempts in Mexico that used NSO Group technology. The products were used in multiple attempts to gain control of mobile devices of Mexican government officials, journalists, lawyers, human rights advocates and anti-corruption workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/tag/reckless/|title=Collection of reports on phishing attempts using NSO technology in the United Arab Emirates and Mexico}}</ref> The operations used SMS messages as bait in an attempt to trick targets into clicking on links to the NSO Group's exploit infrastructure. Clicking on the links would lead to the remote infection of a target's phone. In one case, the son of one of the journalists—a minor at the time—was also targeted. NSO, who purports to only sell products to governments, also came under the group's focus when prominent UAE human rights defender [[Ahmed Mansoor]]'s mobile phone was targeted. The report on these attempts showed the first time iOS zero day exploits in the wild and prompted Apple to release a security update to their iOS 9.3.5, affecting more than 1 billion Apple users worldwide.

In 2020, the Citizen Lab released a report unveiling [[Dark Basin]], a hack-for-hire group based in [[India]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=2021-06-09 |title=Toronto’s Citizen Lab uncovers massive hackers-for-hire organization ‘Dark Basin’ that has targeted hundreds of institutions on six continents |language=en |work=Financial Post |url=https://financialpost.com/financial-times/torontos-citizen-lab-uncovers-massive-hackers-for-hire-organization-dark-basin-that-has-targeted-hundreds-of-institutions-on-six-continents |access-date=2021-02-28}}</ref>

The Citizen Lab's research on commercial surveillance technologies has resulted in legal and policy impacts. In December 2013, the [[Wassenaar Arrangement]] was amended to include two new categories of surveillance systems on its Dual Use control list—"intrusion software" and "IP Network surveillance systems".<ref>{{cite web | title = International agreement reached controlling export of mass and intrusive surveillance technology | url = https://www.privacyinternational.org/blog/international-agreement-reached-controlling-export-of-mass-and-intrusive-surveillance | publisher = Privacy International | date = December 9, 2013 | access-date = March 25, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325173548/https://www.privacyinternational.org/blog/international-agreement-reached-controlling-export-of-mass-and-intrusive-surveillance | archive-date = March 25, 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The Wassenaar Arrangement seeks to limit the export of conventional arms and dual-use technologies by calling on signatories to exchange information and provide notification on export activities of goods and munitions included in its control lists. The amendments in December 2013 were the product of intense lobbying by civil society organizations and politicians in Europe, whose efforts were informed by Citizen Lab's research on intrusion software like FinFisher and surveillance systems developed and marketed by [[Blue Coat Systems]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Shedding Light on the Surveillance Industry: The importance of evidence-based, impartial research | url = https://citizenlab.ca/2013/12/shedding-light-on-the-surveillance-industry/ | date = December 20, 2013}}</ref>

=== Commercial filtering ===
The Citizen Lab studies the commercial market for censorship and surveillance technologies, which consists of a range of products that are capable of content filtering as well as passive surveillance.

The Citizen Lab has been developing and refining methods for performing Internet-wide scans to measure Internet filtering and detect externally visible installations of URL filtering products. The goal of this work is to develop simple, repeatable methodologies for identifying instances of internet filtering and installations of devices used to conduct censorship and surveillance.

The Citizen Lab has conducted research into companies such as Blue Coat Systems, Netsweeper, and [[Secure Computing|SmartFilter]]. Major reports include "Some Devices Wander by Mistake: Planet Blue Coat Redux" (2013),<ref>{{cite web | first1 = Morgan | last1 = Marquis-Boire | first2 = Collin | last2 = Anderson | first3 = Jakub | last3 = Dalek | first4 = Sarah | last4 = McKune | first5 = John | last5 = Scott-Railton | title = Some Devices Wander By Mistake: Planet Blue Coat Redux | url = https://citizenlab.ca/2013/07/planet-blue-coat-redux/ | date = July 9, 2013}}</ref> "O Pakistan, We Stand on Guard for Thee: An Analysis of Canada-based Netsweeper’s Role in Pakistan’s Censorship Regime" (2013),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2013/06/o-pakistan/|title=O Pakistan, We Stand on Guard for Thee: An Analysis of Canada-based Netsweeper's Role in Pakistan's Censorship Regime|last=Jakub Dalek, Adam Senft, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, and Ron Deibert|date=June 20, 2013}}</ref> and Planet Blue Coat: Mapping Global Censorship and Surveillance Tools (2013).<ref>{{cite web | first1 = Morgan | last1 = Marquis-Boire | first2 = Jakub | last2 = Dalek | first3 = Sarah | last3 = McKune | title = Planet Blue Coat: Mapping Global Censorship and Surveillance Tools | url = https://citizenlab.ca/2013/01/planet-blue-coat-mapping-global-censorship-and-surveillance-tools/ | date = January 15, 2013}}</ref>

Following the 2011 publication of "Behind Blue Coat: Investigations of Commercial Filtering in Syria and Burma", Blue Coat Systems officially announced that it would no longer provide "support, updates. or other services" to software in Syria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2011/11/behind-blue-coat/|title=Behind Blue Coat: Investigations of commercial filtering in Syria and Burma|last=Jakub Dalek and Adam Senft|date=November 9, 2011}}</ref> In December 2011, the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]'s [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] reacted to the Blue Coat evidence and imposed a $2.8 million fine on the Emirati company responsible for purchasing filtering products from Blue Coat and exporting them to Syria without a license.

Citizen Lab's Netsweeper research has been cited by [[Pakistan]]i civil society organizations Bytes for All and [[Bolo Bhi]] in public interest litigation against the Pakistani government and in formal complaints to the High Commission (Embassy) of Canada to Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web | title = Letter to High Commissioner Of Canada : Call for Transparency, Accountability & Action Following Reports On Netsweeper's Presence in Pakistan | publisher = Bolo Bhi | date = July 23, 2013 | url = http://bolobhi.org/canada-government-letter-netsweeper-pakistan/}}</ref>

=== Corporate Transparency and Government Accountability ===
The Citizen Lab examines transparency and accountability mechanisms relevant to the relationship between corporations and state agencies regarding personal data and other surveillance activities. This research has investigated the use of Artificial Intelligence in Canada's immigration and refugee systems (co-authored by the International Human Rights Program at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Law),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/bots-at-the-gate-human-rights-analysis-automated-decision-making-in-canadas-immigration-refugee-system/|title=Bots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision Making in Canada's Immigration and Refugee System|date=September 26, 2018|website=The Citizen Lab|language=en-US|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> an analysis of ongoing encryption debates in the Canadian context (co-authored by the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2018/05/shining-light-on-encryption-debate-canadian-field-guide/|title=Shining a Light on the Encryption Debate: A Canadian Field Guide|date=May 14, 2018|website=The Citizen Lab|language=en-US|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> and a close look at consumer personal data requests in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2018/02/approaching-access-look-consumer-personal-data-requests-canada/|title=Approaching Access: A look at consumer personal data requests in Canada|date=February 12, 2018|website=The Citizen Lab|language=en-US|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref>

In the summer of 2017, the Government of Canada introduced new national security legislation, Bill C-59 (the National Security Act). It proposed to significantly change Canada's national security agencies and practices, including Canada's signals intelligence agency (the Communications Security Establishment). Since the Bill was first proposed, a range of civil society groups and academics have called for significant amendments to the proposed Act. A co-authored paper by the Citizen Lab and the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic represented the most detailed and comprehensive analysis of CSE-related reforms to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2017/12/citizen-lab-and-cippic-release-analysis-of-the-communications-security-establishment-act/|title=Citizen Lab and CIPPIC Release Analysis of the Communications Security Establishment Act|date=December 18, 2017|website=The Citizen Lab|language=en-US|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> This analysis was produced to help members of parliament, journalists, researchers, lawyers, and civil society advocates engage more effectively on these issues and was included in parliamentary committee debates and highlighted in dozens of media reports.

== Policy engagement ==
The Citizen Lab is an active participant in various global discussions on Internet governance, such as the [[Internet Governance Forum]], [[ICANN]], and the United Nations Government Group of Experts on Information and Telecommunications.

Since 2010, the Citizen Lab has helped organize the annual Cyber Dialogue conference, hosted by the Munk School of Global Affairs’ Canada Centre, which convenes over 100 individuals from countries around the world who work in government, civil society, academia, and private enterprise in an effort to better understand the most pressing issues in cyberspace.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cyber Dialogue | url = http://www.cyberdialogue.ca/ | access-date = March 25, 2014}}</ref> The Cyber Dialogue has a participatory format that engages all attendees in a moderated dialogue on Internet security, governance, and human rights. Other conferences around the world, including a high-level meeting by the Hague-based [[Scientific Council for Government Policy]] and the Swedish government's [[Stockholm Internet Forum]], have taken up themes inspired by discussions at the Cyber Dialogue.

== Field building ==
The Citizen Lab contributes to [[capacity building|field building]] by supporting networks of researchers, advocates, and practitioners around the world, particularly from the [[North–South divide in the World|Global South]]. The Citizen Lab has developed regional networks of activists and researchers working on information controls and human rights for the past ten years. These networks are in Asia (OpenNet Asia), the Commonwealth of Independent States (OpenNet Eurasia), and the Middle East and North Africa.<ref>{{cite web | title = ONI Asia | url = http://www.oni-asia.net/ | access-date = March 25, 2014 | archive-date = September 23, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170923235133/http://www.oni-asia.net/ | url-status = dead }}</ref>

With the support of the [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC), the Citizen Lab launched the [https://cyberstewards.org/ Cyber Stewards Network] in 2012, which consists of South-based researchers, advocates, and practitioners who analyze and impact [[cybersecurity]] policies and practices at the local, regional, and international level. The project consists of 24 partners from across Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa<ref>{{cite web | title = Cyber Stewards Network | url =  http://cyberstewards.org/ | access-date = March 25, 2014}}</ref> including [[7iber]], [[OpenNet (organization)|OpenNet]], and the [[Centre for Internet and Society (India)|Centre for Internet and Society]].

Citizen Lab staff also work with local partners to educate and train at-risk communities. For example, in 2013 it collaborated with the [[Tibet Action Institute]] to hold public awareness events in [[Dharamshala]], [[India]], for the [[Tibetan diaspora|exiled Tibetan]] community on cyber espionage campaigns.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tibet Action Institute: Safe Travels Online Tech Meet | date = June 12, 2013 | url = https://cyberstewards.org/2013/06/public-awareness-program-on-internet-security-and-a-talk-on-targeted-threats-against-the-tibetan-community/ | access-date = March 25, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325174023/https://cyberstewards.org/2013/06/public-awareness-program-on-internet-security-and-a-talk-on-targeted-threats-against-the-tibetan-community/ | archive-date = March 25, 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref> In the winter of 2013, the Citizen Lab conducted a digital security training session for Russian investigative journalists at the Sakharov Center in [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Дискуссия "Современные угрозы информационной безопасности для НКО, активистов и журналистов" | publisher = Sakharov Center | date = December 17, 2013 | url = http://www.sakharov-center.ru/discussions/?id=2402}}</ref>

== In the media ==
The Citizen Lab's work is often cited in media stories relating to digital security, privacy controls, government policy, human rights, and technology. Since 2006, they have been featured on 24 front-page stories at publications including The New York Times, Washington Post, Globe and Mail and International Herald Tribune.

== Citizen Lab Summer Institute ==
Since 2013, Citizen Lab has hosted the [https://citizenlab.ca/summerinstitute/ Summer Institute on Monitoring Internet Openness and Rights] as an annual research workshop at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto. It brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, civil society, and the private sector who are working on Internet openness, security, and rights. Collaborations formed at CLSI workshops have led to publication of high impact reports on Internet filtering in Zambia,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ooni.torproject.org/post/zambia-election-monitoring/|title=Zambia: Internet censorship during the 2016 general elections?}}</ref> a security audit of child monitoring apps in South Korea,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2015/09/digital-risks-south-korea-smart-sheriff/|title=Are the Kids Alright?|last=Collin Anderson, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Chris Dehghanpoor, Ron Deibert, Sarah McKune, Davi Ottenheimer, and John Scott-Railton|date=September 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2017/09/safer-without-korean-child-monitoring-filtering-apps/|title=Safer Without: Korean Child Monitoring and Filtering Apps|last=Fabian Faessler, Geoffrey Alexander, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Andrew Hilts, and Kelly Kim|date=September 11, 2017}}</ref> and an analysis of the "Great Cannon",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/|title=China's Great Cannon|last=Bill Marczak, Nicholas Weaver, Jakub Dalek, Roya Ensafi, David Fifield, Sarah McKune, Arn Rey, John Scott-Railton, Ron Deibert, and Vern Paxson|date=April 10, 2015}}</ref> an attack tool in China used for large scale distributed-denial of service attacks against GitHub and GreatFire.org.

Citizen Lab October report revealed that NSO's "signature spy software" which had been placed on the iPhone of Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, one of Khashoggi's confidantes, months before.
