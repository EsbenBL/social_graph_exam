'''Alfred Haskell Conrad''' (January 2, 1924 â€“ October 18, 1970)<ref name=NYTobit>{{Citation| title = Dr. Alfred H. Conrad, City College Professor, Dies | newspaper = The New York Times | publication-place = New York, New York| date = October 20, 1970| url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/10/20/78818847.pdf}}</ref> was a distinguished professor of [[economics]] at [[Harvard University]] and [[City College of New York]]. He belonged to the quantitative economic current called [[new economic history]], or cliometrics.

Conrad attended Brooklyn Boys High and in 1947 graduated from Harvard College. There he completed a doctorate in economics in 1954 and later taught in the economics department and in the business school.

In 1958 he co-authored "The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South", in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', with [[John R. Meyer]]. Using rigorous statistics, the authors concluded that the view that slavery would have disappeared without the [[American Civil War]] was "a romantic hypothesis which will not stand against the facts". This study anticipated ''[[Time on the Cross]]'' by [[Robert Fogel]] and [[Stanley Engerman]], which reached the same conclusion.<ref name="Glaeser">[[Edward L.

Conrad was married to the poet [[Adrienne Rich]], with whom he had three sons. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in [[Peacham, Vermont]] at the age of 46.<ref name=NYTobit/>
