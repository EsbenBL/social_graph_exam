'''David LeFevre Dodd''' (August 23, 1895 – September 18, 1988) was an American educator, financial analyst, author, economist, and investor. In his student years, Dodd was a ''{{linktext|protégé}}'' and colleague of [[Benjamin Graham]] at [[Columbia Business School]].

The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] (Black Tuesday) almost wiped out Graham, who had started teaching the year before at his [[alma mater]], Columbia. The [[Stock market crash|crash]] inspired Graham to search for a more conservative, safer way to invest. Graham agreed to teach with the stipulation that someone take notes. Dodd, then a young instructor at Columbia, volunteered. Those transcriptions served as the basis for a 1934 book ''[[Security Analysis (book)|Security Analysis]]'', which galvanized the concept of [[value investing]]. It is the longest running investment text ever published.<ref>[[Janet Lowe|Janet Celesta Lowe]], ''Value Investing Made Easy,'' [[McGraw-Hill]] (1996)</ref>

==Early life and education==
In 1916, Dodd graduated from High Street School, a high school in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], where his father was the principal. In 1920, he completed his [[Bachelor of Science]], at [[University of Pennsylvania]]. One year later, he received his [[Master of Science]] at [[Columbia University]].<ref name="Obituary">{{cite news|title=David Dodd, 93, Dies; Professor of Business|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/20/obituaries/david-dodd-93-dies-professor-of-business.html|accessdate=30 January 2018|publisher=NY Times|date=September 20, 1988}}</ref>

==Academic life==
From 1922 to 1925, Dodd was an instructor of economics at [[Columbia University]]. From 1925 to 1930, he became an instructor of finance. From 1926 to 1945, he was in charge of the business and economics courses. In 1930, he received his [[PhD]] from Columbia University. From 1930 to 1938, Dodd was an assistant professor there, from 1938 to 1947 an associate professor, and from 1947 to 1961 a full professor. From 1948 to 1952, he was associate dean at the [[Columbia Business School]]. In 1961, he retired as [[professor emeritus]] in finance at Columbia University. On May 17, 1984, on the 50th anniversary of publishing ''[[Security Analysis (book)|Security Analysis]],'' [[Michael I. Sovern]], president of [[Columbia University]], awarded Dodd a [[Doctor of Letters]], an honorary degree, for applying financial theories with brilliant results in a highly competitive world of investments. Columbia President [[Michael Sovern]] bestowed the honor during Columbia's 230th [[Graduation|commencement]] exercises.

Dodd was a member of the following organizations: [[American Economic Association]], [[Social Science Research Council]] (investment committee 1950–1956), [[American Finance Association]] (vice president 1946–1947), [[New York Society of Security Analysts]], [[Beta Gamma Sigma]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Kappa Psi]], and [[Phi Chi Theta]].

At the time of his death, various editions of the book he coauthored, ''Security Analysis,'' had sold over 250,000 copies.<ref name="Obituary"/>

==Professional life==
From 1917 to 1919, he was in the [[US Navy]] during [[World War I]]; rising from [[boatswain]] to [[lieutenant]]. From 1921 to 1922, he was research assistant for an economist at National Bank of Commerce, New York (now part of [[JPMorgan Chase]] Bank, [[National Bank|National Association]]; see [https://web.archive.org/web/20080331071403/http://www.banking.state.ny.us/histw.txt NYS banking history here]). In 1928, he advised private clients on investments. From 1950 to 1958, he was Limited partner, Newman & Graham Ltd. (an unregulated [[hedge fund]]). From 1958 to 1959, he was general partner, Graham-Newman & Co. (a regulated [[investment trust]] formed in 1929).

===Value investing===
The phrases "Graham and Dodd," "[[value investing]]," "[[Margin of safety (financial)|margin of safety]]," and "[[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]]"—all biblical to value investors—are often used interchangeably when referring to an approach to investing. Despite the onset of [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) in the late 1950s—a theory that peaked throughout the 80s, gaining [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] recognition in 1990 (co-laureates: [[Harry Markowitz]], [[Merton Miller]], [[William F. Sharpe]])—Value Investing proved to be a formidable style that sharply defied [[Modern portfolio theory|MPT]]. The [[University of Chicago]] was at the center of MPT (see "[[quantitative analyst]]") while [[Columbia Business School|Columbia]] has been the [[Mecca]] for Value Investing for {{frac|7|1|2}} decades. 

Value Investors see securities as either priced correctly, under-priced, or over-priced. In contrast, MPT proponents insist that, by definition under the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], a realized price of a stock is the correct price. Value investor purists reject the usefulness of [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM), in part, because it wrongly [[extrapolate]]s historical volatility as a [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] for [[risk]]. For example, if equity prices of a company fell 75%, assuming the underlying fundamentals of the company were solid, an MPT practitioner would view it as volatile (risky); whereas, a value investor would determine whether it was undervalued, and if so, buy it, reasoning that the resulting downward risk is less than before. Therefore, value investors see MPT metrics—such as [[standard deviation]], [[Beta coefficient|beta]] (relative standard deviation), [[Alpha (finance)|alpha]] (excess return), and the [[Sharpe ratio]] (risk adjusted return)—as inadequate and even misleading.

Columbia resisted de-emphasizing Value Investing during the throes of the MPT renaissance, but the appeal of MPT seemed to be part of a larger movement, thrusting finance aspects of business education into higher echelons of academia. During about a 25-year period (1965–90), published research and articles in leading journals of the value ilk were few. [[Warren Buffett]] once commented, "You couldn't advance in a finance department in this country unless you taught that the world was flat."<ref>Joseph Nocera, ''The Heresy That Made Them Rich,'' [[The New York Times]], October 29, 2005</ref> Shortly after the death of David Dodd in 1988, [[Bruce Greenwald]], a star professor at [[Columbia Business School|CBS]], took a keen interest in Value Investing. He found the overwhelming success of Value investors difficult to dismiss. At the same time, reliable data that fortified Value Investing was solidifying, while MPT was showing some flaws. Professor Greenwald invigorated the academic aspects of what many in [[ivory tower]]s erstwhile treated as a vocational discipline.

MPT pundits argue that the Warren Buffett's long-term record is a [[statistics|statistical]] three- to [[Fat tail|five-sigma event]]—that is, his success is probable, but not replicable with certainty.<ref>Buffett Partnership, Ltd., a limited investment partnership Buffett managed from 1957 to 1969, beat the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] every year of its existence, achieving a cumulative return of 2,749.9% relative to the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|DJIA]]'s 152.6%. [[Berkshire Hathaway|Berkshire Hathaway Inc]]., a onetime beleaguered textile company that Buffett acquired in 1965 and transformed into an investment vehicle, beat the pre-tax total return of the [[S&P 500]] in 36 of 41 years, achieving an after-tax cumulative return of 305,134% relative to the [[S&P 500]]'s pre-tax total return (with reinvested [[dividends]]) of 5,583%. [[Nobel Laureate]] [[William F. Sharpe]] dismissed Buffett's success as a three sigma event—a statistical aberration absurdly out of line.</ref>

Yet the success of numerous other investment funds and practitioners who applied [[value investing]] theories weakened assertions attributing success to [[probability|chance]]. Because Value Investing rejects MPT and its use of sophisticated [[statistics]], there's irony when MPT theorists attribute its success to [[standard deviation|tails]] of [[standard deviation]]. [[Bruce Greenwald]] overhauled and relaunched the Value Investing curriculum at Columbia in the spring of 1994. Today, Value Investing enjoys broad appeal among academicians and investors around the world. Professor Greenwald is the Robert Heilbrunn Professor of Finance and [[Asset Management]] at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia Business School|Graduate School of Business]].
