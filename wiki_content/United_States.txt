[[Paleo-Indians]] [[Settlement of the Americas|migrated from Siberia]] to the North American mainland at least [[Timeline of human prehistory|12,000 years ago]], and [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] established along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Disputes with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] over [[History of taxation in the United States|taxation]] and [[No taxation without representation|political representation]] led to the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), which established the nation's [[independence]]. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually [[Territorial evolution of the United States|obtaining new territories]], sometimes [[Mexican–American War|through war]], frequently [[Indian removal|displacing Native Americans]], and [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|admitting new states]]; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. [[Slavery in the United States|Slavery]] was legal in the [[Slave states and free states|southern United States]] until the second half of the 19th century, when the [[American Civil War]] led to [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|its abolition]]. The [[Spanish–American War]] and {{nowrap|[[World War I]]}} established the U.S. as a [[Great Power|world power]], a status confirmed by the outcome of {{nowrap|[[World War II]]}}. During the [[Cold War]], the United States fought the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]] but avoided direct military conflict with the [[Soviet Union]]. The two superpowers competed in the [[Space Race]], culminating in the [[Apollo 11|1969 spaceflight]] that first landed humans on the Moon. The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991]] ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole [[superpower]].

The United States is a [[federal republic]] and a [[representative democracy]] with [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|three separate branches of government]], including a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]]. It is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Organization of American States]], [[NATO]], and other international organizations. It is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Considered a [[melting pot]] of [[Culture of the United States|cultures]] and [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|ethnicities]], its population has been profoundly shaped by [[History of immigration to the United States|centuries of immigration]]. The U.S. [[International rankings of the United States|ranks high]] in international measures of [[List of countries by economic freedom|economic freedom]], [[Human Development Index|quality of life]], [[Education Index|education]], and [[Human rights in the United States|human rights]]; it has low levels of [[Corruption Perceptions Index|perceived corruption]]. However, the country has been criticized for [[Inequality in the United States (disambiguation)|inequality]]<!--intentional link to DAB page--> related to [[Racial inequality in the United States|race]], [[Wealth inequality in the United States|wealth]], and [[Income inequality in the United States|income]]; use of [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]]; high [[Incarceration in the United States|incarceration rates]]; and lack of [[Health care in the United States|universal health care]].

The first known use of the name "[[Americas|America]]" dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world map produced by the German cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller]].

The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms are the "U.S.", the "USA", and "America". [[Colloquial]] names are the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States". "[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]", a name popular in [[American poetry]] and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from [[Christopher Columbus]]; both "Columbus" and "Columbia" appear frequently in U.S. place-names, including [[Columbus, Ohio]], [[Columbia, South Carolina]], and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Places and institutions throughout the Western Hemisphere bear the two names, including [[Colón, Panama]], the country of [[Colombia]], the [[Columbia River]], and [[Columbia University]].

The phrase "United States" was originally plural in American usage. It described a collection of states—e.g., "the United States are." The singular form became popular after the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and is now standard usage in the U.S. A [[Citizenship of the United States|citizen of the United States]] is an "[[Americans|American]]". "United States", "American" and "U.S." refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S.&nbsp;forces"). In English, the word "[[American (word)|American]]" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth G. |title=The Columbia guide to standard American English |url=https://archive.org/details/columbiaguidetos00wils_0 |url-access=registration |date=1993 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-06989-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/columbiaguidetos00wils_0/page/27 27–28]}}</ref>

It has been generally accepted that the [[Settlement of the Americas|first inhabitants of North America]] migrated from [[Siberia]] by way of the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.{{sfn|Erlandson|Rick|Vellanoweth|2008|p=19}}{{sfn|Savage|2011|page= 55}}{{sfn|Haviland|Walrath|Prins|2013|page=219}} The [[Clovis culture]], which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas.{{sfn|Waters|Stafford|2007|pages=1122–1126}}{{sfn|Flannery|2015|pages=173–185}} This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos.{{sfn|Gelo|2018|pages=79–80}}

Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his [[Emancipation Proclamation]], the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which prohibited slavery except as [[Penal labor in the United States|penal labor]]. Two other amendments were also ratified, ensuring citizenship for blacks and, at least in theory, voting rights for them as well.

[[Reconstruction (United States)|Reconstruction]] began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] on {{nowrap|April 14, 1865}} drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the [[Compromise of 1877]] when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the [[1876 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1876]].

Southern white Democrats, calling themselves "[[Redeemers]]", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction, beginning the [[nadir of American race relations]]. From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called [[Jim Crow laws]], [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region.

The [[U.S. state|50 states]] are the principal political divisions in the country. Each state holds jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. They are subdivided into counties or county equivalents and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.<ref>{{usc|8|1101}}(a)(36) and {{usc|8|1101}}(a)(38) U.S. Federal Code, Immigration and Nationality Act. {{USC|8|1101a}}</ref> The states and the District of Columbia choose the president of the United States.

The United States also observes [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]] of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts.

The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing [[interchangeable parts]] were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a [[machine tool]] industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]]. Factory [[electrification]] in the early 20th century and introduction of the [[assembly line]] and other labor-saving techniques created the system of [[mass production]].<ref>{{Hounshell1984}}</ref> In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research and Development (R&D) Expenditures by Source and Objective: 1970 to 2004|url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2008/tables/08s0775.xls|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120210170338/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2008/tables/08s0775.xls|archive-date=February 10, 2012|access-date=June 19, 2007}}</ref> The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and [[impact factor]].<ref>{{cite news|author=MacLeod, Donald|date=March 21, 2006|title=Britain Second in World Research Rankings|work=The Guardian|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/mar/21/highereducation.uk4|access-date=May 14, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Understanding China's AI Strategy|url=https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/understanding-chinas-ai-strategy|last=Allen|first=Gregory|date=February 6, 2019|website=Center for a New American Security}}</ref>

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe, contributing to [[Western culture]]. Writers such as [[Washington Irving]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]] established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century.

The [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]], led by Thoreau and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], established the first major [[American philosophy|American philosophical movement]]. After the Civil War, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and then [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] were leaders in the development of [[pragmatism]].

[[Anthony Heinrich]] was the most prominent composer before the Civil War.

Although little known at the time, [[Charles Ives]]'s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as [[Henry Cowell]] and [[John Cage]] created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. [[Aaron Copland]] and [[George Gershwin]]—eventually furthered by [[Leonard Bernstein]]—developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.

In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public radio broadcasting is supplied by [[NPR]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/about-npr/192827079/overview-and-history|title=History: NPR|website=NPR.org|access-date=May 5, 2021}}</ref> NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]]; its television counterpart, [[PBS]], was created by the same legislation. {{As of|2014|09|30|df=US}}, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).<ref>{{cite web |last=Waits |first=Jennifer |title=Number of U.S. Radio Stations on the Rise, Especially LPFM, according to New FCC Count |website=Radio Survivor |date=October 17, 2014 |access-date=January 6, 2015 |url=http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2014/10/17/number-u-s-radio-stations-rise-especially-lpfm-according-latest-fcc-count/}}</ref>

Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as New York City's ''[[The Village Voice]]'' or Los Angeles' ''[[LA Weekly]]''. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.
