Stevens authored a milestone textbook, the 1400+ page ''Handbook of Experimental Psychology'' (1951). He was also one of the founding organizers of the [[Psychonomic Society]].  In 1946 he introduced a theory of [[level of measurement|levels of measurement]] widely used by scientists but whose use in some areas of [[statistics]] has been criticized.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Velleman |first1=Paul F. |first2=Leland |last2=Wilkinson |author-link2=Leland Wilkinson |title=Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio typologies are misleading |journal=The American Statistician |year=1993 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=65–72 |jstor=2684788 }}</ref> In addition, Stevens played a key role in the development of the use of [[operational definitions]] in psychology.<ref name = Nicholson/>

A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Stevens as the 52nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell III |first9=John L. |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913 |s2cid=145668721 }}</ref>

==Life==
Stevens was born in [[Ogden, Utah]] to Stanley and Adeline (Smith) Stevens and educated in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]]-affiliated schools in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. He spent much of his childhood in the [[polygamous]] household of his maternal grandfather Orson Smith. At the death of his parents in 1924, he spent the next 3 years on an LDS mission in [[Switzerland]] and [[Belgium]].  He attended the [[University of Utah]] from 1927 to 1929 and [[Stanford University]] for the next two years, graduating with an [[Bachelor of arts|A.B.]] in psychology in 1931.

Shortly after arriving in Massachusetts to begin a Ph.D., he left the LDS church.<ref name = Nicholson>{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|title=From the Book of Mormon to the Operational Definition: The Existential Project of S.S. Stevens|date=2005|isbn=9780198037606|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mc6KzuyEtDoC&q=%22orson+smith%22+mormon&pg=PA287|access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref> After two years of graduate study, he received his Ph.D. in psychology from [[Harvard University]], where he served under [[Edwin Boring]] as assistant in psychology, from 1932 to 1934.

The following year he spent studying physiology under [[Hallowell Davis]] at [[Harvard Medical School]], and in 1935 served as a research fellow in physics at Harvard for a year. In 1936, Stevens accepted a position as an instructor in experimental psychology at Harvard University.<ref name=AJS>{{cite journal |jstor=1422022 |title=Stanley Smith Stevens: 1906–1973 |journal=American Journal of Psychology |date=1974 |volume=87 |issue=1/2 |pages=279–288|last1=Miller |first1=George A. }}</ref>

He married Maxine Leonard in 1930 and had a son, Peter Smith Stevens, in 1936.<ref name=AJS/>

==Science of Science discussion group==
Stevens played a key role in organising the [[Science of Science discussion group]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which met on eight occasions from October 1940 to mid-1941. Stevens, who was noted for the clarity of his scientific writing, attracted to the group a number of participants whose aim was the "debabelisation of science". The group was also influenced by the 5th Congress of the Unity of Science, which had been held at [[Harvard University]] in September 1939 and featured a number of well-known scientists from different disciplines.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hardcastle|author-link1=Gary Hardcastle|editor1-last=Richardson|editor1-first=Alan W.|editor2-last=Hardcastle|editor2-first=Gary L.|article=Debabelizing Science: The Harvard Science of Science Discussion Group, 1940–41|title=Logical Empiricism in North America|date=2003|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|pages=170–196}}</ref>

==Work==
Stevens' experimental and theoretical work lay primarily in the fields of [[psychophysics]] and [[psychoacoustics]]. One of his most influential contributions was his definition of a measurement scale  defined by four types: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio. (see [[Level of measurement]]) <ref>[http://web.mit.edu/epl/StevensBiography.pdf], 2001, pp. 15105–15108</ref>
