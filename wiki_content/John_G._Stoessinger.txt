'''John George Stoessinger''' (October 14, 1927 - November 20, 2017),<ref>{{cite LAF|id=n 50010403}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCEiAQAAIAAJ Who's who in American Education] (1966).</ref> was an American author who wrote ten leading books on world [[politics]], including  ''The Might of Nations'', which received the distinguished [[Bancroft Prize]] for History. Stoessinger was also the Acting Director for the Political Affairs Division at the [[United Nations]]. 

==Life and career==
On the eve of [[World War II]], Stoessinger fled from [[Anschluss|Nazi Austria]] to [[Czechoslovakia]]. His family was saved by a Japanese diplomat, [[Chiune Sugihara]], who issued three [[Transit visa|visas to transit]] Russia, allowing them to escape to [[Shanghai]] via [[Siberia]] and [[Kobe]]. Stoessinger was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, lecturing extensively throughout the world, and served as Distinguished Professor of Global Diplomacy at the [[University of San Diego]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John George Stoessinger|url=http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=John-Stoessinger&lc=9560&pid=187318101&mid=7650215|publisher=Dignity Memorial|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref>

Stoessinger's work is notable for his individualistic analyses of war, contrasted with the systemic views more commonly studied by political scientists after the [[Second World War]]. An example of this is his work in ''Why Nations Go to War''. In that book's first chapter, "The Iron Dice," Stoessinger offers an alternative explanation of the causes of World War I, one that includes human reactions and feelings.
