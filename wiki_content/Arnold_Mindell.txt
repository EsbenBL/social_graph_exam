==Work==

===Overview===
Mindell founded and developed [[process oriented psychology]], also known as Process Work.  Core ideas include his ‘dreambody’ concept and the application of psychology to social issues and conflict resolution in large groups, known as ‘worldwork’ and the principle of ‘deep democracy.’<ref name=Totton2003 /><ref name=VanNuys2008 /><ref name=Prengle>{{cite web |last=Prengle |first=Serge |title=Arny Mindell (March, 2009) |url=http://somaticperspectives.com/2009/03/mindell/ |publisher=Somatic Perspectives on Psychotherapy |access-date=February 5, 2014}}</ref>
Mindell's first book, ''Dreambody: The Body's Role in Revealing the Self'' (1982), linked ‘the mind's dreaming process with illness and physical symptoms as well as with disciplines such as yoga and tai chi.’<ref name="Nees2015" />{{rp|17}} Mindell is known for suggesting that ‘symptoms are dreams trying to come true.’<ref name="Maisel">{{cite web |last1=Maisel |first1=Eric R. |title=Gregg Levoy on Meaningful Work (March 12, 2016) |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rethinking-mental-health/201603/gregg-levoy-meaningful-work |website=Psychology Today |access-date=April 10, 2016}}</ref>

[[Stanislav Grof]] has described Arnold Mindell as one of the ‘pioneers of transpersonal psychology.’<ref name=Grof2010>Grof, S. (2010). The Consciousness Revolution. In V. V. Kozlov, V. V.

In the 2017 critical exploration of the relationship between African Americans and C.G. Jung's analytical psychology, Fanny Brewster describes Mindell's dreambody work and his linking of body symptoms and psychological development.<ref name="Brewster2017">{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Fanny|title=African Americans and Jungian Psychology: Leaving the Shadows|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1138952768}}</ref>{{rp|59–61}} Brewster finds that Mindell's development of Jungian ideas are aligned with traditional African concepts of healing which link mind and body: 
: ‘I believe that Mindell's approach to dreamwork with its emphasis on body healing mirrors the African system of healing's inclusiveness of body and mind in the process.’<ref name="Brewster2017"/>{{rp|59}}

Mindell has been described as ‘a natural interculturalist who excels at building relationships across cultural boundaries.’<ref name="Nees2015" />{{rp|18}} Mindell's intercultural skills include a focus on the importance of nonverbal elements of communication and the ‘ability to switch viewpoints and join the other's reality.’<ref name="Nees2015" />{{rp|19–21}}

Mindell has been criticised for teaching [[New Age]] concepts and practices that are unclear and unknown within the mainstream of psychology; and it is noted that he is not licensed as a clinical psychologist in Oregon.<ref name="Schafer" />  Mindell's dreambody work has been criticized as a form of 'metaphysical healthcare';<ref name="Raso 1998">{{cite book |last=Raso |first=Jack |title=The Expanded Dictionary of Metaphysical Healthcare, Alternative Medicine, Paranormal Healing, and Related Methods |year=1998 |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/dictionary/md00.html}}</ref> while another commentator referred to process oriented psychology as an example of a transpersonal psychology with the potential, he claimed, to be misused as a form of 'mind control.'<ref>{{cite web |last=Tomabechi |first=Hideto |title=An interview: A brain-functionalist who deprogrammed AUM's top leaders A Devastating Scenario: A Mind Control Society |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/y.shimazu/epilogueDrT.html |work=Takarajima, No. 304, March 1997. Pp. 224-271 |access-date=December 30, 2013}}</ref>

===Key ideas===
The ‘dreambody’ concept was developed in the 1970s while Mindell was a practicing Jungian analyst, derived from his observation of connections between people's dreams and their body symptoms and published in ''Dreambody: the Body's Role in Revealing the Self'' (Routledge, 1982).<ref name=Singer1995 /><ref name=Schuit1996 /> Mindell's therapeutic technique has been compared to [[Fritz Perls]]: “The most striking difference, at least from Perls himself, is one of mood – Mindell's work is playful, supportive and permissive rather than confrontational.”<ref name=Totton2003 /> {{rp|28}} Another commentator writes: “Mindell … exemplifies both the good and bad of contemporary dreamwork. On the first score: there is a bit of flim-flam about Mindell. And he conspicuously overemploys the first person singular while extolling non-ego functions. Also, he interprets disease processes so positively that they begin to lose their catagogic authenticity. But on the second score: he is inventive, creative, intuitive, holistic, and affirmative. He breaks down prevailing categories and finds authentic meanings where our culture traditionally does not. And he helps people.”<ref name=Shafton1995 />{{rp|522}}

In 1995 Mindell extended the dreambody concept to a theory and practice of working with people in coma and near death states;<ref name=Singer1995 /><ref name=Schuit1996 /> this work inspired a UK theatre production by [[Improbable theatre]].<ref>Gardner, L. (May 4, 1999). Arts: Beautiful dreamers: It's hard to imagine a less promising subject for a play than a coma. But if anyone can make it work, it's Improbable Theatre. ''The Guardian'', p. News: p13. London</ref><ref>Taylor, P. (May 24, 1999). Theatre: In Death's other kingdom. ''The Independent''. London.</ref> In his 1988 book, ''City Shadows: Psychological Interventions in Psychiatry,'' Mindell presented his approach to psychiatric disorders, drug addiction and mental retardation.  The book provides verbatim case studies describing interventions focused on the meaning of the patient's unusual communication, including non-verbal signals.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ramon |first=S. |title=Book Reviews: City Shadows: Psychological Interventions in Psychiatry by Arnold Mindell |journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry |year=1989 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=210 |doi=10.1177/002076408903500212 |url=http://isp.sagepub.com/content/35/2/210.extrac |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140206080932/http://isp.sagepub.com/content/35/2/210.extrac |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-02-06 }}</ref>

Mindell's 1990 book, ''Working on Yourself Alone: Inner Dreambody Work,'' presents a meditation practice that focuses attention on subtle body experiences and amplifies them to reveal unexpected information and meaning for the meditator.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mastrangelo |first=L. |title=Dreams and the body: Ways of seeking ancestral knowledge – Part I |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner (CA) |date=May 8, 2009}}</ref> It provides a model for creative spiritual practice involving inner reflection and personal development.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mastrangelo |first=L. |title=The dream as spiritual practice: Redefining discipline |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner (CA) |date=May 4, 2009}}</ref> In the 2002 work, Dreaming while Awake: Techniques for 24-hour Lucid Dreaming, Mindell built on ideas of [[lucid dream]]ing, indigenous traditions and [[Zen Buddhism]] to create an awareness practice for daily life: paying attention to thoughts and perceptions that are normally dismissed, which he calls ‘flirts’ from the ‘Dreaming.’<ref name=Simpkinson2004>{{cite web |last=Simpkinson |first=Laurie |title=Dreaming While Awake Techniques for 24-Hour Lucid Dreaming by Arnold Mindell (Book review) |url=http://www.noetic.org/library/book-reviews/dreaming-while-awake/ |work=Shift Magazine, March 2004, p. 31–32 |publisher=IONS Library |access-date=February 6, 2014}}</ref>
