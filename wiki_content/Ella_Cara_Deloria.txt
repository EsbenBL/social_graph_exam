==Life==
Deloria was born in 1889 in the White Swan district of the [[Yankton Indian Reservation]], [[South Dakota]].<ref name=":0" /> Her parents were Mary (or Miriam) (Sully) Bordeaux Deloria and Philip Joseph Deloria,<ref name=":1" /> the family having Yankton Dakota, [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]] and German roots. (The family surname goes back to a French trapper ancestor named ''Francois-Xavier Delauriers''.)  Her father was one of the first Sioux to be ordained as an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] priest. Her mother was the daughter of [[Alfred Sully]], a general in the US Army, and a Métis Yankton Sioux.  Ella was the first child to the couple, who each had several daughters by previous marriages. Her full siblings were sister Susan (also known as [[Mary Sully]])<ref>{{Cite book|title=Becoming Mary Sully: Toward an American Indian Abstract|last=Deloria|first=Philip J.|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2019|isbn=9780295745046|pages=47}}</ref> and brother Vine Deloria Sr., who became an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest like their father. The noted writer [[Vine Deloria Jr.]] is her nephew.

Deloria was brought up among the Hunkpapaya and Sihasapa [[Lakota people]]<ref name=":4" /> on the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]], at [[Wakpala, South Dakota|Wakpala]], and was educated first at her father's [[mission school]], St. Elizabeth's Church and Boarding School and then at [[All Saints School (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|All Saints Boarding School]]<ref name="ogilvie2000">{{cite book | last1 = Ogilvie | first1 = Marilyn | last2 = Harvey | first2 = Joy | author-link = Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie | author2-link = Joy Harvey | title = The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-415-92038-4 | url = https://archive.org/details/biographicaldict00ogil_0 }}</ref> in [[Sioux Falls]].<ref name=":0" /> After graduation in 1910, she attended [[Oberlin College]], [[Ohio]], to which she had won a scholarship.  After three years at Oberlin, Deloria transferred to Columbia [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], [[New York City|New York]], and graduated with a [[B.Sc.]] and a special teaching certificate in 1915.<ref name=":1" /><ref>[http://web.a.ebscohost.com]</ref>

She went on to become
<blockquote>"one of the first truly bilingual, bicultural figures in American anthropology, and an extraordinary scholar, teacher, and spirit who pursued her own work and commitments under notoriously adverse conditions.  At one point she lived out of a car while collecting material for [[Franz Boas]]."<ref name="columbiafellowship">{{Cite web|title=Ella C. Deloria Undergraduate Research Fellowship|url=https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/fellowships-and-awards|access-date=2013-08-07|work=Department of Anthropology, Columbia University}}</ref>
</blockquote> 
Throughout her professional life, she suffered from not having the money or the free time necessary to take an advanced degree. She was committed to the support of her family. Her father and step-mother were elderly, and her sister Susan depended on her financially.<ref name=":5" />

In addition to her work in anthropology (see below), Deloria had a number of jobs, including teaching (dance and physical education at [[Haskell Indian Nations University|Haskell Indian Boarding School]]<ref name=":1" />), lecturing and giving demonstrations (on Native American culture), and working for the [[Camp Fire Girls]] and for the [[YWCA]] as a national health education secretary.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Native Speakers: Ella Deloria, Zora Neale Hurston, Jovita Gonzalez, and the Poetics of Culture|last=Cotera|first=Maria|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0292782488}}</ref> She also held positions at the [[Sioux Indian Museum]] in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], and as assistant director at the [[W.H. Over Museum]] in [[Vermillion, South Dakota|Vermillion]].

Deloria had a series of [[stroke]]s in 1970,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Indians|last2=Deloria|first2=Ella|date=1998|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|pages=xix|chapter=Introduction|last1=Deloria|first1=Vine}}</ref> dying the following year of [[pneumonia]].

==Work and achievements==
Deloria met [[Franz Boas]] while at Teachers College, and began a professional association with him that lasted until his death in 1942.<ref name=":2" /> Boas recruited her as a student, and engaged her to work with him on the linguistics of Native American languages.<ref name="Jan Ullrich 2008">Jan Ullrich, ''New Lakota Dictionary''. (2008, Lakota Language Consortium). {{ISBN|0-9761082-9-1}}. (includes a detailed chapter on Deloria's contribution to the study of the Lakota language)</ref> She also worked with [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], prominent anthropologists who had been graduate students of Boas. For her work on American Indian cultures, she had the advantage of fluency in the Dakota and [[Lakota language|Lakota]] dialects of [[Sioux language|Sioux]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zia.aisri.indiana.edu/deloria_archive/about.php?topic=ella|title=Ella Deloria Archive|website=American Indian Studies Research Institute, Indiana University}}</ref> in addition to [[English language|English]] and [[Latin language|Latin]].

Although Deloria worked under Boas, Mead, and Benedict, experts have primarily focused on the bridge she enacted between white and Native cultural perspectives, Deloria’s dual commitments to her work and family, and the importance of her expertise to Indigenous communities.<ref name="auto">Bonnie, Sarah L., and Susan H. Krook. 2018. “The Mentoring of Miss Deloria: Poetics, Politics, and the Test of Tradition.” American Indian Quarterly 42 (3): 281–305. doi:10.5250/amerindiquar.42.3.0281.</ref> Therefore, “exam[ining] Deloria’s reciprocal mentoring relationships, in this way intervening in previous scholarship’s emphasis upon Deloria’s cultural mediation and personal hardships to highlight her impact on the field of anthropology . . . was instrumental in bringing about important advances to the field.”<ref name="auto"/> This “reciprocal mentoring relationship” can be seen between Franz Boas and Ella Deloria. 

Deloria met Franz Boas while at Teachers College; “Boas was impressed enough with this young woman . . . that he asked her to teach Siouan dialects (she was proficient in Lakota and Nakota dialects and spoke Dakota at home as a child) to his students in a class he was teaching in linguistics."<ref name="auto"/> Moreover, it has been contended that “the mentoring role demands even more of the anthropologist . . . anthropology mentors must suspend the skills they have worked so hard to develop and instead engage in a more passive role for providing insight and eventual understanding."<ref name="auto"/> Deloria established her "own clear, dissenting voice and pushed her mentors to alter their assumptions."<ref name="auto"/> Due to personal family obligations, Deloria "[was] forced to return home to the Midwest in 1915, and “it was not until 1927 that Deloria was reintroduced to the academic world of anthropology . . . Boas visited Deloria in Kansas that summer and asked her to recommence her work on the Lakota language."<ref name="auto"/> However, the relationship between Deloria and Boas was complex and has been further revealed through letters. "James Walker amassed an enormous body of information regarding Lakota beliefs, rituals, and myths. Boas had asked Deloria to substantiate his findings . . . She became critical of Walker’s work when she discovered that he had failed to separate creative fiction from traditional stories. After Deloria shared her findings with Boas, he did not hesitate to express his dissatisfaction."<ref name="auto"/> He was trying to align these answers with information from earlier anthropologists (European American men) had provided.<ref name="auto"/> On the other hand, “[Franz]Boas encouraged Deloria to verify myths of the Lakota."<ref name="auto"/> Nevertheless, "Boas became and remained a charismatic mentor to Deloria, and through her voice of dissent, she challenged Boas to rise to a higher standard in his own work.”<ref name="auto"/>


Her linguistic abilities and her intimate knowledge of traditional and Christianized Sioux culture, together with her deep commitment both to American Indian cultures and to scholarship, allowed Deloria to carry out important, often ground-breaking work in anthropology and ethnology. She also translated into English several Sioux historical and scholarly texts, such as the Lakota texts of [[George Bushotter]] (1864-1892), the first Sioux ethnographer (Deloria 2006; originally published in 1932); and the [[Sioux|Santee]] texts recorded by Presbyterian missionaries Samuel and [[Gideon Pond]], brothers from Connecticut.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker, J.

In 1938–39, Deloria was one of a small group of researchers commissioned to do a socioeconomic study on the [[Navajo Reservation]] for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]];<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Hoefel|first=Roseanne|date=Spring 2001|title=Different by Degree: Ella Cara Deloria, Zora Neale Hurston, and Franz Boas Contend with Race and Ethnicity|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=25|issue=2|pages=181–202|jstor=1185948|doi=10.1353/aiq.2001.0023|s2cid=162255878}}</ref> it was funded by the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]. They published their report, entitled ''The Navajo Indian Problem''. This project opened the door for Deloria to receive more speaking engagements, as well as funding to support her continued important work on Native languages.

In 1940, she and her sister Susan went to [[Pembroke, North Carolina]] to conduct some research among the self-identified [[Lumbee]] of [[Robeson County, North Carolina|Robeson County]].<ref name=":3" /> The project was supported by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the federal [[Farm Security Administration]]. Since the late 19th century, these [[mixed-race]] people, considered [[free people of color]] before the Civil War, had been recognized as an Indian tribe by the state of North Carolina, which allowed them to have their own schools, rather than requiring them to send their children to schools with the children of [[freedmen]]. They were also seeking federal recognition as a Native American tribe.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-29|title=Convolutions of Race and Identity: The Lumbee Struggle for Sovereignty|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/convolutions-of-race-and-identity-the-lumbee-struggle-for-sovereignty/|access-date=2020-06-20|website=Non Profit News {{!}} Nonprofit Quarterly|language=en-US}}</ref> Deloria believed she could make an important contribution to their effort for recognition by studying their distinctive culture and what remained of their original language. In her study, she conducted interviews with a range of people in the group, including women, about their use of plants, food, medicine, and animal names. She came very close to completing a dictionary of what may have been their original language before they adopted English.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Introduction.
