Treisman researched visual [[attention]], object [[perception]], and [[memory]]. One of her most influential ideas is the [[Feature integration theory|feature integration theory of attention]], first published with Garry Gelade in 1980. Treisman taught at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of British Columbia]], [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Princeton University]]. Notable postdoctoral fellows she supervised included [[Nancy Kanwisher]] and [[Nilli Lavie]].

In 2013, Treisman received the [[National Medal of Science]] from President [[Barack Obama]] for her pioneering work in the study of attention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treisman wins National Medal of Science for psychology research |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S35/72/22Q97/index.xml?section=topstories |publisher=Princeton University |date=3 January 2013 |access-date=9 March 2013}}</ref> During her long career, Treisman experimentally and theoretically defined the issue of how information is selected and integrated to form meaningful objects that guide human thought and action.

== Early life and education ==
Anne Treisman was born in [[Wakefield]], [[Yorkshire]], England. Two years later, her family moved to a village near [[Rochester, Kent]]{{sfn|Sheehy|2016|p=580}}  where her father, Percy Taylor, worked as chief education officer during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|title=One on one...with Anne Treisman|url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=23&editionID=194&ArticleID=1755|publisher=the psychologist|date=9 October 2010|access-date=18 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620121833/http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=23&editionID=194&ArticleID=1755|archive-date=20 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Her mother, Suzanne Touren, was French.<ref name="obit nyt" /> At the age of 11, Treisman moved with her family to [[Reading, Berkshire]] where she attended the girls' grammar school [[Kendrick School]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/TheHistoryofNeuroscience/Volume-8/AnneTreisman.ashx?la=en&hash=EDED3E84883883094054A02B99D0C69F97071694 |title=Anne Treisman |publisher= sfn.org |date=16 April 2014 |access-date=12 February 2018}}</ref> The English educational system at the time forced Treisman to choose only three subjects in her last two years at secondary school, and Treisman focused on the language arts (French, Latin and History).

Treisman received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in French Literature at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] in 1954. She received a first class BA with distinction, which earned her a scholarship that she used to obtain a second BA in psychology. During this extra year, Treisman studied under the supervision of [[Richard Gregory]], who introduced her to various methods of exploring the mind through experiments in perception.<ref name="History of Research on Attention">[[Wikibooks:Applied History of Psychology/History of Research on Attention]]</ref> While at Cambridge, she was active in the [[folk music]] scene.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|title=Folk story|journal=Cam|year=2016|issue=77|pages=36–41}}</ref>

In 1957, Treisman attended [[Somerville College, Oxford]], to work toward her [[DPhil]] under her advisor, Carolus Oldfield.<ref name="History of Research on Attention" /> Treisman conducted research on [[aphasia]], but soon pursued interest in non-clinical populations. Treisman's research was guided by [[Donald Broadbent]]'s book, ''Perception and Communication''.<ref name="Broadbent 1958">{{cite book|last=Broadbent|first=D. E.|author-link=Donald Broadbent|title=Perception and Communication|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=Elmsford, NY|year=1958}}</ref>

Treisman completed her thesis, "Selective Attention and Speech Perception", in 1962.<ref name="History of Research on Attention" />

== Career ==
Around the time Treisman was working toward her DPhil, psychology was shifting from a behaviorist point to view to the idea that behavior is the outcome of active information processing.<ref>{{cite book | last = Goldstein | first = E.B. | author-link = Bruce Goldstein | title = Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience | url = https://archive.org/details/cognitivepsychol00gold | url-access = registration | publisher = Wadsworth | location = Belmont, CA |  year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-534-57726-1 }}</ref> Donald Broadbent and [[Colin Cherry]] had recently introduced the idea of selective listening (often exemplified by the so-called "[[cocktail party effect]]")<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cherry | first = Colin | author-link = Colin Cherry | title = Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and Two Ears | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 25 |  issue = 5 | pages = 975–979 | year = 1953 | doi=10.1121/1.1907229| hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-002A-F750-3 | url = http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2309493/component/escidoc:2309492/Cherry_1953-some-.experiments.pdf | hdl-access = free }}</ref> Broadbent later proposed a Filter Model of selective attention which states that unattended auditory information is not analysed but rather it is filtered out early in the process of perception.<ref name="Broadbent 1958" /> This theory was criticised because it could not explain why unattended information sometimes gets through the "filter".

After receiving her DPhil, Treisman worked in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistics Research Unit at Oxford conducting research in selective listening.<ref name="evans">{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-018-1563-2|title=Anne Marie Treisman (1935–2018)|first=Karla K.|last=Evans|date=1 July 2018|journal=Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1027–1029|via=Springer Link|doi=10.3758/s13414-018-1563-2|pmid=29934823|s2cid=49386674}}</ref><ref name="History of Research on Attention" /> In 1964, Treisman proposed her Attenuation Theory, which modified Broadbent's Filter model by stating that unattended information is attenuated rather than completely filtered out. Treisman used a dichotic listening task during which participants heard multiple languages and different voices (male vs. female).  She showed that a difference between two equally known languages allowed no more efficient selection than a difference in subject matter between two messages in the same language. Unknown foreign languages, however, produced less interference.<ref name="Treisman 1964 206–219">{{cite journal | last = Treisman | first = Anne | title = Verbal cues, language and meaning in selective attention | journal = The American Journal of Psychology| volume = 77 |  issue = 2 | pages = 206–219 | year = 1964 | doi=10.2307/1420127| jstor = 1420127 | pmid = 14141474 }}</ref> It appeared that complete rejection of one language was almost impossible; with some degree of variability depending on physical characteristics and language of the message received. Treisman concluded that features of multiple incoming messages are successfully analysed, and that selection between messages in the same voice, intensity, and localisation takes place during, rather than before or after, this analysis, which results in the identification of their verbal content.<ref name="Treisman 1964 206–219" /> Information-handling capacity is limited following this analysis; the process handles one input at a time, either keeping to one message where possible, or switching between the two. Thus, Broadbent's suggestion that classes of words constitute separate "input channels" could be rejected. Her theory also indicated that physical characteristics are processed early, while semantic processing occurs at a later point.<ref name="Treisman 1964 206–219" /> Her work had an enormous impact on her field. For example, In 1967, while working as a visiting scientist at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]]' psychology department, she published a paper in ''Psychological Review'' that was "central to the development of selective attention as a scientific field of study".<ref>{{cite web|website=Association for Psychological Science|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/awards/james/citations/treisman.cfm|title=William James Fellow Award 2002}}</ref>

Treisman and Kahneman accepted positions at the [[University of British Columbia]] shortly after their marriage. In 1980, Treisman and Gelade published their seminal paper on Feature Integration Theory (FIT).<ref name="homepage.psy.utexas.edu">{{cite journal|last1=Treisman |first1=Anne |author1-link=Anne Treisman |last2=Gelade |first2=Garry |title=A Feature-Integration Theory of Attention |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=12 |pages=97–136 |year=1980 |issue=1 |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/psy355/gilden/treisman.pdf |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5 |pmid=7351125 |s2cid=353246 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905025042/http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf |archive-date=5 September 2008 }}</ref> One key element of FIT is that early stages of object perception encode features such as color, form, and orientation as separate entities; focused attention combines these distinct features into perceived objects.

Treisman moved to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1986, where she and Kahneman ran a joint "Attention Lab" in the Psychology Department. From 1993 until her retirement, in 2010, Treisman was a member of the Psychology Department at Princeton University. She was named Princeton's James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Psychology in 1995. Her work has appeared in 29 book chapters and more than 80 journal articles and is heavily cited in the psychological literature, as well as prominently included in both introductory and advanced textbooks. Established with an anonymous gift in 2015, the Kahneman-Treisman Center for Behavioral Science & Public Policy, housed in Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, honors the legacy of Daniel Kahneman and Anne Treisman.

=== Feature integration theory ===
{{Main|Feature integration theory}}
Treisman's feature integration theory is a two-stage model of visual object perception:

;Pre-attentive stage
The first stage is called "pre-attentive" because it happens automatically, or without effort or attention by the perceiver. In this stage, an object is broken down into its elementary features for processing (i.e., color, [[Surface texture|texture]], [[shape]], etc.). Treisman posits we are unaware of this stage of attention because it occurs quickly and early in perceptual processes (before conscious awareness).<ref name="homepage.psy.utexas.edu" />
Evidence for the pre-attentive state comes from Treisman's own studies. In a well-known study, Treisman created a display of four objects flanked by two black numbers. The display flashed on a computer screen for 1/5 of a second and followed by a random-dot masking field to eliminate residual perception of the stimuli after the stimuli were turned off. Participants were asked to first report on the black numbers, followed by what they saw at each of the four locations where the shapes had been.<ref name="Goldstein 2010">{{cite book | last = Goldstein | first = Bruce | title = Sensation and Perception | publisher = Cengage Learning | edition = 8th | location = Wadsworth | year = 2010 }}</ref> Under these conditions, participants reported seeing illusory conjunctions in 18% of trials. That is, participants reported seeing objects that consisted of a combination of features from two different stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Treisman | first = Anne | author1-link = Anne Treisman | title = Focused attention in the perception and retrieval of multidimensional stimuli | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 22 | pages = 1–11 | year = 1977 | doi=10.3758/bf03206074| doi-access = free }}</ref> For example, after seeing a big yellow circle, a big blue triangle, a small red triangle, and a small green circle, a person might report seeing a small red circle and a small green triangle.  The reason illusory conjunctions occurred is that stimuli were presented rapidly and the observers' attention was distracted from the target object by having them focus on the black numbers; thus, elementary features had not yet been grouped or bound to an object. Having participants attend to the target objects eliminated the illusory conjunction.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | last1 = Treisman | first1 = Anne | author1-link = Anne Treisman | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = Hilary | title = Illusory Conjunctions in the Perception of Objects | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 14 | pages = 107–141 | year = 1982 | issue = 1 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(82)90006-8 | pmid=7053925| s2cid = 11201516 }}</ref>

;Focused attention stage
The second stage of processing depends on attention. In this stage, the features are combined, resulting in the perception of a whole object rather than individual features.<ref name="homepage.psy.utexas.edu" /> Treisman linked this process of binding to neural activity, noting that an object causes activity in both the "what" and "where" areas of the cortex (see [[Two-streams hypothesis]]). Activity in the "what" processing stream would include information about color and form, while activity in the "where" stream would include information about location and motion. According to Treisman, attention is the "glue" that combines the information from both streams and causes us to perceive all the features of an object as combined at one specific location.<ref name="Goldstein 2010" /> Perceiving one object in isolation appears relatively straightforward, but when we confront multiple objects, numerous features may exist at different locations. The perceptual system's task is to associate each of these features with the object to which it belongs. Feature integration theory says that in order for this to occur, we need to focus our attention on each object in turn. Once we attend to a particular location, the features at that location are bound together and are associated with the object at that location.<ref name="homepage.psy.utexas.edu" />

Treisman's FIT model now uses three different spatially selective mechanisms to solve the binding problem: selection by a spatial attention window, inhibition of locations from feature maps containing unwanted features, and top-down activation of the location containing the currently attended object.<ref name="Treisman 1996 171–178">{{cite journal | last = Treisman | first = Anne | title = The binding problem | journal = Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 6 | pages = 171–178 | year = 1996 | doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(96)80070-5 | pmid=8725958 | issue=2| s2cid = 8643357 }}</ref>

=== The binding problem ===
[[William James]] discussed the connection between attention and mental processes, "Millions of items…are present to my senses which never properly enter my experience. Why? Because they have no interest for me. My experience is what I agree to attend to…Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought…. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others."<ref name="Goldstein 2010" />

In the early 1980s, neuroscientists such as [[Torsten Wiesel]] and [[David H. Hubel]] were discovering that different areas of the primate visual cortex were finely tuned to selective features, such as line orientation, luminance, color, movement, etc. These findings prompted the question of how these distinct features are connected into a unified whole. This question has been called the [[binding problem]]. For example, when you see a red ball roll by, cells sensitive to movement fire in the medial temporal cortex, while cells sensitive to color, shape and location fire in other areas. Despite all this distinct neuronal firing, you don't perceive the ball as separated by shape, movement and color perceptions; you experience an integrated experience with all these components occurring together.<ref name="Goldstein 2010" /> The question of how these elements are combined is the essence of the binding problem, a central focus of research into the late 1990s. A number of possible mechanisms were envisaged, including [[grandmother cells]] responding to specific conjunctions of features that uniquely identify a particular object;<ref>{{cite journal | last = Barlow | first = HB | title = Single units and cognition: a neuron doctrine for perceptual psychology | journal = Perception | volume = 1 | pages = 371–394 | year = 1972 | issue = 4 | doi=10.1068/p010371 | pmid=4377168| s2cid = 17487970 }}</ref> local cell assemblies onto which the pathways from different feature maps converge, perhaps with adjustable connections allowing flexible routing of signals;<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Olshausen | first1 = BA |  last2 = Anderson | first2 = CH | last3 = Van Essen | first3 = DC | title = A neurobiological model of visual attention and invariant pattern recognition based on dynamic routing of information | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 13 | pages = 4700–4719 | year = 1993 | issue = 11 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.13-11-04700.1993 | pmid = 8229193 | pmc = 6576339 | doi-access = free }}</ref> a serial scan of different spatial areas selected by an adjustable attention window, conjoining the features that each contains and excluding features from adjacent areas;<ref name="homepage.psy.utexas.edu" /> detection of temporal contiguity – parts and properties whose onset, offset or motion coincide probably belong to the same object synchronised firing of cells responding to features of the same object, perhaps assisted by oscillatory neural activity.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Milner | first = P | title = A model for visual shape recognition | journal = Psychological Review| volume = 15 | pages = 521–535 | year = 1974 | issue = 6 | doi = 10.1037/h0037149 | pmid = 4445414 }}</ref> Treisman used failures of binding to shed light on its underlying mechanisms. Specifically, she found that left-brain-damaged patients have increasing illusory conjunctions and decreased performance in a spatially cued attention task, which suggests a link between attentional binding and the [[parietal lobes]].<ref name="Treisman 1996 171–178" /> Treisman also cited corroborating evidence from [[positron emission tomography]] and [[event-related potential]] studies which were consistent with the spatial attention account of feature integration.

Treisman's work formed the basis for thousands of experiments in [[cognitive psychology]], vision sciences, [[cognitive science]], [[neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]].
