Miller's career in psychology started with research on "fear as a learned drive and its role in conflict".<ref name="Mook">{{cite book |last=Mook |first=Douglas G. |date=2004 |chapter=Neal Miller |title=Classic experiments in psychology |location=Westport, CT |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/classicexperimen0000mook/page/75 75–85] |isbn=978-0313318214 |oclc=56730032 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/classicexperimen0000mook/page/75 }}</ref> Work in behavioral medicine led him to his most notable work on [[biofeedback]].<ref name="Cohen"/> Over his lifetime he lectured at [[Yale University]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Cornell University Medical College]] and was one of the youngest members of Yale's Institute of Human Relations.

==Life and education==
Miller was born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], in 1909. He grew up in the Pacific Northwest. His father, Irving Miller, worked at [[Western Washington University]] as Chair of the Department of Education and Psychology.<ref name="APA obituary">{{cite journal |last1=Fowler |first1=Raymond |date=May 2002 |title=Running commentary: Neal Miller: a giant in American psychology |journal=APA Monitor on Psychology |volume=33 |issue=5 |page=9 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/may02/rc.aspx |access-date=2014-11-07}}</ref> His father's position in Neal Miller's words, "may have had something to do with" his interest in psychology.<ref name="Cohen"/>{{rp|244}} Originally having a curiosity for science, Miller entered the [[University of Washington]] (1931), where he studied biology, physics and also had an interest in writing. His senior year he decided that psychology would allow him to pursue his wide variety of interests.<ref name="Cohen"/> He graduated from the [[University of Washington]] with a B.S. and a piqued interest in [[behavioral psychology]]. Afterwards he studied at [[Stanford University]] (1932) where he received his M.S. and an interest in psychology of personality. At [[Stanford]] he accompanied his professor, Walter Miles, to the Institute of Human Relations at [[Yale University]] as a research assistant. There he was encouraged by another professor to further study [[psychoanalysis]].<ref name="Cohen"/> He received his Ph.D. degree in Psychology from Yale University in 1935, and that same year he became a social science research fellow at the Institute of Psychoanalysis in [[Vienna]] for one year before returning to Yale as a faculty member in 1936. He spent a total of 30 years at Yale University (1936–1966), and in 1950 he was appointed professor at Yale, a position he held until 1966. In 1966 he began teaching at [[Rockefeller University]] and afterwards spent the early 1970s teaching at [[Cornell University Medical College]]. In 1985 he returned to Yale as a research associate.<ref name="Mook"/>

==Career==
Miller's early work focused on experimenting with [[Freudian]] ideas on behavior in real-life situations. His most notable topic was [[fear]]. Miller came to the conclusion that fear could be learned through [[Fear conditioning|conditioning]]. Miller then decided to extend his research to other autonomic drives, such as [[hunger]], to see if they worked in the same way.<ref name="nealmiller.org">{{cite web |url=http://nealmiller.org/?p=188 |title=An Overview of Neal Miller's contributions |website=nealmiller.org |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref> His unique ideas and experimental techniques to study these autonomic drives resulted in findings that changed ideas about motivations and behavior.

Miller was also one of the founding fathers behind the idea of [[biofeedback]]. Today, many of his ideas have been expanded and added to, but Miller has been credited with coming up with most of the basic ideas behind biofeedback. Miller was doing experimentation on conditioning and rats when he discovered biofeedback.{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

Neal Miller, along with [[John Dollard]] and [[O. Hobart Mowrer]], helped to integrate [[behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] concepts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ewen |first=Robert B. |date=1998 |chapter=Behaviorism: controversies and emerging findings |title=Personality, a topical approach: theories, research, major controversies, and emerging findings |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lmwfc7-tPqMC&pg=PT342 230–250] |isbn=978-0805820980 |oclc=36126540}}</ref> They were able to translate psychological analytic concepts into behavioral terms that would be more easily understood. Specifically, they focused on the [[behaviorism|stimulus-response]] theory. These three men also recognized [[Sigmund Freud]]'s understanding of [[anxiety]] as a "signal of danger" and that some things in Freud's work could be altered to fix this. Miller, Dollard and Mowrer believed that a person who was relieved of high anxiety levels would experience what is called "anxiety relief". Together with fellow psychologist O. Hobart Mowrer, Miller gives his name to the "Miller-Mowrer Shuttlebox" apparatus.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dember |first1=William N. |last2=Jenkins |first2=James J. |author-link2=James J. Jenkins |date=1970 |title=General psychology: modeling behavior and experience |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/generalpsycholog00demb/page/376 376] |isbn=978-0133508437 |oclc=66521 |url=https://archive.org/details/generalpsycholog00demb/page/376 }}</ref>

Over the course of his career, Miller wrote eight books and 276 papers and articles.<ref name="nealmiller.org"/> Neal Miller worked with John Dollard and together they wrote the book ''Personality and Psychotherapy'' (1950) concerning neurosis and psychological learning concepts.

==Controversy==
Miller's regular use of laboratory animals, over many years, aroused criticism from animal rights groups, but he was a forthright defender of the practice. He once argued that if people had no right to use animals in research, then they had no right to kill them for food or clothing. Even so, Miller acknowledged that the issue was complex, saying: "There is sacredness of all life. But where do we draw the line? That's the problem. Cats kill birds and mice. Dogs exploit other animals by killing and eating them. Humans have to draw the line somewhere in animal rights, or we're dead."<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Eric |date=2 April 2002 |title=Neal E.

==Honours==
Miller served as President of the [[American Psychological Association]] from 1960–61, and received the [[APA Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Psychology|APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award]] in 1959 and the APA Citation for [[APA Award for Lifetime Contributions to Psychology|Outstanding Lifetime Contribution to Psychology]] in 1991. In 1964 he received the [[National Medal of Science]] from [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]], the first psychologist to receive this honor.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chamberlin |first=J. |date=September 2007 |title=In Brief: Psychologist wins National Medal of Science |journal=APA Monitor on Psychology |volume=38 |issue=8 |page=10 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep07/medal.aspx}}</ref> Miller is a distinguished member of [[Psi Chi|PSI CHI]] [https://www.psichi.org/page/Dist_Members#.X6_vL2gzaUk International Honor Society for Psychology].

He was also President of the Society for Neurosciences, the Biofeedback Society of America and the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
