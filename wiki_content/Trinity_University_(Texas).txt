== History ==
[[File:Trinity University Banner.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Trinity University Banner]]
[[Cumberland Presbyterian Church|Cumberland Presbyterian]]s founded Trinity in 1869 in [[Tehuacana, Texas]],  from the remnants of three small Cumberland Presbyterian colleges that had lost significant enrollment during the [[Texas in the Civil War|Civil War]]. [[John Boyd (Texas Congressman)|John Boyd]], who had served in the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] from 1836 to 1845 and in the [[Texas Senate]] from 1862 to 1863, donated 1,100 acres of land and financial assistance to establish the new university.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Cecil, Jr. |last=Harper |title=BOYD, JOHN |encyclopedia=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbo59 |date=2010-06-12 |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |access-date=2014-10-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Elizabeth LeNoir |last=Jennett |title=Biographical Directory of the Texan Conventions and Congresses, 1832-1845 |date=1942 |pages=54–55 |url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/members/bios/Bio_Directory_Texas_Convs_Congresses_1832-1845.pdf#page=49 |access-date=2015-06-13}}</ref>

[[File:Trinity University San Antonio 7-73.jpg|250px|thumb|Trinity University in [[San Antonio]]]]
[[File:Second Trinity University Campus 1.JPG|250px|thumb|Former Trinity University campus in [[Waxahachie, Texas]]]]
Believing that the school needed the support of a larger community, the university moved in 1902 to [[Waxahachie, Texas]]. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|United Presbyterian Church]]. The [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]], however, severely hindered the university's growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] placed Trinity's accreditation status on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, its leaders began to consider relocation to a larger community to improve the university's viability.

Meanwhile, in 1942, the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist]]-affiliated [[University of San Antonio]] was failing. San Antonio community leaders, who wished to maintain a [[Protestant]]-affiliated college in the city, approached Trinity with a relocation offer. The university left Waxahachie and took over the campus and alumni of the University of San Antonio. (The old Waxahachie campus is currently home to [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University]]). For the next decade, the Woodlawn campus, on the city's near-west side, was Trinity's home while it developed a permanent home. Lacking adequate facilities, the university functioned by using military [[barracks]] and [[quonset hut]]s to house students and to provide library and classroom space.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/trinity-history |title=Trinity University History |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>

In 1945, Trinity acquired a former [[limestone]] [[quarry]] for a new campus and hired Texas [[architect]] [[O'Neil Ford]] to design a master plan and many of the buildings. Construction began in 1950, and the current campus opened in 1952.

When it moved, the campus was largely undeveloped (one classroom building, one dorm, and a nearly empty library were the only completed buildings).<ref name=history/> Yet, under the leadership of Dr. James W. Laurie, the university's 14th president, Trinity took advantage of its new location in a rapidly growing major urban center to grow in academic stature.  Dr. Laurie was responsible for drastically increasing Trinity's endowment, largely funded by the [[James A. Chapman|James A. and Leta M. Chapman]] Charitable Trust of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Donald E. |last=Everett |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbt32| title=TRINITY UNIVERSITY |encyclopedia=The Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association |date=2010-06-15 |access-date=2010-11-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogersandbell.com/Trusts.aspx |title=Chapman Charitable Trusts - Preserving the Legacy of the Chapman Trusts |website=Rogers and Bell |access-date=2010-11-01}}</ref>  The stronger endowment allowed Trinity to construct a new, modern campus on its “University on the Hill” location and to increase the quality and range of its faculty while maintaining a high faculty to student ratio. In 1969, Trinity entered into a covenant agreement with the regional synod of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] that affirmed historical connections, but transformed Trinity into a private, independent university with a self-perpetuating board of trustees. The campus continues to be a "historically connected" member of the [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]].

Trinity's growth continued under Ronald Calgaard, who followed Laurie's successor, Duncan Wimpress. Under Dr. Calgaard, the university implemented a number of changes to raise its profile. For example, Trinity transformed into a residential undergraduate school, requiring all freshmen to live on campus and cutting the number of master's programs offered from more than 20 to four. Also, Trinity decreased its student population from about 3,300 to 3,000 (and eventually to 2,700), increased merit scholarships, increased the focus on national student recruitment, and began scheduling a strong series of speakers and cultural events open to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_454397/trinity-university-stakes-its-future-on-recruiting.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617073736/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_454397/trinity-university-stakes-its-future-on-recruiting.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 June 2012|title=Trinity University stakes its future on recruiting intelligence 04/05/1987 - Archives - Chron.com - Houston Chronicle|date=17 June 2012|access-date=16 November 2018}}</ref>

Calgaard's successor, [[John R. Brazil]], focused on replacing outdated campus buildings and improving the school's financial resources.  The "Campaign for Trinity University", which launched in September 2005, sought to raise US$200 million for a variety of purposes.  At its conclusion on September 25, 2009, the campaign raised $205.9 million, surpassing the original goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |date=2009-09-25 |title=Trinity University’s Capital Campaign Totals $205.9 Million |publisher=Trinity University |access-date=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222024740/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |archive-date=February 22, 2012 }}</ref> Dr. Brazil served as Trinity's president through January 2010.

[[Dennis A.

Academically, Trinity refined its curriculum to further define a liberal arts education, developed an entrepreneurship program, and realigned the business program.  Trinity also refocused its marketing to raise the university's national profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/university-president-step-down-2015 | title=University President to Step Down in 2015 | publisher=Trinity University | date=2014-05-14 }}</ref> Finally, under Ahlburg, Trinity built the Center for Sciences and Innovation, which modernized and combined science facilities to ease collaboration across disciplines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/university-president-step-down-2015 |title=University President to Step Down in 2015|publisher=Trinity University |date=May 15, 2014 }}</ref>

== Academics and rankings ==
[[File:Trinity University Sign.png|thumb|150px|left]]
As defined by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|Carnegie Foundation]]'s classification, Trinity University is a small, highly residential university with a majority of enrollments coming from undergraduate students. The full-time, four-year undergraduate program is classified as "more selective, lower transfer-in" and has an arts and sciences focus with some graduate student coexistence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=229267 |title=Trinity University |website=Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Learning |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> Trinity is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Full-time undergraduate tuition is $44,680 for the 2019-20 academic year; room and board are an additional $13,584.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tuition and Fees |url=https://new.trinity.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-fees |access-date=15 April 2019}}</ref>

=== Academics ===
Trinity offers 47 majors and 59 minors in the traditional [[liberal arts]], business, [[Natural science|sciences]], [[fine arts]], and [[engineering]], and graduate programs in [[accounting]], [[teaching]], [[school psychology]], [[Academic administration|school administration]], and [[health care|health care administration]]<ref name="Fast Facts">{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/fast-facts |title=Fast Facts |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> and is the only university in San Antonio to offer a minor in [[creative writing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/academics/majors-minors/creative-writing|website=Trinity University|title=Creative Writing|access-date=15 April 2019}}</ref> Trinity stresses close interaction between students and faculty members across all disciplines, with a 9:1 student/faculty ratio. The full-time faculty numbers 228, 98% of whom hold a [[Ph.D]]. or other terminal degree in their field.  About 47% of the student body has studied abroad in over 35 countries.

All undergraduates must demonstrate proficiency across a broad range of academic disciplines, regardless of major. At its core, the Common Curriculum<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inside.trinity.edu/student-success/advising/common-curriculum |website=Inside Trinity |title=Common Curriculum |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> provides the liberal arts foundation for all undergraduate degrees awarded by Trinity. The Common Curriculum consists of the following components:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x28972.xml |title=Courses of Study 2013-14 |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>

'''''The First-Year Experience (FYE) Program'''''
Starting in fall 2015, all first-year students must complete a 6-credit hour course in their first semester that meets five days a week. The FYE consists of a writing workshop, discussion seminar, and a common day where everyone from the different sections meet for guest speakers, student conferences, or library sessions to assist students in the research process.

'''''Foreign Language, Computer, and Mathematics Skills'''''
*Foreign Languages 
Trinity students must reach a minimum level of competence corresponding to that attained after successful completion of the first semester of the second year of college foreign language study. An international baccalaureate course at higher level with a 6 or 7 or an AP language test score of 3 or higher will suffice in most cases.  
*Computer Skills
Students must be able to use computers to collect, organize, analyze and communicate information in an academic environment. Students who do not pass a test demonstrating these competencies must fulfill this requirement by completing an approved course built around these criteria.
*Mathematics 
Trinity requires completion of three years of high school mathematics, including either trigonometry or precalculus, for admission as a first-year student. While there is no further requirement, all students are urged to undertake further study of mathematics at Trinity.

40 percent of students attend graduate school immediately after earning their bachelor's, and 65 percent of all students attend within five years of graduation.<ref>[http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121033620/http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf |date=January 21, 2013 }}</ref>

An analysis by the Office of Institutional Research indicated that Trinity has made considerable progress in the number of graduates going on to earn doctoral degrees. Of students earning a bachelor's between 1982 and 1986, 2.9% went on to earn doctorates; of those earning a bachelor's between 1997 and 2001, 8.5% had. Trinity improved its ranking in this category from 328th to 38th among other colleges and universities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x402.xml |website=Trinity University |title=Office of Institutional Research |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>
