While 'subjective well-being' is more precise, it simply does not have the convening power of 'happiness'. The main linguistic argument for using happiness in a broader generic role is that happiness plays two important roles within the science of well-being, appearing once as a prototypical positive emotion and again as part of a cognitive life evaluation question. This double use has sometimes been used to argue that there is no coherent structure to happiness responses. The converse argument made in the World Happiness Reports is that this double usage helps to justify using happiness in a generic role, as long as the alternative meanings are clearly understood and credibly related. Evidence from a growing number of large scale surveys shows that the answers to questions asking about the emotion of happiness differ from answers to judgmental questions asking about a person's happiness with life as a whole in exactly the ways that theory would suggest. Answers to questions about the emotion of happiness relate well to what is happening at the moment. Evaluative answers, in response to questions about life as a whole, are supported by positive emotions, as noted above, but also driven much more, than are answers to questions about emotions, by a variety of life circumstances, including income, health and social trust.}} quoted in {{cite journal | last=Helliwell | first=John F. | title=What's Special About Happiness as a Social Indicator? | journal=Social Indicators Research | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=135 | issue=3 | date=2017-02-25 | issn=0303-8300 | doi=10.1007/s11205-017-1549-9 | pages=965–968}}</ref>

[[File:The happy butcher.jpg|thumb|A butcher happily slicing meat]]
{{Main|Philosophy of happiness}}

===Happiness in relation to morality===
[[Philosophy of happiness]] is often discussed in conjunction with [[ethics]]. Traditional European societies, inherited from the Greeks and from Christianity, often linked happiness with morality, which was concerned with the performance in a certain kind of role in a certain kind of social life. However, with the rise of individualism, begotten partly by Protestantism and capitalism, the links between duty in a society and happiness were gradually broken. The consequence was a redefinition of the moral terms.  Happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life, but in terms of individual psychology. Happiness, however, remains a difficult term for moral philosophy. Throughout the history of moral philosophy, there has been an oscillation between attempts to define morality in terms of consequences leading to happiness and attempts to define morality in terms that have nothing to do with happiness at all.<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacIntyre |first1=Alasdair |title=A Short History of Ethics |url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryethi00maci_019 |url-access=limited |date=1998 |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryethi00maci_019/page/n181 167] |isbn=9780415173988 |edition=Second}}</ref>

===Aristotle===
Aristotle described ''[[eudaimonia]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:εὐδαιμονία|εὐδαιμονία]]) as the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is often translated to mean happiness, but some scholars contend that "human flourishing" may be a more accurate translation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Robinson | first=Daniel N. | title=Aristotle's psychology | publisher=Joe Christensen Inc | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-9672066-0-8 | oclc=48601517 | page=}}</ref> Aristotle's use of the term in Nicomachiean Ethics extends beyond the general sense of happiness.<ref>Aristotle, Bartlett, R. C., & Collins, S. D. (2011). Aristotle's Nicomachean ethics. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', written in 350 BCE, [[Aristotle]] stated that happiness (also being well and doing well) is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy. For Aristotle the term ''[[eudaimonia]]'', which is translated as 'happiness' or 'flourishing' is an activity rather than an emotion or a state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aristotle And His Definition Of Happiness - Overview|url=https://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/aristotle/#:~:text=According%20to%20Aristotle,%20happiness%20consists,which%20may%20be%20very%20difficult.|access-date=18 March 2021|website=www.pursuit-of-happiness.org}}</ref> Eudaimonia (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) is a classical Greek word consists of the word "eu" ("good" or "well-being") and "daimōn" ("spirit" or "minor deity", used by extension to mean one's lot or fortune). Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way. Specifically, Aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity.  He arrived at this claim with the "Function Argument". Basically, if it is right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For Aristotle human function is to reason, since it is that alone which humans uniquely do. And performing one's function well, or excellently, is good. According to Aristotle, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle argued a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.4324/9781315248233-2 |chapter=Revisiting Aristotle: In Pursuit of Happiness |title=Negotiating the Good Life |year=2017 |pages=15–46 |isbn=978-1-315-24823-3 }}</ref> The key question Aristotle seeks to answer is "What is the ultimate purpose of human existence?" a lot of people are seeking pleasure, health, and a good reputation. It is true that those have a value, but none of them can occupy the place of the greatest good for which humanity aims. It may seem like all goods are a means to obtain happiness, but Aristotle said that happiness is always an end in itself.

===Happiness and Western ethics===
Western [[ethics|ethicists]] have made arguments for how humans should behave, either individually or collectively, based on the resulting happiness of such behavior. [[Utilitarian]]s, such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]], advocated the [[greatest happiness principle]] as a guide for ethical behavior.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mill |first1=John Stuart |title=Utilitarianism |date=1879 |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11224/11224-h/11224-h.htm}}</ref>

===Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] critiqued the English Utilitarians' focus on attaining the greatest happiness, stating that "Man does not strive for happiness, only the Englishman does." Nietzsche meant that making happiness one's ultimate ''goal'' and the aim of one's existence, in his words "makes one contemptible." Nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher, more difficult goals than "mere happiness." He introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the "last man" as a kind of [[thought experiment]] against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers. these small, "last men" who seek after only their own pleasure and health, avoiding all danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle are meant to seem contemptible to Nietzsche's reader. Nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult, what can only be earned through struggle, difficulty, pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and ''unhappiness'' truly play in creating everything of great worth in life, including all the highest achievements of human culture, not least of all philosophy.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy|encyclopedia=stanford.edu|access-date=10 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112064629/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|archive-date=12 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=10 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815204318/http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/|archive-date=15 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Changes in focus over time===

====Hinduism====
In [[Advaita Vedanta]], the ultimate goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]] is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the Self in all.

====Confucianism====
The Chinese Confucian thinker [[Mencius]], who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during China's Warring States period, was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the "lesser self" (the physiological self) and the "greater self" (the moral self), and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage-hood. He argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one's "vital force" with "righteous deeds", then that force would shrivel up (Mencius, 6A:15 2A:2). More specifically, he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues, especially through music.<ref>{{cite book | last = Chan | first = Wing-tsit | title = A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy | url = https://archive.org/details/sourcebookinchin00chan | url-access = registration | location = Princeton, NJ | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1963 | isbn = 978-0-691-01964-2}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref>

==== Roman Catholicism ====
The primary meaning of "happiness" in various European languages involves good fortune, chance or happening. The meaning in Greek philosophy, however, refers primarily to ethics.

In [[Catholicism]], the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity, Latin equivalent to the Greek ''[[eudaimonia]]'', or "blessed happiness", described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a [[Beatific Vision]] of God's essence in the next life.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Question 3. What is happiness |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/200308.htm |journal=[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]] |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Aquinas |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011133516/http://newadvent.org/summa/200308.htm |archive-date=11 October 2007 }}</ref>

According to [[St. Augustine]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], man's last end is happiness: "all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm#article4 |title=Summa Theologica: Man's last end (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 1) |publisher=Newadvent.org |access-date=26 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105095827/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm#article4 |archive-date=5 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, where utilitarians focused on reasoning about consequences as the primary tool for reaching happiness, Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts, but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts, such as habits according to [[virtue]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Secunda Secundae Partis |publisher=Newadvent.org |access-date=26 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518035222/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3.htm |archive-date=18 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In turn, which habits and acts that normally lead to happiness is according to Aquinas caused by laws: [[natural law]] and [[divine law]]. These laws, in turn, were according to Aquinas caused by a first cause, or God.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

According to Aquinas, happiness consists in an "operation of the speculative intellect": "Consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of Divine things." And, "the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect." So: "Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article2 |title=Summa Theologica: What is happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 3) |publisher=Newadvent.org |access-date=26 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109063700/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article2 |archive-date=9 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Human complexities, like reason and cognition, can produce well-being or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In temporal life, the contemplation of God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. ''Beatitudo'', or perfect happiness, as complete well-being, is to be attained not in this life, but the next.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Happiness|work=newadvent.org|access-date=7 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501191841/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm|archive-date=1 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Self-fulfilment theories===
[[File:Sweet Baby Kisses Family Love.jpg|thumb|Woman kissing a baby on the cheek]]

====Maslow's hierarchy of needs====
[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, [[self-actualization]] is reached. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as [[peak experiences]], profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the [[Flow (psychology)|flow]] concept of [[Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alexander |first1=Rebecca |last2=Aragón |first2=Oriana R. |last3=Bookwala |first3=Jamila |last4=Cherbuin |first4=Nicolas |last5=Gatt |first5=Justine M. |last6=Kahrilas |first6=Ian J. |last7=Kästner |first7=Niklas |last8=Lawrence |first8=Alistair |last9=Lowe |first9=Leroy |last10=Morrison |first10=Robert G. |last11=Mueller |first11=Sven C. |last12=Nusslock |first12=Robin |last13=Papadelis |first13=Christos |last14=Polnaszek |first14=Kelly L. |last15=Helene Richter |first15=S. |last16=Silton |first16=Rebecca L. |last17=Styliadis |first17=Charis |title=The neuroscience of positive emotions and affect: Implications for cultivating happiness and wellbeing |journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews |date=February 2021 |volume=121 |pages=220–249 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.12.002 |pmid=33307046 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time. Our intense focus causes us to forget any other issues, which in return promotes positive emotions.

====Erich Fromm====
[[Erich Fromm|Fromm]] said ''"Happiness is the indication that man has found the answer to the problem of human existence: the productive realization of his potentialities and thus, simultaneously, being one with the world and preserving the integrity of his self. In spending his energy productively he increases his powers, he „burns without being consumed.""''<ref>(Ex 3:2) ― (1947a: Man for Himself. An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics, New York (Rinehart and Co.) 1947, p. 189.)</ref>

====Self-determination theory====
[[File:Girl of Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Smiling woman from Vietnam]]
[[Self-determination theory]] relates [[intrinsic motivation]] to three needs: [[Competence (human resources)|competence]], [[autonomy]], and [[Social relation|relatedness]].

====Modernization and freedom of choice====
[[Ronald Inglehart]] has traced cross-national differences in the level of happiness based on data from the [[World Values Survey]].<ref name="Inglehart2008">{{cite journal |last1=Inglehart |first1=Ronald |last2=Foa |first2=Roberto |last3=Peterson |first3=Christopher |last4=Welzel |first4=Christian |title=Development, Freedom, and Rising Happiness: A Global Perspective (1981–2007) |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |date=July 2008 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=264–285 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00078.x|pmid=26158947 |s2cid=10046821 }}</ref> He finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness. When [[basic needs]] are satisfied, the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives. Happiness also depends on religion in countries where free choice is constrained.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Inglehart |first1=Ronald F. |title=Cultural Evolution: People's Motivations Are Changing, and Reshaping the World |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/9781108613880 |isbn=978-1-108-61388-0 }}</ref>

===Indirect approaches===
Various writers, including [[Camus]] and [[Eckhart Tolle|Tolle]], have written that the act of searching or seeking for happiness is incompatible with being happy.<ref>"You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life." Albert Camus, in "Intuitions" (October 1932), published in Youthful Writings (1976)</ref><ref>"Don't Seek Happiness. If you seek it, you won't find it, because seeking is the antithesis of happiness" Eckhart Tolle, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose</ref><ref>"Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly. It comes as a by-product of providing a useful service." Henry Ford</ref><ref>Frank Crane wrote that "nobody who pursued happiness ever found it" (Adventures in Common Sense, 1920, [https://archive.org/details/adventuresincom00crangoog/page/n52/mode/2up?q=happiness p49])</ref>

[[John Stuart Mill]] believed that for the great majority of people happiness is best achieved en passant, rather than striving for it directly. This meant no self-consciousness, scrutiny, self-interrogation, dwelling on, thinking about, 
imagining or questioning on one's happiness. Then, if otherwise fortunately circumstanced, one would "inhale happiness with the air you breathe."<ref>"The enjoyments of life (such was now my theory) are sufficient to make it a pleasant thing, when they are taken en passant, without being made a principal object. Once make them so, and they are immediately felt to be insufficient. They will not bear a scrutinizing examination. Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so. The only chance is to treat, not happiness, but some end external to it, as the purpose of life. Let your self-consciousness, your scrutiny, your self-interrogation, exhaust themselves on that; and if otherwise fortunately circumstanced you will inhale happiness with the air you breathe, without dwelling on it or thinking about it, without either forestalling it in imagination, or putting it to flight by fatal questioning. This theory now became the basis of my philosophy of life. And I still hold to it as the best theory for all those who have but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity for enjoyment; that is, for the great majority of mankind."

==Negative effects of happiness==

[[June Gruber]] has argued that happiness may have negative effects. It may trigger a person to be more sensitive, more gullible, less successful, and more likely to undertake high risk behaviours.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Too much Happiness Can Make You Unhappy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/too-much-happiness-can-make-you-unhappy-studies-show/2012/04/02/gIQACELLrS_story.html|access-date=|website=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=New study sheds light on 'dark side of happiness', 2011|work=Boston.com|url=http://archive.boston.com/lifestyle/health/articles/2011/05/23/new_study_sheds_light_on_dark_side_of_happiness/|access-date=8 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="gruberpeplab.com"/><ref name="Can Seeking Happiness Make People H"/>

==Possible limits on happiness==
[[Sigmund Freud#Happiness|Sigmund Freud]] said that all humans strive after happiness, but that the possibilities of achieving it are restricted because we "are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from the [[Status quo|state of things]]."<ref>Freud, S.

== Examining happiness==
Happiness can be examined in experiential and evaluative contexts. Experiential well-being, or "objective happiness", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as "How good or bad is your experience now?". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as "How good was your vacation?" and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in [[reconstructive memory]], but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. The two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the [[peak–end rule]].<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Huppert|editor-first1=Felicia A|editor-last2=Baylis|editor-first2=Nick|editor-last3=Keverne|editor-first3=Barry|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|author1-link=Daniel Kahneman|first2=Jason|last2=Riis|title=The science of well-being|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-856752-3|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198567523.003.0011|chapter-url=https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/Living_DK_JR_2005.pdf|access-date=1 April 2017|language=en|chapter=Living, and thinking about it: two perspectives on life|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/marketing_papers/405}}</ref>

Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |last1=Deci |first1=Edward L. |last2=Ryan |first2=Richard M. |title=Hedonia, eudaimonia, and well-being: an introduction |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9018-1 |s2cid=145367475 }}</ref>

== Measurement==
People have been trying to measure happiness for centuries. In 1780, the English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham proposed that as happiness was the primary goal of humans it should be measured as a way of determining how well the government was performing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tokumitsu|first=Miya|date=June 2017|title=Did the Fun Work?|url=https://thebaffler.com/salvos/did-fun-work-tokumitsu|journal=The Baffler|volume=35|access-date=3 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725124256/https://thebaffler.com/salvos/did-fun-work-tokumitsu|archive-date=25 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Several scales have been developed to measure happiness:

* The [[Subjective Happiness Scale]] (SHS) is a four-item scale, measuring global subjective happiness from 1999.  The scale requires participants to use absolute ratings to characterize themselves as happy or unhappy individuals, as well as it asks to what extent they identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/subjectivehappinessscale.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522230648/http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/subjectivehappinessscale.pdf |archive-date=22 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lyubomirsky |first1=Sonja |last2=Lepper |first2=Heidi S. |date=February 1999 |title=A Measure of Subjective Happiness: Preliminary Reliability and Construct Validation |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=137–55 |jstor=27522363 |doi=10.1023/A:1006824100041 |s2cid=28334702 }}</ref>
* The [[Affect measures#PANAS|Positive and Negative Affect Schedule]] (PANAS) from 1988 is a 20-item questionnaire, using a five-point Likert scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely) to assess the relation between personality traits and positive or negative affects at "this moment, today, the past few days, the past week, the past few weeks, the past year, and in general".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=David |last2=Clark |first2=Lee A. |last3=Tellegen |first3=Auke |title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1063–70 |year=1988 |pmid=3397865 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063 }}</ref> A longer version with additional affect scales was published 1994.<ref>{{cite | last=Watson | first=David | last2=Clark | first2=Lee Anna | title=The PANAS-X: Manual for the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form | publisher=The University of Iowa | year=1994 | doi=10.17077/48vt-m4t2 |doi-access=free}}</ref>
* The [[Satisfaction with Life Scale]] (SWLS) is a global cognitive assessment of [[life satisfaction]] developed by [[Ed Diener]]. A seven-point Likert scale is used to agree or disagree with five statements about one's life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tbims.org/combi/swls/swlsrat.html|title=SWLS Rating Form|work=tbims.org|access-date=1 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416031915/http://www.tbims.org/combi/swls/swlsrat.html|archive-date=16 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Diener |first1=Ed |last2=Emmons |first2=Robert A. |last3=Larsen |first3=Randy J. |last4=Griffin |first4=Sharon |title=The Satisfaction With Life Scale |journal=Journal of Personality Assessment |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=71–75 |year=1985 |pmid=16367493 |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4901_13 }}</ref>

Respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://worldhappiness.report/faq/ | title=FAQ | access-date=27 January 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181231184939/http://worldhappiness.report/faq/ | archive-date=31 December 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1047"/>
* Positive Experience; the survey by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] asks if, the day before, people experienced enjoyment, laughing or smiling a lot, feeling well-rested, being treated with respect, learning or doing something interesting. 9 of the top 10 countries in 2018 were [[South American]], led by [[Paraguay]] and [[Panama]]. Country scores range from 85 to 43.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gallup.com/analytics/248906/gallup-global-emotions-report-2019.aspx|title=Gallup 2019 Global Emotions Report|first=Gallup|last=Inc|website=Gallup.com}}</ref>

Since 2012, a [[World Happiness Report]] has been published. Happiness is evaluated, as in "How happy are you with your life as a whole?", and in emotional reports, as in "How happy are you now?," and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the report identifies the countries with the highest levels of happiness. In subjective well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Helliwell |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Layard |editor3-first=Jeffrey |editor3-last=Sachs |year=2012 |title=World Happiness Report |isbn=978-0-9968513-0-5 |url=http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2012/ |access-date=5 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718204801/http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2012/ |archive-date=18 July 2016 |url-status=live }}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref> {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

When discussing genetics and their effects on individuals it is important to first understand that genetics do not predict behavior. It is possible for genes to increase the likelihood of individuals being happier compared to others, but they do not 100 percent predict behavior.

At this point in scientific research, it has been hard to find a lot of evidence to support this idea that happiness is affected in some way by genetics. In a 2016 study Michael Minkov and Michael Harris Bond found that a gene by the name of SLC6A4 was not a good predictor of happiness level in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Minkov |first1=Michael |last2=Bond |first2=Michael Harris |title=A Genetic Component to National Differences in Happiness |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |date=April 2017 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=321–340 |doi=10.1007/s10902-015-9712-y |s2cid=54717193 }}</ref>

On the other hand, there have been many studies that have found genetics to be a key part in predicting and understanding happiness in humans. In a review article discussing many studies on genetics and happiness they discussed the common findings. The author found an important factor that has affected scientist findings this being how happiness is measured. For example, in certain studies when subjective wellbeing is measured as a trait heredity is found to be higher, about 70 to 90 percent. In another study 11,500 unrelated genotypes were studied, and the conclusion was the heritability was only 12 to 18 percent. Overall, this article found the common percent of heredity was about 20 to 50 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nes |first1=Ragnhild Bang |last2=Røysamb |first2=Espen |title=Happiness in Behaviour Genetics: An Update on Heritability and Changeability |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |date=October 2017 |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=1533–1552 |doi=10.1007/s10902-016-9781-6 |s2cid=145034246 }}</ref>

In politics, ''happiness'' as a guiding ideal is expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], as the universal right to "the pursuit of happiness."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schlesinger |first1=Arthur M. |title=The Lost Meaning of "The Pursuit of Happiness" |journal=The William and Mary Quarterly |volume=21 |issue=3 |year=1964 |pages=325–27 |jstor=1918449 |doi=10.2307/1918449 }}</ref> This seems to suggest a subjective interpretation but one that goes beyond emotions alone. It has to be kept in mind that the word ''happiness'' meant "prosperity, thriving, wellbeing" in the 18th century and not the same thing as it does today. In fact, ''happiness''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fountain|first1=Ben|title=Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign|access-date=19 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123161503/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Common market health measures such as [[GDP]] and [[GNP]] have been used as a measure of successful policy.

Since 2003, empirical research in the field of [[happiness economics]], such as that by [[Benjamin Radcliff]], professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, supported the contention that in democratic countries life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous [[social safety net]], pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions.<ref>[[Benjamin Radcliff|Radcliff, Benjamin]] (2013) ''The Political Economy of Human Happiness'' (New York: Cambridge University Press).{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref><ref>See also '''this collection of full-text peer reviewed scholarly articles on this subject''' by Radcliff and colleagues (from "Social Forces," "The Journal of Politics," and "Perspectives on Politics," among others) [http://benjaminradcliff.com/scholarly-articles/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200741/http://benjaminradcliff.com/scholarly-articles/ |date=12 July 2015 }}{{synthesis inline|date=August 2016}}</ref> Similarly, there is evidence that public policies which reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affect average levels of well-being.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/14/does-a-higher-minimum-wage-make-people-happier/|title=Does a higher minimum wage make people happier?|author=Michael Krassa|date=14 May 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=29 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707112256/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/14/does-a-higher-minimum-wage-make-people-happier/|archive-date=7 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Good [[mental health]] and good relationships contribute more than income to happiness and governments should take these into account.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38285223 Mental health and relationships 'key to happiness'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316084200/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38285223 |date=16 March 2018 }} ''[[BBC]]''</ref>
