He is a [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]].

== Early life ==
Isărescu was born in [[Drăgășani]], [[Vâlcea County]]. His father was a school teacher who, after the establishment of the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian People's Republic]], studied at the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, worked as a bank executive during the 1950s, and then he was a professor of accounting for 20 years.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Faţa nevăzută a lui Mugur Isărescu, guvernatorul pasionat de desene animate: "Pot fredona sau chiar dansa ca ursul Baloo"|url = http://adevarul.ro/economie/bani/mugur-isarescu-desene-animate-1_51aa121cc7b855ff5649a641/index.html|access-date = 2015-07-25|newspaper= [[Adevărul]]|date = 2013-06-01}}</ref>

Isărescu studied [[international trade]] at the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies|Academy of Economic Studies]] of [[Bucharest]], which he graduated in 1971,<ref name=":0" /> and where he was an [[assistant professor]] between 1975 and 1989.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.agerpres.ro/flux-documentare/2015/09/04/documentar-25-de-ani-de-la-numirea-lui-mugur-isarescu-in-functia-de-guvernator-general-al-bancii-nationale-a-romaniei-07-37-26|title=25 de ani de la numirea lui Mugur Isărescu în funcția de guvernator general al Băncii Naționale a României|date=2015-09-04|publisher=[[Agerpres]]|access-date=2016-08-03}}</ref> In 1989, Isărescu defended his PhD thesis on [[exchange rate]] policies under the supervision of [[Costin Kirițescu]].<ref name=":2" />

For 19 years, he worked as a researcher for the [[Institute of International Economics]]. He took a number of courses in the United States, writing several papers on [[capitalism|capitalist economics]].<ref name=":0" /> Isărescu claims it was as if he prepared for 20 years for the 1990 moment.<ref name=":0" />

During this period he gave notes under several aliases to the Communist Secret Services about ladies with different problems, about colleagues and about the foreigners he was meeting. One alias Isarescu was using to sign the information notes is “Manole”.{{CN|date=November 2021}}

In February 1990, after the [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989, he began working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<ref name=":2" /> In March 1990, he was sent to work as an economic and monetary affairs secretary at the Romanian Embassy in the [[United States]],<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Banca Națională a României - Guvernatorul BNR|url = http://www.bnro.ro/Guvernatorul-BNR-5912.aspx|publisher = [[National Bank of Romania]]|access-date = 2015-07-25}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> being in charge of handling Romania's relations with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]].<ref name=":2" />

He expected that Romania would need IMF help within a couple of years, but he was surprised to find that the government depleted the [[foreign-exchange reserves]] within six months and, as such, he was recalled to Romania in July 1990 to head the National Bank.<ref name=":0" />

==Governor of the National Bank of Romania==
In September 1990 he was named Governor of the [[National Bank of Romania]] by the Romanian government.<ref name=":1" /> During the early years, he negotiated several agreements with the International Monetary Fund.<ref name=":0" /> His mandate was renewed by the [[Parliament of Romania]] in 1991, 1998, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019.<ref name=":1" />

According to a World Record Academy article, Isărescu managed in 19 years of leadership at the National Bank of Romania to create and maintain a mysterious aura around the policies of the National Bank, and many pointed out that the agenda of the Bank remained independent from any [[Romanian Government]]. The same article states that many credit the National Bank team for saving [[Economy of Romania|Romania's economy]] from a [[Bulgaria]]n-type collapse, raising the national [[gold]] and [[Euro]] reserves beyond needs, cutting down [[inflation]] to single-digit figures and introducing the [[Romanian leu|New Leu]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title = Longest Serving Central Bank Governor-world record set by Mugur Isarescu|url = https://www.worldrecordacademy.com/business/longest_serving_central_bank_Governor-world_record_set_by_Mugur_Isarescu_90280.htm}}</ref>

He was involved in a series of legislative debates regarding some consumer protection laws, as "datio in solutium" and [[Swiss franc]] to [[Romanian leu]] conversion, when he had a pronounced role, strongly supporting banks against Romanian debtors, in last two years.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|title = Conversia creditelor din franci elvețieni (CHF) în lei la cursul de la data acordării.

In 2009, [[World Records Academy]] named him as the longest-serving governor of a [[central bank]].<ref name=":3" /><ref>http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/isarescu-a-intrat-in-cartea-recordurilor-859477.html</ref>

==Prime Minister of Romania==
In 1999, Isărescu was asked to become Prime Minister of Romania, which he accepted on the condition that he could return to the National Bank after it was over.<ref name=":0" /> Then-President [[Emil Constantinescu]] agreed with the terms<ref name=":0" /> and on 16 December 1999 Isărescu was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Romania]], but only for about a year, since in November 2000, the ruling coalition [[2000 Romanian general election|lost the election]].

In November 2000 Isărescu [[2000 Romanian presidential election|ran]] for [[President of Romania]] but was soundly defeated, coming in fourth place and receiving 9% of the vote. Thereafter, he returned to the [[National Bank of Romania]] for another term as governor.

Although Isărescu served only one year as [[Prime Minister]], Isărescu is considered{{by whom|date=July 2010}} to have started the reform process{{clarify|date=June 2014}}, continued later by [[Adrian Năstase]] and [[Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu]]. During his premiership, on February 15, 2000, Romania formally initiated negotiations with the [[European Union]] (a process started by the Romanian application in 1995 and European Commission approval on October 13, 1999<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ue.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&id=351|title=REPREZENTANȚA PERMANENTĂ A ROMÂNIEI la Uniunea Europeană|website=ue.mae.ro}}</ref>). As governor of the [[National Bank of Romania]], Mugur Isărescu has coordinated [[Romania]]'s economic policy since 1990.

Isărescu was considered several times between 2009 and 2012 as a suitable replacement for [[Emil Boc]] as [[Prime Minister of Romania]]. Isărescu declined the offer from President [[Traian Băsescu|Băsescu]], refusing to re-assume his former office in order to remain Governor of [[National Bank of Romania|BNR]].
