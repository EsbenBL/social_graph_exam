==Personal life and education==
His parents, Sara Günsberg (born in 1895) and Menachem Lazar Wallerstein (born in 1890), were [[Polish Jews]] from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] who moved to [[Berlin]], where they married in 1919, due to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Two years later, Sara gave birth to their first son, [[Robert S. Wallerstein|Solomon]]. In 1923, the Wallerstein family emigrated to [[New York City|New York]], where Immanuel was born.<ref name=minakowski>{{cite web | url = http://minakowski.pl/wallerstein-to-polak-sa-dokumenty/ | title = Wallerstein to Polak, są dokumenty | author = M. J. Minakowski | date = May 27, 2018 | access-date = September 2, 2019 | language = pl}}</ref> On the "list of alien passengers for the United States" at the time of his family's emigration, the nationality of his mother and brother was described as Polish.<ref name=minakowski/>

Having grown up in a politically conscious family, Wallerstein first became interested in world affairs as a teenager.<ref name=Wall2000/> He received all three of his degrees from [[Columbia University]]: a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1951, an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1954, and a [[PhD]] in 1959, where he completed his dissertation under the supervision of Hans L. Zetterberg and Robert Staughton Lynd.<ref name=dissertation /> However, throughout his life, Wallerstein also studied at other universities around the world, including [[Oxford University]] from 1955 to 1956,<ref name=Sica> Sica, Alan. 2005. "Immanuel Wallerstein". Pp. 734–739 in ''Social Thought: from the Enlightenment to the present''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.</ref> [[Université libre de Bruxelles]], [[Paris Diderot University|Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot]], and [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]].

From 1951 to 1953 Wallerstein served in the [[U.S. Army]].<ref name=Wall2000/> After his discharge, he wrote a master's thesis on [[McCarthyism]] as a phenomenon of American political culture. The widely cited work, as Wallerstein himself later stated, "confirmed my sense that I should consider myself, in the language of the 1950s, a 'political sociologist{{Single double}}.<ref name=Wall2000/>

==Academic career==
Wallerstein's academic and professional career began at Columbia University where he was first an instructor and then associate professor of sociology from 1958 to 1971.<ref name=Sica/> During his time there he became a prominent supporter of the students during the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]].<ref>Ed. Lemert, Charles. 2010. "Immanuel Wallerstein." Pp. 398–405 in Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classical Readings. Westview Press.</ref> In 1971 he moved from New York to Montreal, where he taught at [[McGill University]] for five years.<ref name=Sica/>

Originally, Wallerstein's prime area of intellectual concern was not American politics, but the politics of the non-European world, most especially of India and Africa.<ref name=Wall2000/> For two decades Wallerstein [[African studies|researched Africa]], publishing numerous books and articles,<ref name=Wall2000/> and in 1973 he became president of the [[African Studies Association]].<ref name=IWcom>Wallerstein, I. (April 2009). Curriculum Vitae. Retrieved from http://iwallerstein.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/iwallerstein-cv-eng-09.pdf</ref>

In 1976 Wallerstein was offered the unique opportunity to pursue a new avenue of research, and so became head of the [[Fernand Braudel Center|Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems and Civilization]] at [[Binghamton University]] in New York,<ref>Sica, Alan. 2005. "Immanuel Wallerstein." Pp. 734–739 in Social Thought: from the Enlightenment to the present. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.</ref> whose mission was "to engage in the analysis of large-scale social change over long periods of historical time".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://binghamton.edu/fbc/about-fbc/intellectual-report.html | title=Binghamton University – Fernand Braudel Center: About FBC: Intellectual Report}}</ref> The Center opened with the publishing support of a new journal, ''Review'',<ref name=Sica/> (of which Wallerstein was the founding editor), and would go on to produce a body of work that "went a long way toward invigorating sociology and its sister disciplines, especially history and [[Political economy|political-economy]]".<ref name=Sica/> Wallerstein would serve as a distinguished professor of sociology at Binghamton until his retirement in 1999.<ref name=IWcom/>

During his career Wallerstein held visiting-professor posts in [[Chinese University of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], British Columbia, and Amsterdam, among numerous others.<ref name=Allan06>{{cite book|last= Allan|first= Kenneth|title= Contemporary social and sociological theory: visualizing social worlds|url= https://archive.org/details/contemporarysoci00alla|url-access= registration|year= 2006|publisher= Pine Forge Press|location= Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn= 9781412913621}}</ref> He was awarded multiple honorary titles, intermittently served as Directeur d'études associé at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris, and served as president of the [[International Sociological Association]] between 1994 and 1998.<ref name=Lemert2010>{{cite book|editor-last= Lemert|editor-first= Charles|title= Social theory : the multicultural and classic readings|year= 2010|publisher= Westview Press|location= Boulder, CO |isbn= 9780813343921|edition= 4th}}</ref> Similarly, during the 1990s he chaired the [[Gulbenkian Commission| Gulbenkian Commission on the Restructuring of the Social Sciences]], whose object was to indicate a direction for social scientific inquiry for the next 50 years.<ref name=Wallerstein>{{cite web|last= Wallerstein|first= Wallerstein|title= Immanuel Wallerstein|url= http://www.iwallerstein.com/about/|access-date= 27 February 2014}}</ref>

Between 2000 and his death in 2019 Wallerstein worked as a Senior Research Scholar at [[Yale University]].<ref>Ed. Parker, Noel and Stuart Sim. 1997. "Wallerstein, Immanuel (1930– )." Pp. 372–76 in The AZ Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists.

==Theory==
Wallerstein began as an expert on [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] African affairs, which he selected as the focus of his studies after attending international youth conferences in 1951 and 1952.<ref>Wallerstein, I. 2000. ''The Essential Wallerstein''. New York, NY: The New Press.</ref> His publications focused almost exclusively on this topic until the early 1970s, when he began to distinguish himself as a historian and theorist of the global [[capitalism |capitalist]] [[economy]] on a macroscopic level. His early criticism of global capitalism and championship of "anti-systemic movements" made him an ''[[éminence grise]]'' with the [[anti-globalization movement]] within and outside of the academic community, along with [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928- ) and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930-2002).

Wallerstein's most important work, ''The Modern World-System'', appeared in four volumes between 1974 and 2011.<ref>Williams, Gregory. P. 2013. Special Contribution: Interview with Immanuel Wallerstein Retrospective on the Origins of World-Systems Analysis. ''Journal of World-Systems Research'' 19(2): 202–210.</ref> In it, Wallerstein drew on several intellectual influences. From [[Karl Marx]], Wallerstein took the underlying emphasis on economic factors and their dominance over ideological factors in [[global politics]]; and such ideas as the dichotomy between [[Capital (economics) |capital]] and labor; while criticizing the traditional Marxian view of world economic development through stages such as [[feudalism]] and capitalism, and while criticizing as well its account of the process of [[Capital accumulation| accumulation of capital]], and of dialectics. From [[dependency theory]], he took the key concepts of "core" and "periphery".

However, Wallerstein named [[Frantz Fanon]] (1925-1961), [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902-1985), and [[Ilya Prigogine]] (1917-2003) as the three individuals who exerted the greatest influence "in modifying my line of argument (as opposed to deepening a parallel line of argument)."<ref name=Wall2000/> In ''The Essential Wallerstein'', he stated that: "Fanon represented for me the expression of the insistence by those disenfranchised by the modern world‑system that they have a voice, a vision, and a claim not merely to justice but to intellectual valuation.";<ref name=Wall2000/> that Braudel, for his description of the development and political implications of extensive networks of economic exchange in the European world between 1400 and 1800, "more than anyone else made me conscious of the central importance of the social construction of time and space and its impact on our analyses.";<ref name=Wall2000/> and that "Prigogine forced me to face the implications of a world in which certainties did not exist – but knowledge still did."<ref name=Wall2000/>

Wallerstein also stated that another major influence on his work was the [[Protests of 1968 | "world revolution" of 1968]]. A member of the faculty of Columbia University at the time of the student protests, he participated in a faculty committee that attempted to resolve the dispute. He argued in several works that this revolution marked the end of "[[liberalism]]" as a viable ideology in the modern world system. He also argued that the end of the [[Cold War]], rather than marking a triumph for liberalism, indicates that the current system has entered its 'end' phase: a period of crisis that will end only when it is replaced by another system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Globalization of World Politics |last=Baylis|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-956909-0}}</ref> Wallerstein anticipated the growing importance of the [[North–South divide in the World|North–South divide]] at a time when the main world conflict was the [[Cold War]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Wallerstein was often mocked for arguing since 1980 that the United States is a "[[Hegemony|hegemon]] in decline",{{citation needed | date=December 2015}} but since the [[Iraq War]] this argument has become more widespread. During this time, Wallerstein also argued that the development of the capitalist world economy was detrimental to a large proportion of the world's population.<ref name=PH>Paul Halsall [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/wallerstein.html Modern History Sourcebook: Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory], August 1997</ref> Like Marx, Wallerstein predicted that capitalism will be replaced by a [[Socialism|socialist]] economy, a view held in the 1970s, but reassessed in the 1980s.<ref name=CAMV>Carlos A. Martínez-Vela, [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/WorldSystem.pdf World Systems Theory], paper prepared for the [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/NewNotebook.htm Research Seminar in Engineering Systems], November 2003</ref> He concluded that the successor system(s) is unknowable.

Wallerstein both participated in and wrote about the [[World Social Forum]].

===''The Modern World-System''===
[[File:Wallerstein's Core-periphery model.png|thumb|A model of a core-periphery system like that used by Wallerstein.]]
Wallerstein's first volume on world-systems theory (''The Modern World System'', 1974) was predominantly written during a year at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] (now affiliated with [[Stanford University]]).<ref name=Wall97/> In it, he argues that the modern world system is distinguished from [[empire]]s by its reliance on economic control of the world order by a dominating capitalist center ([[Core countries|core]]) in systemic economic and political relation to [[Periphery countries|peripheral]] and [[Semi-periphery countries|semi-peripheral]] world areas.<ref>Ed. Lemert, Charles. 2010. “Immanuel Wallerstein.” Pp. 398–405 in ''Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classical Readings''. Westview Press.</ref>

Wallerstein rejected the notion of a "[[Third World]]", claiming that there is only one world connected by a complex network of economic exchange relationships — i.e., a "world-economy" or "world-system" in which the "dichotomy of capital and labor" and the endless "accumulation of capital" by competing agents (historically including, but not limited, to nation-states) account for frictions.<ref name=So>{{cite book|last1=So|first1=Alvin Y.|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|date=1990|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Newbury Park, London|pages=169–199}}</ref> This approach is known as the world-system theory.

Wallerstein located the origin of the modern world-system in 16th-century Western Europe and the Americas. An initially slight advance in capital accumulation in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], the [[Dutch Republic]], and [[France]], due to specific political circumstances at the end of the period of feudalism, set in motion a process of gradual expansion. As a result, only one global network or system of economic exchange exists in modern society. By the 19th century, virtually every area on earth was incorporated into the capitalist world-economy.

The capitalist world-system is far from homogeneous in cultural, political, and economic terms; instead, it is characterized by fundamental differences in social development, accumulation of political power, and capital. Contrary to affirmative theories of [[modernization]] and capitalism, Wallerstein did not conceive of these differences as mere residues or irregularities that can and will be overcome as the system evolves.

A lasting division of the world into ''core'', ''semi-periphery'', and ''periphery'' is an inherent feature of world-system theory. Other theories, partially drawn on by Wallerstein, leave out the semi-periphery and do not allow for a grayscale of development.<ref name=So/> Areas which have so far remained outside the reach of the world-system enter it at the stage of "periphery". There is a fundamental and institutionally stabilized "[[Division of labour|division of labor]]" between core and periphery: while the core has a high level of technological development and manufactures complex products, the role of the periphery is to supply raw materials, agricultural products, and cheap labor for the expanding agents of the core. Economic exchange between core and periphery takes place on [[unequal exchange|unequal terms]]: the periphery is forced to sell its products at low prices, but has to buy the core's products at comparatively high prices. Once established, this unequal state tends to stabilize itself due to inherent, quasi-deterministic constraints. The statuses of core and periphery are not exclusive and fixed geographically, but are relative to each other. A zone defined as "semi-periphery" acts as a periphery to the core and as a core to the periphery. At the end of the 20th century, this zone would comprise Eastern Europe, [[China]], [[Brazil]], and [[Mexico]]. It is important to note that core and peripheral zones can co-exist in the same location.

One effect of the expansion of the world-system is the [[commodification]] of things, including human labor. Natural resources, land, labor, and human relationships are gradually being stripped of their "intrinsic" value and turned into commodities in a [[Market (economics)|market]] which determines their exchange value.

In the last two decades of his life, Wallerstein increasingly focused on the intellectual foundations of the modern world-system and the pursuit of universal theories of human behavior. In addition, he showed interest in the "structures of knowledge" defined by the disciplinary division between sociology, [[anthropology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], and the [[humanities]], which he himself regarded as [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]]. In analyzing them, he was highly influenced by the "new sciences" of theorists like [[Ilya Prigogine]].

===Criticism===
Wallerstein's theory provoked harsh criticism, not only from [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] or [[Conservatism|conservative]] circles but even from some historians who say that some of his assertions may be historically incorrect. Some critics suggest that Wallerstein tended to neglect the cultural dimension of the modern world-system, arguing that there is a world system of global culture which is independent from the economic processes of capitalism;<ref>Abercrombie, Nicholas, Hill, Stephen, and Bryan Turner. 2006. Dictionary of Sociology. 6th ed. London, England: Penguin Books Ltd.</ref> this reduces it to what some call "official" ideologies of states which can then easily be revealed as mere agencies of economic interest. Nevertheless, his analytical approach, along with that of associated theorists such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]], [[Terence Hopkins]], [[Samir Amin]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], Thomas D. Hall, [[Anibal Quijano]] and [[Giovanni Arrighi]], has made a significant impact on the field and has established an institutional base devoted to the general approach of intellectual inquiry. Their ideology has also attracted strong interest from the anti-globalization movement.

[[Arthur Stinchcombe]] was very critical of Wallerstein's ''The Modern World-System'', writing that the book presents no theoretical argument and no determinate mechanisms. Instead, the theory of the book "reduces to a general imperative for the scholar to look for world system influences, perhaps wise advice but not very specific." Stinchcombe also argues that the book does not define its concepts independently of their effects, thus entailing tautologies regarding cores, peripheries and semi-peripheries.<ref>

==Terms and definitions==
===Capitalist world-system===
Wallerstein's definition follows dependency theory, which intended to combine the developments of the different societies since the 16th century in different regions into one collective development. The main characteristic of his definition is the development of a global division of labour, including the existence of independent political units (in this case, states) at the same time. There is no political center, compared to global empires like the [[Roman Empire]]; instead, the capitalist world-system is identified by the global [[market economy]]. It is divided into core, semi-periphery, and periphery regions, and is ruled by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].

===Core/periphery===
Defines the difference between developed and developing countries, characterized e.g. by power or wealth. The core refers to developed countries, the periphery to the dependent developing countries. The main reason for the position of the developed countries is economic power. Wallerstein "used the term ''core'' to suggest a multicentric region containing a group of states rather than the term ''center'' , which implies a hierarchy with a single peak."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chase-Dunn|first=Christopher|last2=Smith|first2=Jackie|last3=Manning|first3=Patrick|last4=Grubacic|first4=Andrej|date=2020-03-10|title=Remembering Immanuel Wallerstein|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5195/jwsr.2020.995|journal=Journal of World-Systems Research|volume=26|issue=1|doi=10.5195/jwsr.2020.995|issn=1076-156X}}</ref>

===Semi-periphery===
Defines states that are located between core and periphery, and who benefit from the periphery through unequal exchange relations. At the same time, the core benefits from the semi-periphery through unequal exchange relations.

===Quasi-monopolies===
Defines a kind of [[monopoly]] where there is more than one service provider for a particular good/service. Wallerstein claims that quasi-monopolies are self-liquidating because new sellers go into the market by exerting political pressure to open markets to competition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel|title=World-systems analysis : an introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/worldsystemsanal0000wall|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0822334422|edition=5. print.}}</ref>

===Kondratiev waves===
A [[Kondratiev wave]] is defined as a cyclical tendency in the world's economy. It is also known as a ''supercycle.'' Wallerstein argues that global wars are tied to Kondratiev waves. According to him, global conflicts occur as the summer phase of a wave begins, which is when production of goods and services around the world are on an upswing.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is the Kondratiev Wave?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-kondratieff-wave.htm|access-date=30 September 2012}}</ref>
