In 1761, three residents of [[Newport, Rhode Island]], drafted a petition to the colony's [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]]:<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last=Stiles|first=Ezra|url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924030935765|title=Extracts From the Itineraries and Other Miscellanies of Ezra Stiles, D.

The three petitioners were [[Ezra Stiles]], pastor of Newport's [[Clarke Street Meeting House|Second Congregational Church]] and future president of [[Yale University]]; [[William Ellery|William Ellery, Jr.]], future [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|signer]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]; and [[Josias Lyndon]], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, "This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University."<ref name=":8" /><ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], p. 25.</ref><ref name=":7" />

The [[Philadelphia]] Association of Baptist Churches were also interested in establishing a college in Rhode Island—home of [[First Baptist Church in America|the mother church of their denomination]]. At the time, the Baptists were unrepresented among the colonial colleges; the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] had [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] had the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), and the [[Church of England|Episcopalians]] had the [[College of William and Mary]] and King's College (later [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). Isaac Backus, a historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural trustee of Brown, wrote of the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:<ref name=":7" />

{{Blockquote|text=The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], who took his first degree in [[Princeton University|New-Jersey college]] in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.}}James Manning arrived at Newport in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the charter for the college. Stiles' first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that their denomination would be underrepresented in the College Board of Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in [[East Greenwich, Rhode Island|East Greenwich]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana {{!}} Charter|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0350|access-date=2021-04-10|website=www.brown.edu|archive-date=April 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411024736/https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0350|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the corporation—the college's governing body—was held in Newport's [[Old Colony House]]. Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] was chosen chancellor, former and future governor [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] vice chancellor, John Tillinghast treasurer, and Thomas Eyres secretary. The charter stipulated that the board of trustees should be composed of 22 Baptists, five [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists—including the college president—"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations."<ref name=":7" />

At the time of its creation, Brown's charter was a uniquely progressive document.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864899539|title=International Dictionary of University Histories|date=1998|others=Carol J. Summerfield, Mary Elizabeth Devine, Anthony Levi|isbn=978-1-134-26217-5|location=Chicago|pages=56|oclc=864899539}}</ref> Other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's charter asserted, "Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction." The document additionally "recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other [university charter] the principle of denominational cooperation."<ref name=":7" /> The oft-repeated statement that Brown's charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership is inaccurate; other college charters were similarly liberal in that particular.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Phillips|first=Janet M|url=https://www.brown.edu/web/documents/short-history-of-brown.pdf|title=Brown University:A Short History|date=1992|publisher=Office of University Relations, Brown University|location=Providence, RI|language=English|oclc=30582651|access-date=April 10, 2021|archive-date=January 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109150423/https://www.brown.edu/web/documents/short-history-of-brown.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1766, the college authorized [[Morgan Edwards|Rev. Morgan Edwards]] to travel to Europe to "solicit Benefactions for this Institution." During his year-and-a-half stay in the [[British Isles naming dispute|British Isles]], the reverend secured funding from benefactors including [[Thomas Penn]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].<ref name=":4" />

In 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus, [[John Brown (Rhode Island politician)|John]] and [[Moses Brown]] purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of [[Chad Brown (minister)|Chad Brown]], an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of [[Providence Plantations]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Guild|first=Reuben Aldridge|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-brown-university-with-illustrative-documents/oclc/770834|title=History of Brown University: With Illustrative Documents|date=1867|publisher=Providence Press Company, printers|pages=233|oclc=770834|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2021|archive-date=April 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210410070359/https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-brown-university-with-illustrative-documents/oclc/770834|url-status=live}}</ref> After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.

A building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as "The College Edifice" and later as [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]], may have been modeled on [[Nassau Hall]], built 14 years prior at the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]]. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his [[alma mater]].<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana {{!}} University Hall|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=U0040|access-date=2021-01-07|website=www.brown.edu|archive-date=January 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117204903/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=U0040|url-status=live}}</ref>

On September 8, 1803, the corporation voted, "That the donation of $5000 Dollars, if made to this College within one Year from the late Commencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College." The following year, the appeal was answered by College treasurer Nicholas Brown, Jr. In a letter dated September 6, 1804, Brown committed "a donation of Five Thousand Dollars to Rhode Island College, to remain in perpetuity as a fund for the establishment of a Professorship of Oratory and Belles Letters." In recognition of the gift, the corporation on the same day voted, "That this College be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown University."<ref>{{Cite book|last=University|first=Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zl-AAAAIAAJ|title=Historical Catalogue of Brown University, 1764-1914|date=1914|publisher=The University|pages=11|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2021|archive-date=October 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028221008/https://books.google.com/books?id=6zl-AAAAIAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown, Jr., totaled nearly $160,000 and included funds for building Hope College (1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834–35).

In 1904, the [[John Carter Brown Library]] was established as an independently funded research library on Brown's campus; the library's collection was founded on that of [[John Carter Brown]], son of Nicholas Brown, Jr.

The Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and accrued wealth both directly and indirectly from the [[Transatlantic Slave Trade|transatlantic slave trade]]. The family was divided on the issue of slavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].

In 2003 under the tenure of President [[Ruth Simmons]], the university established a steering committee to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to address them.<ref>Howell, Ricardo (2001, July).

==== The American Revolution ====
With British vessels patrolling [[Narragansett Bay]] in the fall of 1776, the college library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping. During the subsequent [[American Revolutionary War]], Brown's [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] was used to house French and other revolutionary troops led by General [[George Washington]] and the [[Comte de Rochambeau]] as they waited to commence the [[Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route|march of 1781]] that led to the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]]. This has been celebrated as marking the defeat of the British and end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782.<ref name=":7" />

A number of Brown's founders and alumni played roles in the American Revolution and subsequent founding of the United States. Brown's first chancellor, Stephen Hopkins, served as a delegate to the [[Albany Congress|Colonial Congress in Albany]] in 1754 and to the [[Continental Congress]] from 1774 to 1776. James Manning represented Rhode Island at the [[Congress of the Confederation]], while concurrently serving as Brown's first president.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana {{!}} Manning, James|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=M0100|access-date=2021-04-10|website=www.brown.edu|archive-date=April 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210410070356/https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=M0100|url-status=live}}</ref> Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins signed the [[Declaration of independence|Declaration of Independence]].

[[James Mitchell Varnum]], who graduated from Brown with honors in 1769, served as one of General George Washington's [[Continental Army]] [[brigadier general]]s and later as [[major general]] in command of the entire [[Rhode Island militia]]. Varnum is noted as the founder and commander of the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]], widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U.S. military history.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Evans|first=Farrell|title=America's First Black Regiment Gained Their Freedom by Fighting Against the British|url=https://www.history.com/news/first-black-regiment-american-revolution-first-rhode-island|access-date=2021-04-05|website=HISTORY|language=en|archive-date=April 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210410070356/https://www.history.com/news/first-black-regiment-american-revolution-first-rhode-island|url-status=live}}</ref> [[David Howell (jurist)|David Howell]], who graduated with an A.M. in 1769, served as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] from 1782 to 1785.

=== The New Curriculum ===
{{Main|Open Curriculum (Brown University)}}
In 1966, the first Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown was formed, involving 80 students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], and sought ways to "put students at the center of their education" and "teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/03/02/the-new-curriculum-then/|title=The New Curriculum Then|last=Leubsdorf|first=Ben|date=2005-03-02|work=Brown Daily Herald|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110005326/http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/03/02/the-new-curriculum-then/|archive-date=November 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Members of the GISP, [[Ira Magaziner]] and Elliot Maxwell published a paper of their findings entitled, "Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/papers/maxwell.php|title=Draft of a working paper for education at Brown University|author=Ira magaziner with Elliot Maxwell|publisher=Brown University Library|access-date=December 6, 2007|display-authors=etal|archive-date=October 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028221010/https://library.brown.edu/info/libweb/maxwell/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The paper made proposals for a new curriculum, including [[interdisciplinary]] freshman-year courses that would introduce "modes of thought," with instruction from faculty from different disciplines as well as for an end to letter grades. The following year Magaziner began organizing the student body to press for the reforms, organizing discussions and protests.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=1993|title=Curriculum|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Brunoniana|publisher=Brown University Library|location=Providence, Rhode Island|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0780|access-date=December 6, 2007|last=Mitchell|first=Martha|oclc=31085279|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911102040/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0780|archive-date=September 11, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1968, University President [[Ray Heffner]] established a Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy. Composed of administrators, the committee was tasked with developing specific reforms and producing recommendations. A report, produced by the committee, was presented to the faculty, which voted the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its key features included:<ref>{{Cite web|last=Skidmore|first=Lydia Defusto, Alex|date=2019-05-24|title=Open Curriculum at 50|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/05/24/open-curriculum-50/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US|archive-date=April 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210430064610/https://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/05/24/open-curriculum-50/|url-status=live}}</ref>
* Modes of Thought courses for first-year students
* The introduction of interdisciplinary courses
* The abandonment of "general education" distribution requirements
* The Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) grading option
* The ABC/No Credit grading system, which eliminated pluses, minuses, and D's; a grade of "No Credit" (equivalent to F's at other institutions) would not appear on external transcripts.

The Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements remain in place. In 2006, the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was proposed in response to concerns regarding grade inflation. The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Sheridan_Center/pubs/teachingExchange/jan2002/grade_inflat.shtml|title=Grade Inflation and the Brown Grading System: 2001–2002 Sheridan Center Research Project|work=The Teaching Exchange|publisher=Sheridan Center for Teaching, Brown University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204090048/https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Sheridan_Center/pubs/teachingExchange/jan2002/grade_inflat.shtml|archive-date=February 4, 2007|url-status=live|access-date=December 5, 2007|df=mdy}}; {{cite news|url=http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/03/15/CampusNews/Plusminus.Fails.Key.Test-1686967.shtml|title=Plus/minus fails key test: Faculty could still vote to change grading system|last=Lutts|first=Chloe|date=March 15, 2006|access-date=December 11, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328034948/http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/03/15/CampusNews/Plusminus.Fails.Key.Test-1686967.shtml|archive-date=March 28, 2009|url-status=dead|newspaper=Brown Daily Herald|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Brown's coat of arms was created in 1834.

At Convocation the central gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students; at Commencement, the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates.<ref>Mitchell, Martha. (1993). "[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=V0020 Van Wickle Gates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171141/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=V0020 |date=March 3, 2016 }}." ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''</ref> A Brown superstition holds that students who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backward is said to cancel the hex.

=== Annmary Brown Memorial ===
{{Main|Annmary Brown Memorial}}
The Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907 by the politician, Civil War veteran, and book collector General [[Rush Hawkins]], as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, a member of the Brown family. In addition to its crypt—the final repository for Brown and Hawkins—the Memorial includes works of art from Hawkins's private collection, including paintings by [[Angelica Kauffman]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Gilbert Stuart]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], [[Benjamin West]], and [[Eastman Johnson]], among others. His collection of over 450 [[Incunable|incunabula]] was relocated to the John Hay Library in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0370|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana {{!}} Annmary Brown Memorial|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2019-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123220353/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0370|archive-date=January 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Today the Memorial is home to Brown's [[Medieval studies|Medieval Studies]] and [[Renaissance studies|Renaissance Studies]] programs.

=== The Walk ===

===Pembroke campus===
[[File:Brown_University_Pembroke_campus_(crop_and_straighten).jpg|thumb|Three dormitories, Metcalf Hall (1919), Andrews Hall (1947), and Miller Hall (1910), formed the heart of Pembroke College and now serve as freshman residences]]
The [[Pembroke College in Brown University|Women's College in Brown University]], known as Pembroke College, was founded in October 1891. Upon its 1971 merger with the College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sits three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is dominated by brick architecture, largely of the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian styles]]. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910). The quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947).

East Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of [[Bryant University]]. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]], Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by {{convert|10|acre|m2}} and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wrenn|first=John|date=2021-03-18|title=Wrenn GS: College Hill's Grim Reaper|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2021/03/18/wrenn-gs-college-hills-grim-reaper/|access-date=2021-04-07|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US|archive-date=March 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210318061020/https://www.browndailyherald.com/2021/03/18/wrenn-gs-college-hills-grim-reaper/|url-status=live}}</ref> Today, the area is largely used for dormitories.

[[Thayer Street]] runs through Brown's main campus. As commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to [[Harvard Square]] or Berkeley's [[Telegraph Avenue]]. [[Wickenden Street]], in the adjacent [[Fox Point, Providence, Rhode Island|Fox Point]] neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.

Built in 1925, [[Brown Stadium]]—the home of the school's football team—is located approximately a mile and a half northeast of the university's central campus.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Geh|first1=Victoria|last2=Li|first2=Evan|last3=Puma|first3=Patrick|last4=Du|first4=Hong Sen|title=The 'inescapable' effect of off-campus athletics: How the distance to Baker has shaped Columbia's recruiting, performance, and sports culture|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/sports/2020/12/09/the-inescapable-effect-of-off-campus-athletics-how-the-distance-to-baker-has-shaped-columbias-recruiting-performance-and-sports-culture/|access-date=2021-04-07|website=Columbia Daily Spectator|archive-date=June 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620212336/https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2020/12/09/the-inescapable-effect-of-off-campus-athletics-how-the-distance-to-baker-has-shaped-columbias-recruiting-performance-and-sports-culture/|url-status=live}}</ref> Marston Boathouse, the home of Brown's crew teams, lies on the [[Seekonk River]], to the southeast of campus.

===Brown and RISD===
[[File:List_Art_Center,_Brown_University.jpg|thumb|The List Art Center, built 1969–71, designed by [[Philip Johnson]], houses Brown's Department of Visual Art and the David Winton Bell Gallery]]
Since its 1893 relocation to College Hill, [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD) has bordered Brown to its west. Since 1900, Brown and RISD students have been able to cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD to count towards their Brown degree.<ref>{{Cite book|last=University|first=Brown|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Annual_Report_of_the_President_to_the_Co/dvzOAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1|title=Annual Report of the President to the Corporation of Brown University|date=1900|publisher=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|access-date=January 17, 2021|archive-date=October 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028221010/https://www.google.com/gen_204?s=web&t=aft&atyp=csi&ei=wB97Yf7_Oc3L0PEPp62a6AU&rt=wsrt.180,aft.1401,prt.964&imn=17&ima=14&imad=14&aftp=14235&bl=VsEN|url-status=live}}</ref> The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.

==== Brown|RISD Dual Degree Program ====
After several years of discussion between the two institutions and several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|title=07-013 (Brown/RISD Joint Degree)|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2018-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818025835/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|archive-date=August 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> The Brown|RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 20 of the 725 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2020, for an acceptance rate of 2.7%.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kubzansky|first=Will|date=2020-03-26|title=Brown admits 6.9 percent of applicants amid COVID-19 crisis|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/03/26/brown-admits-6-9-percent-applicants-amid-covid-19-crisis/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US|archive-date=April 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414161011/https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/03/26/brown-admits-6-9-percent-applicants-amid-covid-19-crisis/|url-status=live}}</ref> The program combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with Brown's academic offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown|RISD joint committee.
[[File:Granoff_Center_(Brown).jpg|thumb|The [[Perry and Marty Granoff Center for the Creative Arts|Granoff Center]], designed by [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]]<nowiki>, hosts the annual Brown|RISD Dual Degree exhibition</nowiki>]]
Admitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum, while taking up to three Brown classes. The second year is spent in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual "BRDD Exhibition" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the wider world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.

==== MADE Program ====
In 2020, the two schools announced the establishment of a new joint Master of Arts in design engineering program. Abbreviated as MADE, the program intends to combine RISD's programs in industrial design with Brown's programs in engineering. The program is administered through Brown's School of Engineering and RISD's Architecture and Design Division.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Li|first=Aubrey|date=2020-11-04|title=Brown collaborates with RISD to create new joint master's program|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/11/04/brown-collaborates-risd-create-new-joint-masters-program/|access-date=2021-04-10|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US|archive-date=April 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411024735/https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/11/04/brown-collaborates-risd-create-new-joint-masters-program/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Writing programs===
Writing at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, electronic writing, mixed media, and the undergraduate writing proficiency requirement—is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty that has long included nationally and internationally known authors. The undergraduate concentration in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department, and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.

===Computer science===
[[File:Computing_Laboratory,_Brown_University_(cropped).jpg|thumb|The Brown Computing Laboratory, designed by [[Philip Johnson]]]]
Brown began offering computer science courses through the departments of Economics and Applied Mathematics in 1956 when it acquired an IBM machine. Brown added an [[IBM 650]] in January 1958, the only one of its type between Hartford and Boston. In 1960, Brown opened its first dedicated computer building. The facility, designed by [[Philip Johnson]], received an [[IBM 7070]] computer the following year. Brown granted computer sciences full Departmental status in 1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflops standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/11/supercomputer|title=Brown, IBM Unveil Multimillion-Dollar Supercomputer - News from Brown|work=brown.edu|access-date=July 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724123003/https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/11/supercomputer|archive-date=July 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main|Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World}}
Established in 2004, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World is Brown's interdisciplinary research center for archeology and ancient studies. The institute pursues fieldwork, excavations, regional surveys, and academic study of the archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and Western Asia from the [[Levant]] to the [[Caucasus]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lader|first=Mary-Catherine|date=2004-11-18|title=University plans interdisciplinary approach for new archaeology institute|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2004/11/18/university-plans-interdisciplinary-approach-for-new-archaeology-institute/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US|archive-date=April 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411024737/https://www.browndailyherald.com/2004/11/18/university-plans-interdisciplinary-approach-for-new-archaeology-institute/|url-status=live}}</ref> The institute has a very active fieldwork profile, with faculty-led excavations and regional surveys presently in [[Petra]] (Jordan), [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (Egypt), Turkey, Sudan, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, [[Montserrat]], and Providence.

The Joukowsky Institute's faculty includes cross-appointments from the departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics, Anthropology, and History of Art and Architecture. Faculty research and publication areas include Greek and Roman art and architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean Bronze Age, and the archaeology of the [[Caucasus]]. The institute offers visiting teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships which have, in recent years, included Near Eastern Archaeology and Art, [[Classical archaeology|Classical Archaeology]] and Art, Islamic Archaeology and Art, and Archaeology and Media Studies.

'''Egyptology and Assyriology'''

Facing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the Department of Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's departments of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lutts|first=Chloe|date=2005-11-09|title=Nation's only Egyptology dept. set to expand, but details not set in stone|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/11/09/nations-only-egyptology-dept-set-to-expand-but-details-not-set-in-stone/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US}}</ref> The curricular focus is on three principal areas: [[Egyptology]], [[Assyriology]], and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisite, and include archaeology, languages, history, and Egyptian and [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian religions]], literature, and science. Students concentrating in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.

The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown's center for the study of global issues and public affairs, is one of the leading institutes of its type in the country. The institute occupies facilities designed by Uruguayan architect [[Rafael Viñoly]] and Japanese architect [[Toshiko Mori]]. The institute was initially endowed by [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]] (Class of 1937), former [[Ambassador to the Soviet Union]] and longtime president of [[IBM]].

The institute's curricular interest is organized into the principal themes of development, security, and governance—with further focuses on globalization, economic uncertainty, security threats, environmental degradation, and poverty. Six Brown undergraduate concentrations are hosted by the Watson Institute: [[Development studies|Development Studies]], International and Public Affairs, International Relations, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Middle East Studies, Public Policy, and South Asian Studies. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Master of Public Affairs (M.P.A) Program. The institute also offers postdoctoral, professional development and global outreach programming. In support of these programs, the institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its [[Casualties of the Iraq War|Costs of War Project]], first released in 2011 and continuously updated since. The project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], and [[Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Pakistan]] since 2001.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ismay|first=John|date=2020-09-08|title=At Least 37 Million People Have Been Displaced by America's War on Terror|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/magazine/displaced-war-on-terror.html|access-date=2021-04-01|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=March 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210324005536/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/magazine/displaced-war-on-terror.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Established in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest civilian engineering program in the country.{{Efn|The program was preceded by that of the [[Rensselaer Institute]] (1824) and [[Union College]] (1845)|name=|group=}} In 1916, Brown's departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a single Division of Engineering. In 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ember|first=Sydney|date=2010-07-26|title=Corporation approves engineering school at May meeting|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2010/07/26/corporation-approves-engineering-school-at-may-meeting/|access-date=2021-04-01|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US}}</ref>

Engineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The school is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools, and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences. The school practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.

===IE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program===
Since 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe; [[IE Business School]] in Madrid.

In 1827, medical instruction was suspended by President [[Francis Wayland]] after the program's faculty declined to follow a new policy requiring students to live on campus. The program was reorganized in 1972; the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students in 1975. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://med.brown.edu/timeline/ |title=History of the Brown Medical School |publisher=Med.brown.edu |access-date=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504102538/http://med.brown.edu/timeline/ |archive-date=May 4, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In January 2007, entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Warren Alpert]] donated $100 million to the school. In recognition of the gift the school's name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Brown's medical school is known especially for its eight-year [[Program in Liberal Medical Education]] (PLME), an eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program. Inaugurated in 1984, the program is one of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, offering admission to only of 2% of applicants in 2021.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Kubzansky|first=Will|date=2021-04-06|title=Brown admits record-low 5.4 percent of applicants to the class of 2025|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2021/04/06/brown-admits-record-low-5-4-percent-applicants-class-2025/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US|archive-date=April 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210406235148/https://www.browndailyherald.com/2021/04/06/brown-admits-record-low-5-4-percent-applicants-class-2025/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from [[Providence College]], [[Rhode Island College]], the [[University of Rhode Island]], and [[Tougaloo College]]. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via [[AMCAS]] like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers M.D./PhD, M.D./[[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] and M.D./[[Master of Public Policy|M.P.P.]] dual degree programs.

The students meet in Providence every 6–7 weeks for a week seminar each trimester.

The university has also invested in [[MOOC]] development starting in 2013, when two courses, ''Archeology's Dirty Little Secrets'' and ''The Fiction of Relationship'', both of which received thousands of students.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brown launches two free online courses|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2013/06/coursera|access-date=May 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514141420/https://news.brown.edu/articles/2013/06/coursera|archive-date=May 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> However, after a year of courses, the university broke its contract with [[Coursera]] and revamped its online persona and MOOC development department. By 2017, the university released new courses on [[EdX|edx]], two of which were ''The Ethics of Memory'' and ''Artful Medicine: Art's Power to Enrich Patient Care''. In January 2018, Brown published its first "game-ified" course called ''Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature'', which featured out of platform games to help learners understand materials, as well as a story-line that immerses users into a fictional world to help characters along their journey.<ref>{{citation|title=BrownX|url=https://www.edx.org/school/brownx|access-date=May 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514065004/https://www.edx.org/school/brownx|archive-date=May 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Residential and Greek societies ===
[[File:Wayland_Arch_in_the_winter.jpg|thumb|Wriston Quadrangle houses Brown's Greek organizations]]
Approximately 12 percent of Brown students participate in [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek Life]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Teng|first=Spencer Schultz, Emily|date=2020-04-06|title=Spring 2020 Herald poll reflects student perspectives, experiences|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/04/06/spring-2020-herald-poll-reflects-student-perspectives-experiences/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US|archive-date=November 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111115454/https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/04/06/spring-2020-herald-poll-reflects-student-perspectives-experiences/|url-status=live}}</ref> The university recognizes eleven Greek organizations: six fraternities ([[Alpha Phi Alpha]], Beta Omega Chi, Delta Tau, [[Delta Phi]], Kappa Alpha Psi, and Theta Alpha), four sororities ([[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Kappa Delta]], and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]],), one co-ed house ([[Zeta Delta Xi]]), and one co-ed literary society ([[Alpha Delta Phi Society|Alpha Delta Phi]]).

Since the early 1950s, all Greek organizations on campus have been located in Wriston Quadrangle.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana {{!}} Fraternities|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=F0270|access-date=2021-03-29|website=www.brown.edu|archive-date=May 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505201808/https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=F0270|url-status=live}}</ref> The organizations are overseen by the Greek Council.

An alternative to Greek-letter organizations are Brown's program houses, which are organized by themes. As with Greek houses, the residents of program houses select their new members, usually at the start of the spring semester. Examples of program houses are [[St. Anthony Hall]] (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado French/Hispanic/Latinx House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and Interfaith House.

All students not in program housing enter a lottery for general housing. Students form groups and are assigned time slots during which they can pick among the remaining housing options.

=== Societies and clubs ===
[[File:Ladd_Observatory_at_Brown.jpg|thumb|[[Ladd Observatory]], built 1890–1891, is used by Brown Space Engineering, a student group focused on [[Aerospace engineering]]]]
The earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of [[Solomon Drowne]], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771.<ref name=":7" /> The organization seems to have disappeared during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Subsequent societies include the Misokosmian Society (est. 1798 and renamed the Philermenian Society), the Philandrian Society (est. 1799), the United Brothers (1806), the Philophysian Society (1818), and the Franklin Society (1824). Societies served social as well as academic purposes, with many supporting literary debate and amassing large libraries.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana {{!}} Franklin Society|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=F0260|access-date=2021-08-06|website=www.brown.edu|archive-date=August 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210806024223/https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=F0260|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="brown.edu">{{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana {{!}} Philermenian Society|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=P0190|access-date=2021-08-06|website=www.brown.edu|archive-date=August 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210806024221/https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=P0190|url-status=live}}</ref> Older societies generally aligned with [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] while younger societies generally leaned [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].<ref name=":7" />

Societies remained popular into the 1860s, after which they were largely replaced by fraternities.<ref name="brown.edu"/>

The Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society which "tapped" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the club served as the ''de facto'' undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971, and ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.

[[Societas Domi Pacificae]], known colloquially as "Pacifica House," is a present-day, self-described secret society. It purports a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary "Franklin Society" traceable in the nineteenth century.

=== Student organizations ===
{{See also|Category:Brown University organizations}}

=== Resource centers ===
[[File:Sarah_Doyle_Womens_Center_Brown_University.jpg|thumb|The [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]]]]
Brown has several resource centers on campus. The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity.

=== Activism ===
====1968 Black Student Walkout====
On December 5 of 1968, several Black women from Pembroke College initiated a walkout in protest an atmosphere at the colleges described by Black students as a "stifling, frustrating, [and] degrading place for Black students" after feeling the colleges were non-responsive to their concerns. In total, 65 Black students participated in the walk out. Their principal demand was to increase Black student enrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match that of the proportion in the US. This ultimately resulted in a 300% increase in Black enrollment the following year, but some demands have yet to be met.<ref>{{Cite web|title=TWC History at Brown {{!}} Brown Center for Students of Color|url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/students-of-color/history|access-date=2020-09-08|website=www.brown.edu|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823234043/https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/students-of-color/history|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Podugu|first=Trisha Thacker, Katherine Bennett, Priyanka|date=2018-12-07|title=Students commemorate legacy, impact of 1968 walkout|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/12/07/students-commemorate-legacy-impact-1968-walkout/|access-date=2020-09-08|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US|archive-date=June 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210610192404/https://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/12/07/students-commemorate-legacy-impact-1968-walkout/|url-status=live}}</ref>
