==Theory==
In his best known work 'Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy' Appadurai lays out his meta theory of disjuncture. For him the ‘new global cultural economy has to be seen as a complex, overlapping, disjunctive order’.<ref>"Disjuncture and Difference", ''Modernity at Large'', 32</ref> This order is composed of different interrelated, yet disjunctive global cultural flows,<ref>Josiah McC. Heyman, Howard Campbell (2009) "The Anthropology of Global Flows:A critical reading of Appadurai's `Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy", ''Anthropological Theory(9:2) 131-148'', 133.</ref> specifically the following five:

# [[ethnoscape]]s; the migration of people across cultures and borders
# [[mediascape]]s; the variety of media that shape the way we understand our world 
# [[technoscape]]s; the scope and movement of technology (mechanical and informational) around the world
# [[financescape]]s; the worldwide flux of money and capital
# [[ideoscape]]s; the global flow of ideas and ideologies

===The social imaginary===
Appadurai articulated a view of cultural activity known as the [[imaginary (sociology)|social imaginary]], which is composed of the five dimensions of global cultural flows.

He describes his articulation of the imaginary as:
<blockquote>The image, the imagined, the imaginary – these are all terms that direct us to something critical and new in global cultural processes: the imagination as a social practice.  No longer mere fantasy (opium for the masses whose real work is somewhere else), no longer simple escape (from a world defined principally by more concrete purposes and structures), no longer elite pastime (thus not relevant to the lives of ordinary people), and no longer mere contemplation (irrelevant for new forms of desire and subjectivity), the imagination has become an organized field of social practices, a form of work (in the sense of both labor and culturally organized practice), and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility. This unleashing of the imagination links the play of pastiche (in some settings) to the terror and coercion of states and their competitors.  The imagination is now central to all forms of agency, is itself a social fact, and is the key component of the new global order.<ref>"Disjuncture and Difference", ''Modernity at Large'', 31</ref></blockquote>

Appadurai credits [[Benedict Anderson]] with developing notions of [[imagined communities]]. Some key figures who have worked on the imaginary are [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Jacques Lacan]] (who especially worked on the [[symbol]]ic, in contrast with imaginary and the real), and [[Dilip Gaonkar]]. However, Appadurai's ethnography of urban social movements in the city of Mumbai has proved to be contentious with several scholars like the Canadian anthropologist, Judith Whitehead arguing that SPARC (an organization which Appadurai espouses as an instance of progressive social activism in housing) being complicit in the World Bank's agenda for re-developing Mumbai.
