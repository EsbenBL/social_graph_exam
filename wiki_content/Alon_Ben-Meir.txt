Often accused of being overly optimistic in his views, notably concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict, Ben-Meir has responded, "There is enough pessimism, pain, and disdain, and I do not choose to add my voice to the chorus of doom.…..I envision a Middle East with Arabs and Jews working and living together to achieve greatness perhaps unknown in human experience. Together, they will usher in a renaissance that will spread its light from sea to sea."<ref>Website: Professor Alon Ben-Meir. http://www.alonben-meir.com/ "About Alon Ben-Meir: Looking Ahead" Retrieved: 15 July 2011</ref>
