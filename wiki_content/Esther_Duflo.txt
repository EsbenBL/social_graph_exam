According to the Open Syllabus Project, Duflo is the seventh most frequently cited author on college syllabi for economics courses.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://opensyllabus.org/results-list/authors?size=50&fields=Economics |title = Open Syllabus Project}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Duflo was born in 1972 in Paris, the daughter of [[pediatrician]] Violaine Duflo and mathematics professor [[Michel Duflo]]. During Duflo's childhood, her mother often participated in medical humanitarian projects.<ref name=tpl>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/05/17/the-poverty-lab|title=The Poverty Lab|work=The New Yorker|date=17 May 2010|access-date=14 October 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/81804a1a-6d08-11e1-ab1a-00144feab49a|title=Lunch with the FT: Esther Duflo|author=Gapper, John|work=Financial Times|date=17 March 2012|access-date=14 October 2019 }}</ref>

After studying in the [[Khâgne#Khâgnes de Lettres et Sciences sociales (B/L)|B/L]] program of [[Lycée Henri-IV]]'s [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|Classes préparatoires]], Duflo began her undergraduate studies at [[École normale supérieure (Paris)|École normale supérieure]] in Paris, planning to study history, her interest since childhood. In her second year, she began considering a career in the civil service or politics. She spent ten months in [[Moscow]] starting in 1993. She taught French and worked on a history thesis that described how the [[Soviet Union]] "had used the big construction sites, like the [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] tractor factory, for propaganda, and how propaganda requirements changed the actual shape of the projects." In Moscow, she also worked as a research assistant for a French economist connected to the [[Central Bank of Russia]] and, separately, for [[Jeffrey Sachs]], an American economist, who was advising the [[Russian Minister of Finance]]. The experiences at these research posts led her to conclude that "economics had potential as a lever of action in the world" and she could satisfy academic ambitions while doing "things that mattered".<ref name=tpl />

She finished her degree in history and economics at École Normale Supérieure in 1994 and received a master's degree from DELTA, now the [[Paris School of Economics]], jointly with the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS)]] of the [[Université Paris Sciences et Lettres|Université Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL)]] and the École Normale Supérieure, in 1995. Subsequently, she obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in economics at MIT in 1999, under the joint supervision of [[Abhijit Banerjee]] and [[Joshua Angrist]]. Her doctoral dissertation focused on effects of a [[natural experiment]] involving an Indonesian school-expansion program in the 1970s, and it provided conclusive evidence that in a developing country, more education resulted in higher wages.<ref name=tpl /> Upon completing her doctorate, she was appointed assistant professor of [[economics]] at MIT and has been at MIT ever since, aside from a leave at [[Princeton University]] in 2001–2002, and at the [[Paris School of Economics]] in 2007 and 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.povertyactionlab.org/duflo|title=Esther Duflo – The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab|website=www.povertyactionlab.org|access-date=14 October 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
After earning her PhD in 1999, Duflo became an assistant professor at MIT. She was promoted to associate professor (with [[Academic tenure|tenure]]) in 2002, at 29, making her among the youngest faculty members to be awarded tenure, and to full professor in 2003.<ref name="tpl" />

Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee have taken a special interest in India since 1997. In 2003, she conducted a trial experiment on teacher absenteeism in 120 schools run by a non-profit group. By encouraging the teachers to photograph themselves with their students each day, she was able to reduce their absenteeism.<ref name=tpl />

In 2003, she co-founded [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab|Poverty Action Lab]] at MIT, which has since conducted over 200 empirical development experiments and trained development practitioners to run [[randomized controlled trial]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/interview-with-esther-duflo|title=Interview with Esther Duflo|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis|date=December 2011|author=Clement, Douglas|access-date=14 October 2019 }}</ref> The lab has branches in [[Chennai]], India and at the Paris School of Economics.<ref name=erasmus /> In 2004, together with several colleagues, Duflo conducted another experiment in India. It showed that taped speeches by women were more readily accepted in villages that had experienced women leaders. Duflo became increasingly convinced that communities supporting women candidates could expect economic benefits, but she experienced difficulty in convincing her peers.<ref name=tpl /> Focused on assessing developments addressing social welfare, in 2008, she received the [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards|Frontier of Knowledge award]] for development cooperation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.povertyactionlab.org/news/bbva-foundation-frontiers-knowledge-award-given-j-pal|title=BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award Given to J-PAL|publisher=J-PAL|date=1 December 2008|access-date=14 October 2019 }}</ref><ref name="fe">{{Cite web|url=https://www.famouseconomists.net/esther-duflo|title=Esther Duflo|publisher=Famous Economists|access-date=14 October 2019}}</ref> Duflo entered the public sphere in 2013, when she sat on the new Global Development Committee, which advised former US President Barack Obama on issues regarding development aid in poor countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessfrance.fr/discover-france-news-france-s-esther-duflo-becomes-the-youngest-ever-winner-of-the-nobel-prize-in-economics#|title=France's Esther Duflo becomes the youngest ever winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics|date=16 October 2016|publisher=[[Business France]]|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref>

==Awards==
===Nobel prize in Economic Sciences===
Esther Duflo was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2019 along with her two co-researchers Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer "for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty". Duflo is the youngest person (at age 46) and the second woman to win this award (after [[Elinor Ostrom]] in 2009).<ref>{{Cite news | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Simon | last2 = Pollard | first2 = Niklas | title = Trio wins economics Nobel for science-based poverty fight | publisher = Reuters | date = 14 October 2019 | url = https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1WT17L-OCATP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-esther-duflo-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-economics-heres-the-uphill-battle-women-face-in-the-field-2019-10-14|title=As Esther Duflo wins the Nobel Prize in economics, here's the uphill battle women face in the field|last=Jagannathan|first=Meera|website=[[MarketWatch]]|language=en-US|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/2019/10/14/nobel-prize-economics-winner-woman-esther-duflo/|title=Meet Esther Duflo, the Second Woman Ever to Win the Nobel Prize in Economics|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref>

The press release from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] noted: "Their experimental research methods now entirely dominate [[development economics]]."<ref name=NobelWeb>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2019/10/press-economicsciences2019.pdf|title=The Prize in Economic Sciences 2019|publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: Nobel prize|date=14 October 2019|access-date=14 October 2019 }}</ref><ref name=guardianlive>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/oct/14/nobel-prize-in-economic-sciences-2019-sveriges-riksbank-live-updates|title=Nobel Prize in Economics won by Banerjee, Duflo and Kremer for fighting poverty|work=The Guardian|date=14 October 2019}}</ref> The Nobel committee commented:
::"Banerjee, Duflo and their co-authors concluded that students appeared to learn nothing from additional days at school. Neither did spending on textbooks seem to boost learning, even though the schools in Kenya lacked many essential inputs. Moreover, in the Indian context Banerjee and Duflo intended to study, many children appeared to learn little: in results from field tests in the city of [[Vadodara]] fewer than one in five third-grade students could correctly answer first-grade curriculum math test questions.<ref name=guardianlive />

::"In response to such findings, Banerjee, Duflo and co-authors argued that efforts to get more children into school must be complemented by reforms to improve school quality."<ref name=guardianlive />

Responding by telephone to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Duflo explained that she received the prize "at an extremely opportune and important time" and hoped that it would "inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect that they deserve, like every single human being."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timescolonist.com/sports/the-latest-duflo-humbled-to-win-economics-nobel-prize-1.23976307|title=The Latest: Duflo 'humbled' to win economics Nobel Prize|publisher=Times Colonist: The Associated Press|date=14 October 2019}}</ref> She also revealed that she wanted to use the award as a "megaphone" in her fighting efforts to tackle poverty and to improve children's education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50047238|title=Esther Duflo: 'Nobel Prize will be a megaphone'|date=15 October 2019|work=BBC|access-date=16 October 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>
