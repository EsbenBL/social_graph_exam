Seligman is best remembered for his pioneering work involving [[taxation]] and [[public finance]]. His principles for a progressive federal income tax were adopted by Congress after the passage of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]].<ref name='Wesley'>{{cite journal |last=Mitchell |first=Wesley C. |title=Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, 1861-1939 |journal=American Economic Review |year=1939 |volume=29 |number=4 |pages=911–913 |jstor=1804219 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1804219}}</ref> A prolific scholar and teacher, his students had great influence on the fiscal architecture of postcolonial nations.<ref name="Woker">{{cite journal |last=Madeleine |first=Woker |title=Edwin Seligman, initiator of global progressive public finance |journal=Journal of Global History |volume=13 |issue=3 |date=November 2018 |pages=352–373 |doi=10.1017/S1740022818000190|doi-access=free }}</ref> He served as an influential founding member of the American Economics Association.<ref name='Wesley'/>

==Early life==
Edwin Seligman was born April 25, 1861 in [[New York City]], the son of the banker [[Joseph Seligman]]. He was tutored by [[Horatio Alger]] and had a broad facility for languages.<ref name='Wesley'/>

Seligman attended [[Columbia University]] at fourteen and graduated in 1879 with an [[Bachelor's degree|A.B.]].<ref name='Wesley'/><ref name=HDPE>Leon Applebaum, "Edwin R. A. Seligman," in John D. Buenker and Edward R. Kantowicz (eds.), ''Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era, 1890-1920.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1988; pp. 425-426.</ref> Seligman continued his studies in Europe, attending courses for three years at the universities of Berlin, Heidelberg, Geneva, and Paris.<ref name=EB>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson|volume=24|page=606}}</ref> He earned his [[Master's degree|M.A.]] and [[LL.B.]] degrees in 1885 and successfully defended a [[Ph.D.]] in 1885.<ref name=HDPE /> He later was awarded a [[LL.D.]] in 1904.

==Career==
Seligman spent his entire academic career at Columbia University, first joining as a lecturer in 1885.<ref name=HDPE /> He was made an [[adjunct professor]] of [[political economy]] in 1888.<ref name=EB /> He became the first [[McVickar Professor of Political Economy]] at the same university in 1904, a position which he occupied until 1931.<ref name=HDPE />

Seligman's academic work dealt largely with matters of taxation and public finance, and he was regarded as a leading proponent of the [[progressive taxation|progressive]] [[income tax]].<ref name= Mehrotra>Ajay K. Mehrotra, Making the Modern American Fiscal State: Law, Politics, and the Rise of Progressive Taxation, 1877-1929. Cambridge Historical Studies in American Law and Society. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013.</ref><ref name=HDPE /> He also taught courses at Columbia in the field of economic history.<ref name=HDPE />

From 1886 Seligman was one of the editors of the ''[[Political Science Quarterly]].'' He also edited Columbia's series in history, economics, and public law from 1890.

Seligman was a founder of the [[American Economic Association]] and served as president of that organization from 1902 to 1904.<ref name=HDPE /> He was also a key figure behind the formation of the [[American Association of University Professors]], serving as that group's president from 1919 to 1920.<ref name=HDPE />

Seligman dedicated a great deal of effort to the question of public finance during [[World War I]] and was a prominent advocate of the establishment of a progressive income tax as a basis for the funding of government operations.

Although a proponent of the [[historical materialism|economic interpretation of history]], commonly associated with [[Marxism]], Seligman was an opponent of [[socialism]] and appeared in public debates opposing prominent radical figures during the early 1920s, including such figures as [[Scott Nearing]] and [[Harry Waton]].<ref>See the published stenograms of debates with Nearing (1921) and Waton (1922).</ref>

Seligman's later academic work revolved around questions of tax policy and consumer finance.

Among his students was [[B.R. Ambedkar]], the principal architect of the [[Constitution of India]].<ref name="ambedkarLetter">{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/graphics/seligmanletter.html | title=Letter from Ambedkar to Seligman | work=Columbia University | date=16 Feb 1922 | access-date=2 June 2016}}</ref>

Seligman's teaching career ended in 1931.

==Death and legacy==
Edwin Seligman died July 18, 1939. His beliefs were highly influential with [[Charles A.
