== Climate communications ==
In addition to her research on [[climate change]], Hayhoe is known for her communication around climate change and her advocacy efforts around climate action. Professor [[John Abraham (professor)|John Abraham]] has called her "perhaps the best communicator on climate change."<ref name="Banerjee" /> [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] listed her among the 100 most influential people in 2014.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/04/24/3429851/katharine-hayhoe-time-100-most-influential-people/|title=Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, Star of Showtime Climate Series, Makes TIME 100 Most Influential People List|author=Romm, Joe|authorlink=Joseph J.

Hayhoe has been very critical of Climate Deniers.  On Sep 28, 2018 she said, 
“The six stages of climate denial are: It’s not real. It’s not us. It’s not that bad. It’s too expensive to fix. Aha, here’s a great solution (that actually does nothing). And — oh no! Now it’s too late. You really should have warned us earlier.”<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-climate-change.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage What the Coronavirus Means for Climate Change] By Meehan Crist,  The New York Times, March 27, 2020</ref>

=== Outreach to Christian communities ===
In 2009, she and her husband, [[Andrew Farley (author)|Andrew Farley]], co-authored a book called ''A Climate for Change: Global Warming Facts for Faith-Based Decisions'', which outlines the ways in which climate science reflects conservative Christian beliefs.<ref>Samenow, Jason. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2014/04/24/climate-pioneers-sullivan-and-hayhoe-make-time-100-most-influential-people-list "Climate leaders Sullivan and Hayhoe make TIME 100 Most Influential People"], ''The Washington Post'', April 24, 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsci.com/article/science/meet-scientist-who-might-end-climate-culture-wars/|title=Meet The Scientist Who Might End The Climate Culture Wars|last=Gertz|first=Emily|date=July 3, 2014|website=Popular Science|language=en|access-date=October 19, 2019}}</ref> The book resulted in word-of-mouth referrals across various Christian communities, who began to invite Hayhoe to speak at Christian colleges, churches, and other conservative groups. Notably, when Hayhoe first met her husband and co-author, he was skeptical of [[global warming]], but shifted his views.<ref name=":4" /> She notes that she was able to change his mind over the course of a year and a half, with the help of data collected on a [[NASA]] website that documents rising global temperatures over time. Hayhoe has recognized that those debates with her husband sharpened her skills as a communicator engaging audiences [[climate change denial|skeptical]] of climate science.<ref name=":5" />

The effectiveness of her outreach efforts to Christian communities have been the subject of study. She delivers lectures that are rooted in scripture and focus on the benefits of collective action to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate the effects of climate change]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/work/1196718/climate-scientist-katharine-hayhoe-bridges-the-gap-between-science-and-faith/|title=The Christian climate professor bridging the gap between science and faith|last=Fessler|first=Leah|website=Quartz at Work|language=en|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref> A 2017 study tested the effectiveness of a climate lecture Hayhoe delivered to students at the predominantly evangelical school [[Houghton College]], in which she devoted time to a discussion of [[theology]]-based ethics and delivered information about climate change through a lens of evangelical tradition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/aug/28/study-katharine-hayhoe-is-successfully-convincing-doubtful-evangelicals-about-climate-change|title=Study: Katharine Hayhoe is successfully convincing doubtful evangelicals about climate change {{!}} Dana Nuccitelli|last=Nuccitelli|first=Dana|date=August 28, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 20, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Following her lecture, students exhibited more willingness to accept that [[global warming]] is a true phenomenon and had an increased awareness of the expert scientific consensus. In an interview with [[ThinkProgress]], Hayhoe notes: "When we tie that to our Christian values there’s no conflict. In fact, quite the opposite — our faith demands that we act on this issue."<ref name=":5" />

=== Television and video ===
In 2014, Hayhoe served as a science advisor to the documentary TV series ''[[Years of Living Dangerously]]'', an [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series that details how [[climate change]] has already impacted lives around the world. She was featured in the first episode of the series, meeting with actor [[Don Cheadle]] to discuss why she believed her Christian faith and her belief in the need to act on climate were not at odds.<ref name=":0" />

Hayhoe also hosted and produced a bi-weekly web series with [[PBS]] called ''Global Weirding: Climate, Politics, and Religion'', which launched September 2016 and ran through March 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Global Weirding {{!}} PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/show/global-weirding/|language=en|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/technology/2016/11/dr-katharine-hayhoe-presents-global-weirding.html|title=What Is Global Weirding?|last=Plait|first=Phil|date=November 1, 2016|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>

===Newt Gingrich book===
Hayhoe wrote a chapter of a book by [[Newt Gingrich]] about climate change in 2009, and, in 2011, was told by Gingrich's co-author, Terry Maple, that it had been accepted.<ref name="Grist">{{cite magazine |url=http://grist.org/climate-change/chatting-with-newts-dissed-evangelical-climate-expert |title=Chatting with the climate scientist Newt dissed |last=Roberts |first=David |date=January 17, 2012 |magazine=[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]] |access-date=January 31, 2014}}</ref> Gingrich announced in late 2011 that this chapter was dropped on his request, saying, "We didn't know that they were doing that, and we told them to kill it."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/01/newt-dumps-leading-climate-scientist |title=Newt Dumps Christian Climate Scientist |last=Sheppard |first=Kate |date=January 6, 2012 |magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |publisher=Foundation for National Progress |access-date=September 8, 2013}}</ref>

Upon finding out that her chapter had been dropped, Hayhoe stated, "I had not heard that" and tweeted that she had spent over 100 unpaid hours working on the chapter.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57350372-503544/gingrich-kills-chapter-on-climate-change-in-upcoming-book|title=Gingrich kills chapter on climate change in upcoming book |last=Huisenga |first=Sarah |date=December 30, 2011 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |access-date=September 8, 2013}}</ref> Some have speculated that Gingrich dropped her chapter because [[Marc Morano]], who is not a scientist, wrote many articles on his website, ''Climate Depot'', attacking her findings.<ref name="Grist" /> This, as well as her appearing on [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s TV show, led to her receiving nearly 200 hate-mail messages the following day.<ref name="TheGlobeandMail" /><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Dawson |first=Bill |date=January 30, 2012 |title=Texas Tech Scientist Sees Intimidation Effort Behind Barrage of Hate Mail |url=http://texasclimatenews.org/wp/?p=4153|url-status=dead |publisher=Huston Advanced Research Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830122148/http://texasclimatenews.org/wp/?p=4153 |archive-date=August 30, 2013 |access-date=September 8, 2013 |magazine=Texas Climate News}}</ref> Shortly after, the conservative [[Political action committee|PAC]] [[American Tradition Partnership|American Tradition Institute]] filed a request under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] for Hayhoe's public university employer to  release her notes and emails related to the writing of the unpublished chapter for the Gingrich book.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Clynes |first=Tom |url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-06/battle-over-climate-change |title=The Battle Over Climate Science |magazine=[[Popular Science]] |date=June 21, 2012 |access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref>
