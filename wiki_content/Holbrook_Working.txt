'''Holbrook Working''' (February 5, 1895 – October 5, 1985) was an American professor of [[economics]] and [[statistics]] at [[Stanford University]]'s Food Research Institute known for his contributions on [[hedge (finance)|hedging]], on the theory of [[Futures contract|futures]] prices, on an early theory of [[market maker]] behavior,<ref>[http://business.kent.edu/erf/Papers/1954/s54-09.pdf Price Effects of Scalping and Daytrading] Proceedings of the Symposium on Futures Markets and the Public Interest, Chicago, 1954, accessed 4/24/07.</ref> and on the [[theory of storage]] (including the ''Working curve'' which plots the difference between short term and long term grain futures prices against current inventory).<ref>[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/working.htm The Working Brothers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201211458/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/working.htm |date=2005-12-01 }} History of Economic Thought, accessed 4/24/07</ref><ref>Working, H. 1933, "Price Relations between July and September Wheat Futures at Chicago Since 1885", Wheat Studies of the Food Research Institute</ref>

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], on February 5, 1895.

Working earned his Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1921. He taught at [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Minnesota]] before he joined Stanford's Food Research Institute in 1925. His younger brother [[Elmer Working]] made a major contribution on the [[parameter identification problem|identification problem for demand curves]] in econometrics, with which Holbrook Working was also involved.

Working disagreed with [[Keynes]]'s [[backwardation]] theory of futures prices, which argued that short hedgers (farmers) drive down futures prices because of their demand for ''price insurance''. Working argued that there could be hedgers on both sides of the market and that hedging was essentially not a risk reduction technique, but "speculation in the basis" which allows informed traders and commodity dealers to profit from their knowledge of future changes in the difference between futures and spot prices.

He was a founding member of the [[Econometric Society]] and was elected a Fellow of the American Agricultural Economics Association, the [[American Statistical Association]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].<ref>[http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/WorkingH.pdf Stanford Historical Society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916235517/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/WorkingH.pdf |date=2006-09-16 }} accessed 4/24/07.</ref>  In 1981 he was awarded the [[Wilks Memorial Award]] by the American Statistical Association.

He died on October 5, 1985, in [[Santa Clara, California]].
