'''John Gilbert Layton''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|MSC}} (July 18, 1950 – August 22, 2011) was a Canadian politician who served as the leader of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) from 2003 to 2011 and [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Official Opposition]] in 2011. He previously sat on [[Toronto City Council]], occasionally holding the title of acting mayor or deputy mayor of [[Toronto]] during his tenure as city councillor.<ref>{{cite web|author-link=[[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]]|title=Former City Councillor Jack Layton|url=http://www.toronto.ca/toronto_history/councillors/2001-2003/layton1.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019055703/http://www.toronto.ca/toronto_history/councillors/2001-2003/layton1.htm|archive-date=October 19, 2013|access-date=March 24, 2011|website=[[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]]}}</ref> Layton was the [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Toronto—Danforth]] from [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004]] until his death.

The son of a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] cabinet minister, Layton was raised in [[Hudson, Quebec]]. He rose to prominence in Toronto municipal politics, where he was one of the most prominent [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] voices on the city and [[Metropolitan Toronto]] councils, championing many progressive causes. [[1991 Toronto municipal election|In 1991]], he ran for mayor, losing to [[June Rowlands]]. Returning to council, he rose to become head of the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]]. In 2003, he was elected leader of the NDP on the first ballot of [[2003 New Democratic Party leadership election|the convention]].

Under his leadership, support for the NDP increased in each election. The party's popular vote almost doubled in the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 election]], which gave the NDP the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in [[Paul Martin]]'s [[minority government]]. In May 2005 the NDP supported the [[2005 Canadian federal budget|Liberal budget]] in exchange for major amendments, in what was promoted as Canada's "First NDP budget".<ref>{{Cite document |title=Good for Canada, Layton declares; Commons backs 'first NDP budget' |last=Campion-Smith |first=Bruce |date=May 20, 2005 |page=A6|id = {{ProQuest|438826726}}}}</ref> In November of that year, Layton voted with other opposition parties to defeat the Liberal government over the findings of the [[Gomery Commission]]. The NDP saw further gains in the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] and [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 elections]], in which the party elected 29 and 37 MPs, respectively.

In the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 election]] Layton led the NDP to the most successful result in the party's history, winning 103 seats—enough to form the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/ndp-won-canadians-hearts-votes-broke-liberals-bloc-222048905.html |title=How NDP won the Canadians' hearts and votes and broke the Liberals and Bloc |last=The Canadian Press |publisher=Yahoo!

Layton died on August 22, 2011, after being diagnosed with cancer. He was survived by his wife of 23 years, fellow [[Toronto]] MP [[Olivia Chow]]. Details of the type and spread of the cancer, and the exact cause of death, were not released to the public.

Shortly before he died, Layton had nominated [[Nycole Turmel]] as interim leader of the NDP and, consequently, of the Official Opposition. [[Tom Mulcair]] won the [[2012 New Democratic Party leadership election|NDP leadership contest]] to replace Layton.

==Early life and education==
Layton was born in [[Montreal]] and raised in nearby [[Hudson, Quebec]], a largely [[English Canada|Anglophone]] community.<ref>Wallace, James. "Man of the people: Jack Layton is a pragmatist waiting to be given a chance." ''[[Sudbury Star]]''. January 9, 2006, p. A8.</ref> His parents were Doris Elizabeth (née Steeves), a grand-niece of [[William Steeves]], a [[Fathers of Confederation|Father of Confederation]], and Progressive Conservative MP [[Robert Layton (politician)|Robert Layton]]. He was the grandson of [[Gilbert Layton]], who served as a minister without portfolio the government of Quebec's [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]]. He was elected student council president of his high school, Hudson High School, and his yearbook predicted that he would become a politician;<ref>Taber, Jane. "Outside House, Layton learns pecking order." ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. February 1, 2003, p. A5.</ref> he would later also credit [[Billy Bryans]], who went on to become a prominent musician with the band [[The Parachute Club]], for having played a role in his student council victory.<ref name="Death announced">{{cite news|title=Parachute Club's Billy Bryans dies at 62|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/04/23/obit-bryans-billy-parachute-club.html|access-date=April 23, 2012|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=April 23, 2012|location=Toronto}}</ref> He graduated from [[McGill University]] in 1970 with an honours [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) in [[political science]] and became a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity.

In 1969–70, he was the prime minister of the [[Parlement Jeunesse du Québec|Quebec Youth Parliament]].<ref name=ValpeObit>{{cite news|last=Valpe |first=Michael |title=Jack Layton brought inspirational politics to a cynical age |url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jack-layton-brought-inspirational-politics-to-a-cynical-age/article2137539/singlepage/ |access-date=August 26, 2011 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=August 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61BPHAGUj?url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jack-layton-brought-inspirational-politics-to-a-cynical-age/article2137539/singlepage/ |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |location=Toronto |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Layton credited a professor at McGill, the political philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], with being the primary influence in his decision to switch from a science degree to an arts degree. Moreover, it was on Taylor's advice that he pursued his doctorate at University of Toronto to study under political philosopher [[C. B. Macpherson]].

In what is perhaps Layton's most complete articulation of his political philosophy, a foreword he wrote for ''Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom'', he explains that, "The idealist current holds that human society has the potential to achieve liberty when people work together to form a society in which equality means more than negative liberty, the absolute and protected right to run races against each other to determine winners. Idealists imagine a positive liberty that enables us to build together toward common objectives that fulfill and even surpass our individual goals."<ref>Meynell, Robert. ''Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom''. Montreal-Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2011, xi – xii.</ref> Upon reading ''Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom'', Layton came to understand himself as part of the intellectual tradition of [[Canadian Idealism|Canadian Idealists]].

In 1970, the family moved to Toronto, where Layton graduated the following year from [[York University]] with a [[Master of Arts]] (MA) in [[political science]];<ref name=ValpeObit/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Timeline: Jack Layton's life|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/146960/timeline-jack-laytons-life/|access-date=2021-04-19|website=Global News|language=en-US}}</ref> and later in 1983, he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in political science at York.<ref>O'Neil, Peter (January 24, 2003). "Can Layton succeed?", ''[[Sudbury Star]]'', p. A9.</ref> In 1974, Layton became a professor at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now [[Ryerson University]]).<ref>"Grading the candidates What are the educational qualifications of the candidates for mayor of Toronto?" ''Toronto Star'' September 29, 1991, p. A3.</ref> Over the next decade, he taught at Ryerson, York, and University of Toronto. He also became a prominent activist for a variety of causes. He wrote several books, including ''Homelessness: The Making and Unmaking of a Crisis'' and a book on general public policy, ''Speaking Out''.<ref name=ValpeObit/>

Jack Layton's grandfather, [[Gilbert Layton]], was a [[Executive Council of Quebec|Quebec Cabinet]] minister in the ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'' government of [[Maurice Duplessis]], and resigned due to the provincial government's lack of support for [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Canadian participation]] in World War II. His father, [[Robert Layton (politician)|Robert Layton]], was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] activist in the 1960s and 1970s, and served as a Progressive Conservative member of Parliament and [[Cabinet of Canada|federal Cabinet]] minister in the 1980s under Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]].<ref name=Familyties>{{cite news|last=Galloway|first=Gloria|title=Behind the scenes: A look at leaders' family ties|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=December 21, 2005|location=Toronto|page=A7}}</ref>

Layton was raised as a member of the [[United Church of Canada]], and was a member of the [[Bloor Street United Church]] parish in Toronto.<ref name=unitedchurch>[http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2011/08/25/jack-layton-inspired-by-united-church-spirituality-and-ethics/ "Jack Layton inspired by United Church spirituality and ethics"]. ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', August 25, 2011.</ref> However, he also sometimes attended services at the [[Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto]], whose pastor, [[Brent Hawkes]], was a longtime NDP activist and a personal friend of Layton's.<ref name=unitedchurch />
[[File:Jack-Layton-Star-Trek-Uniform.jpg|upright|thumb|Layton wearing a custom-made uniform at a ''Star Trek'' convention in 1991]]
In 1969, at age 19, Jack married his high school sweetheart Sally Halford, with whom he had two children: [[Mike Layton|Mike]], currently a [[Toronto City Council]]lor, and Sarah, currently a senior staffer for the [[Stephen Lewis Foundation]].<ref>Geddes, John. "Jack Layton." ''[[Maclean's]]''. December 5, 2005.</ref> Layton and Halford's marriage ended in divorce in 1983 after 14 years.

Layton first met [[Olivia Chow]] in 1985 during an [[auction]] at Village by the Grange, in which Jack was the auctioneer and Olivia was the [[interpreter]] for the [[Cantonese|Cantonese language]] observers. They had been previously acquainted, however they realized that they were both candidates in the upcoming election and decided to have [[lunch]] together to talk about the campaign. Three weeks after the auction, they went on their first date. Olivia's mother did not approve of Jack at first, because of his [[race (human classification)|race]] as well as him not being a [[lawyer]] or [[Physician|doctor]]. Jack was invited to [[dinner]] at the home of Olivia's mother, where they also played [[mahjong]]. After the dinner, Jack attempted to thank Olivia's mother in [[Cantonese]], however Jack's incorrect [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] had him inadvertently saying, "Thank you for the good sex." Layton stated "My faux pas broke the ice completely. We've been good buddies ever since."<ref name=JackLovesOlivia>{{cite news|last=Rushowy |first=Kristin |title=Jack and Olivia their love story |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1043197--jack-and-olivia-their-love-story#article |access-date=August 26, 2011 |newspaper=The Toronto Star |date=January 3, 1999 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61EAHBbDO?url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1043197--jack-and-olivia-their-love-story |archive-date=August 26, 2011 |location=Toronto |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Layton was known for playing music and singing songs at party gatherings. [[Alberta]] [[Alberta New Democratic Party|NDP]] leader [[Brian Mason]] remembered during the three-day board meetings when Layton was running for president of the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]]: "He would gather people together in his hotel room and play the guitar and get everybody singing old [[Folk music|folk songs]] from the 1960s. He just got people involved, just with his personality, not politics."<ref name=Edjournaltributes>{{cite news|last=Kleiss |first=Karen |title=Alberta leaders put away partisan politics to honour Layton: Tributes pour in from across the province |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/Tributes+indicate+Jack+Layton+legacy+transcends+party+lines/5289309/story.html |access-date=August 26, 2011 |newspaper=The Edmonton Journal |date=August 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61EAopjYr?url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Tributes%20indicate%20Jack%20Layton%20legacy%20transcends%20party%20lines/5289309/story.html |archive-date=August 26, 2011 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Layton was a keen [[Trekkie]], having a custom [[Starfleet]] uniform made by a tailor. Layton was famously photographed wearing his uniform at a [[Star Trek convention]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|last=Delacourt |first=Susan |title=Where no NDP leader has gone before |url=http://thestar.blogs.com/politics/2009/05/where-no-ndp-leader-has-gone-before.html |date=May 6, 2009 |newspaper=The Toronto Star |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61ELNC9R5?url=http://thestar.blogs.com/politics/2009/05/where-no-ndp-leader-has-gone-before.html |archive-date=August 26, 2011 |access-date=August 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

At the 2005 [[Parliamentary Press Gallery]] Dinner (typically a satirical event), Layton sent up himself and his party, playing guitar and singing three songs: "Party for Sale or Rent" (to the tune of "[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]"), a re-worked version of "[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]" with different humorous lyrics, and "If I Had Another $4.6 Billion".<ref name="CBCobit">{{cite news|last=Fitzpatrick |first=Meagan |title=OBITUARY: Jack Layton's legacy as a fighter |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2011/08/22/pol-layton-death.html |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=August 22, 2011 |access-date=August 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61EMCoeGy?url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2011/08/22/pol-layton-death.html |archive-date=August 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Layton- Party For Sale or Rent|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl0Mk1idNXg|work=YouTube|publisher=YouTube, LLC|access-date=August 23, 2011}}</ref>

==Toronto City Council==
At York and Ryerson, Layton developed close links with a number of Toronto figures including [[John Sewell]] and [[David Crombie]]. He was first elected to [[Toronto City Council]] in 1982, in a surprise upset against incumbent [[Gordon Chong]]. He quickly became one of the most outspoken members of council, and a leader of the left wing.<ref>Hayes, David R. "A new star rising over left field." ''The Globe and Mail''. January 8, 1983, p. F3.</ref> He was one of the most vocal opponents of the massive [[SkyDome]] project,<ref>MacLeod, Robert. "Layton urges SkyDome inquiry." ''The Globe and Mail.'' September 12, 1991, p. A11.</ref> and an early advocate for rights for AIDS patients.<ref>Monsebraaten, Laurie. "Alderman proposes $2.1&nbsp;million AIDS team." ''Toronto Star.'' May 6, 1987, p. A6.</ref> In 1984, he was fined for trespassing when he handed out leaflets at the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] during a strike by [[Eaton's]] staff, but the charge was later thrown out on freedom of speech grounds.<ref>Spears, Tom. "Alderman wins appeal for handing out leaflets at Eaton's during strike." ''Toronto Star''. May 27, 1986, p. A18.</ref> Layton was also one of the few opponents to Toronto's bid for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]].<ref>James, Royson. "Failure pinned on Jack Layton, poverty group." ''Toronto Star''. September 19, 1990, p. A3.</ref> In 1985, he moved to the Metropolitan Toronto Council, in the first direct elections for members of that body.<ref>Smith, Michael. "Toronto Aldermen gearing up for first direct Metro election." ''Toronto Star.'' July 16, 1985, p. A6.</ref><ref>"Layton proved right." ''The Globe and Mail''. November 13, 1985, p. A17.</ref> In the 1988 municipal elections, Layton traded places with city council ally Dale Martin, with Martin going to Metro and Layton returning to Toronto City Council. Layton was easily elected in a contest with former high school teacher Lois MacMillan-Walker. The election was a major victory for Layton as the reformist coalition of which he was the ''de facto'' head gained control of city council, the first time in city history a coalition of New Democrats and independents controlled council.<ref>Monsebraaten, Laurie. "Reformers on council seek Toronto's 'rebirth.'" ''Toronto Star''. November 19, 1988, p. D1.</ref>

On July 9, 1988, he married Hong Kong-born [[Toronto District School Board]] trustee [[Olivia Chow]] in a ceremony on [[Toronto Islands|Algonquin Island]].<ref>Spears, Tom. "Busy trustee keeps to a hectic schedule." ''Toronto Star''. July 10, 1988, p. A10.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postcity.com/Post-City-Magazines/May-2010/The-biggest-fight-of-their-marriage|title=The biggest fight of their marriage – Post City Magazines|publisher=Postcity.com|date=July 9, 1988|access-date=May 2, 2011}}</ref> Their whitewater rafting honeymoon plans had to be abandoned, however, when days before the wedding Layton collided with a newspaper box while bicycling.<ref>"Layton Sues for Bike Mishap that 'Ruined' his Honeymoon". ''Toronto Star''. July 5, 1988, p. A7.</ref> Chow later joined Layton on the Toronto City Council. She has been a candidate for the federal New Democrats five times, first winning her seat the third time in a close race against [[Tony Ianno]] in the 2006 Canadian election, and re-elected in 2008 and 2011. Chow resigned from federal politics in 2014 to [[2014 Toronto mayoral election|run for mayor of Toronto]]; she placed third.

Layton and Chow were also the subject of some dispute when a June 14, 1990, ''[[Toronto Star]]'' article by Tom Kerr accused them of unfairly living in a [[housing cooperative]] subsidized by the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], despite their high income.<ref>Kerr, Tom. "Well-to-do Layton lives in 'affordable co-op'". ''Toronto Star''. June 14, 1990, p. A1.</ref> Layton and Chow had both lived in the Hazelburn co-op since 1985, and lived together in an $800 per month three-bedroom apartment after their marriage in 1988. By 1990, their combined annual income was $120,000, and in March of that year they began voluntarily paying an additional $325 per month to offset their share of the co-op's [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] subsidy, the only members of the co-op to do so. In response to the article, the co-op's board argued that having mixed-income tenants was crucial to the success of co-ops, and that the laws deliberately set aside apartments for those willing to pay market rates, such as Layton and Chow.<ref>Kerr, Tom. "Co-op residents answer critics". Toronto Star. July 19, 1990, p. A21.</ref> During the late 1980s and early 1990s they maintained approximately 30% of their units as low income units and provided the rest at what they considered market rent. In June 1990, the city solicitor cleared the couple of any wrongdoing,<ref>Polanyi, Margaret. "Layton cleared of wrongdoing Police say councillor committed no impropriety by living in co-op." ''The Globe and Mail''. August 17, 1990, p. A8.</ref> and later that month, Layton and Chow left the co-op and bought a house in [[Chinatown, Toronto|Toronto's Chinatown]] together with Chow's mother, a move they said had been planned for some time.<ref>Duffy, Andrew. "Layton says he's moving from co-op." ''Toronto Star''. June 24, 1990, p. A3.</ref> Former Toronto mayor John Sewell later wrote in ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' that rival Toronto city councillor [[Tom Jakobek]] had given the story to Tom Kerr.<ref>Wolfe, Morris. "Sensational tabloids are enticing a suspicious public." ''The Globe and Mail''. February 4, 1992, p. D1.</ref>

Originally known for coming to council meetings in blue jeans with unkempt hair, Layton worked to change his image to run for mayor in the [[1991 Toronto municipal election|1991 civic election]]. He also started wearing contact lenses, abandoning his glasses, and traded in his blue jeans for suits.<ref>Byers, Jim. "Jack Layton's trim new look triggers rumor mill at city hall." ''Toronto Star''. February 5, 1987, p. A6.</ref> In February 1991, Layton became the first official NDP candidate for the mayoralty, pitting him against centrist incumbent [[Art Eggleton]].<ref>Lewis, David Stein. "Councillor Jack Layton's campaign to become mayor of Toronto is ..." ''Toronto Star''. February 6, 1991, p. A25.</ref> In a move that surprised many, Eggleton elected not to run again.<ref>Kerr, Tom. "Eggleton out of race for mayor." ''Toronto Star''. May 2, 1991, p. A1.</ref>

Layton was opposed by three right-of-centre candidates: [[Susan Fish]], [[June Rowlands]], and [[Betty Disero]]. Right-wing support soon coalesced around former city councillor Rowlands, preventing the internal divisions Layton needed to win office.<ref>Byers, Jim.

==Leader of the NDP==
Layton was elected leader of the NDP at the [[2003 New Democratic Party leadership election|party's leadership convention]] in Toronto, on January 25, 2003. Layton won on the first ballot with 53.5% of the vote, defeating [[Bill Blaikie]], [[Lorne Nystrom]], [[Joe Comartin]] and [[Pierre Ducasse]].<ref>Haight, Lana. "Layton surprises locals: Supporters 'blown away' by win over Blaikie, Nystrom; Lana Haight." ''Star – Phoenix''. January 27, 2003, p. A1.</ref> His campaign was focused on the need to reinvigorate the party, and was prominently endorsed by former NDP leader [[Ed Broadbent]].<ref>"Broadbent backs Toronto city councillor as NDP chief". ''Times – Colonist''. November 28, 2002, p. A7.</ref>

Layton did not seek election to the House of Commons by running in a by-election, as is the tradition among new party leaders without a seat. Instead, he waited until the 2004 federal election to contest the riding of Toronto—Danforth against Liberal Dennis Mills. With no seat in the House of Commons, he appointed the runner-up, longtime Winnipeg-area MP Bill Blaikie, as parliamentary leader.<ref>Paraskevas, Joe. "NDP leader goes after Grits on Day One". ''Sudbury Star''. January 28, 2003, p. A8.</ref> Although he had no parliamentary seat, Layton was noted for drawing considerable attention from the Canadian mass media.<ref>Goar, Carol. "He makes it look too effortless". ''Toronto Star''. November 5, 2003, p. A26.</ref><ref>Curry, Bill. "NDP's Layton accused of hogging the microphones." ''National Post''. February 25, 2003, p. A11.</ref> Much of his rhetoric involved attacking the policies of then Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Paul Martin as conservative, and arguing the ideology of the Liberal Party of Canada had shifted in a more right wing direction. Another focus of Layton's leadership was to focus the party's efforts on Quebec, one of the party's weaker provinces.<ref>Chung, Andrew. "Quebec a difficult hill for NDP to climb". ''Toronto Star''. April 26, 2003, p. E02.</ref> One of his opponents in the leadership race, [[Pierre Ducasse]], was the first [[French Canadian|Québécois]] to run for leader of the NDP. After the race, Layton appointed Ducasse as his Quebec lieutenant and party spokesperson.<ref>Curry, Bill. "NDP counting on Ducasse: Popular Quebecer to run in Manicouagan". ''The Gazette''. January 5, 2004, p. A10.</ref>

The result of Layton's efforts was a strong increase in the party's support. By the end of 2003, the party was polling higher than both the [[Canadian Alliance]] or the Progressive Conservatives<ref>Lunman, Kim. "NDP inching past conservatives, poll indicates." ''The Globe and Mail''. December 5, 2003, p. A4.</ref> and it was even suggested that the next election could see the NDP in place as [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]].<ref>Canton, Maria. "NDP official opposition possible, predicts prof". ''Calgary Herald''. November 16, 2003, p. A8.</ref>

===2004 election===
{{see also|Homelessness in Canada}}
During the [[2004 Canadian federal election]], controversy erupted over Layton's accusation that Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin was responsible for the deaths of homeless people because he failed to provide funding for affordable housing.<ref>Aubry, Jack. "Layton's line starts a storm." ''Times – Colonist''. May 28, 2004, p. A4.</ref> While rates of homelessness and homeless deaths increased during the eleven years of Liberal government, the link to Martin's decisions was indirect as affordable housing is a mainly provincial jurisdiction.<ref>Murphy, Barbara. ''On the street: how we created the homeless.'' Winnipeg: J. Gordon Shillingford, c2000.</ref> Layton's charge was defended by some, including the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'',<ref>Coyne, Andrew. "Layton's charge is out of order." National Post. May 29, 2004, p. A22.</ref> but most attacked it as inaccurate and [[negative campaigning]]. Moreover, the controversy consumed the campaign, overshadowing policy announcements over the next week.<ref>Curry, Bill. "Layton drops from radar during Week 2." ''Star – Phoenix''. June 5, 2004, p. A13.</ref>

Further controversy followed as Layton suggested the removal of the ''[[Clarity Act]]'', considered by some to be vital to keeping Quebec in Canada and by others as undemocratic, and promised to recognize any declaration of independence by Quebec after a referendum.<ref>Chase, Steven. "Layton would axe Clarity Act" ''The Globe and Mail''. May 29, 2004, p. A1.</ref> This position was not part of the NDP's official party policy, leading some high-profile party members, such as NDP [[House Leader|House leader]] Bill Blaikie and former NDP leader [[Alexa McDonough]], to publicly indicate that they did not share Layton's views. His position on the ''Clarity Act'' was reversed in the 2006 election to one of support.<ref>[http://archive.rabble.ca/babble/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=next_topic&f=35&t=001296&go=older Layton reverses course on Clarity Act] Rabble.ca. December 7, 2005. {{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Layton also continued his effort to improve his party's standing in Quebec. The NDP ran French-language ads in the province and Layton, who spoke colloquial [[Quebec French|Québécois French]], appeared in them. He advocated replacing the [[Plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] system with [[proportional representation]]. He threatened to use the NDP's clout in the event of a minority government. However, it was dismissed out of hand by the Liberal and [[Bloc Québécois]] leaders, as they tend to be favored by the first-past-the-post system, normally being allocated a greater proportion of seats than the proportion of votes cast for them. Historically, the NDP's popular vote does not translate into a proportional number of seats because of scattered support. This was most opposed by the Bloc Québécois, who usually had the lowest popular vote but nonetheless won many seats because their support was concentrated in Quebec. Despite these problems, Layton led the NDP to a 15% popular vote, its highest in 16 years. However, it only won 19 seats in the House of Commons, two less than the 21 won under Alexa McDonough in 1997, and far short of the 40 that Layton predicted on the eve of the election. However, some potential NDP voters may have voted Liberal to prevent a possible Conservative win. Olivia Chow and several other prominent Toronto NDP candidates lost tight races and Layton won his own seat against incumbent Liberal Dennis Mills by a much narrower margin than early polls indicated.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Liberal minority government===
[[File:Layton1.JPG|right|thumb|Jack Layton speaks at an NDP Rally in Courtenay, British Columbia the night of January 12, 2006]]
With the ruling Liberal Party being reduced to a minority government, revelations of the [[sponsorship scandal]] damaging its popularity to the point where both the Conservative Party and the Bloc Québécois were pressing their advantage for a [[snap election]], the prime minister approached the NDP for its support. Layton demanded the cancellation of proposed [[corporate tax]] cuts and called for an increase in social spending. The ensuing compromise in the NDP's favour was protested by the other opposition parties who used it as a pretext to force a [[Motion of no confidence|non-confidence vote]]. On May 19, two such votes were defeated and Layton's amendments went on to be passed on its final reading vote on June 23. As a result of this political coup and his apparent civil behaviour in a spitefully raucous parliament, many political analysts noted that Layton gained increased credibility as an effective leader of an important party, becoming the major second choice leader in many political polls – for example, polling second in Quebec after [[Gilles Duceppe]], despite the low polls for his party as a whole in the province.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In mid-November 2005, when Liberal support dropped after the [[Gomery Commission]] delivered its first report, Layton offered the prime minister several conditions in return for the NDP's continued support, most notably on the issue of [[privatization]] of [[health care in Canada]], where Layton wanted strict provisions for controlling public spending on private health care delivery, saying that without "significant action" on the issue, "Mr. Martin can't count on our support." Martin for his part offered no comment on a meeting held to discuss the issue, only saying that it was a "good meeting", while Layton publicly expressed his disappointment at the outcome.<ref>{{cite web|title=PM in denial over privatization of health care: Layton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/pm-in-denial-over-privatization-of-health-care-layton-1.549664|website=CBC|publisher=CBC}}</ref> Layton announced he would introduce a motion requesting a February election. However, the Martin government refused to allow the election date to be decided by the opposition. A motion of non-confidence followed, moved by Stephen Harper and seconded by Layton, triggering the 2006 federal election. Layton was working with the Liberal government, but determined he would have a better chance of electoral success by voting against the government and having an election.

====Coalition attempt with the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives====
On March 26, 2011, in response to Harper's allegations that a coalition is not a legitimate or principled way to form government, Duceppe stated that Harper had once tried to form a [[coalition government]] with the Bloc Québécois and NDP.<ref>{{cite news|last=Payton|first=Laura|title=Harper wanted 2004 coalition: Duceppe|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/03/26/cv-kickoff-bloc.html|access-date=March 26, 2011|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref> In 2004 Stephen Harper privately met with [[Bloc Québécois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] and Layton in a Montreal hotel. The meeting that took place between the three party leaders happened 2 months before the federal election.<ref name=gazetteCoalition/> On September 9, 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]], stating,
{{Quote|We respectfully point out that the opposition parties, who together constitute a majority in the House, have been in close consultation. We believe that, should a request for dissolution arise, this should give you cause, as constitutional practice has determined, to consult the opposition leaders and consider all of your options before exercising your constitutional authority.<ref name=gazetteCoalition>{{cite news|title=Harper, Layton, Duceppe sought 'co-opposition' in 2004 letter to GG |url=http://www.canada.com/news/Harper+Layton+Duceppe+sought+opposition+2004+letter/4511865/story.html#ixzz1Htw6yDVP |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]] |date=March 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401200203/http://www.canada.com/news/Harper%2BLayton%2BDuceppe%2Bsought%2Bopposition%2B2004%2Bletter/4511865/story.html |archive-date=April 1, 2011 }}</ref>}}

On the same day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the governor general consult with them before deciding to call an election.<ref name=Harpercoalition>{{cite news|last=Chung|first=Andrew|title=Bloc leader accuses Harper of lying about coalition|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/962240--bloc-leader-accuses-harper-of-lying-about-coalition?bn=1|access-date=March 27, 2011|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref> At the news conference, Harper said "It is the Parliament that's supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That's a criticism I've had and that we've had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that." However, at the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a [[coalition government]].<ref name=gazetteCoalition/> Harper said, "This is not a coalition, but this is a co-operative effort."<ref name=Harpercoalition/>

One month later, on October 4, [[Mike Duffy]], now a Conservative senator (appointed by Harper), said "It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election", and that some Conservatives wanted Harper as prime minister. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace [[Paul Martin]] with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton's accusations.<ref name=gazetteCoalition/>

===2006 campaign===
[[File:Jacklaytonoutside.jpg|right|thumb|In a [[media scrum]] during the 2006 winter election campaign]]

With a vote scheduled for [[2006 Canadian federal election|January 23, 2006]], many New Democrats expected Layton to deliver substantially more seats than he did in 2004. They hoped the NDP would hold the balance of power in a new minority Parliament, so that they could carry additional leverage in negotiating with the governing party. Mike Klander, the executive vice-president of the federal Liberals' Ontario wing, resigned after making posts on his blog comparing Chow to a [[Chow Chow]] dog and calling Layton an "[[asshole]]".<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/liberal-exec-quits-over-his-blog-remarks-about-ndpers-1.545740 Liberal exec quits over his blog remarks about NDPers] CBC.ca. December 27, 2005.</ref>

Through the course of the campaign, Layton attempted to cast himself as the sole remaining champion of [[universal health care]]. Some opinion polls showed that Canadians found Layton the most appealing and charismatic of the leaders. Layton repeatedly insisted that "Canadians have a third choice", and urged Liberals to "lend us your vote". Some commentators and pundits mocked Layton for over-using these catchphrases instead of explaining the NDP platform.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The NDP strategy had changed in that they were focusing their attacks on the Liberals rather than in 2004, where they criticized both the Liberals and Conservatives in equal measure, prompting some criticism from Paul Martin.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/01/17/martin-layton.html Martin attacks Layton for not attacking Harper] January 17, 2006.</ref> [[Andrew Coyne]] suggested that the NDP not only wanted to disassociate themselves from the scandal-ridden Liberals, but also because the Liberals were likely to receive credit for legislation achieved under the Liberal-NDP partnership. The NDP had also lost close races in the 2004 election due to the Liberals' strategic voting. Early in the campaign, NDP MP [[Judy Wasylycia-Leis]] had asked the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) to launch a criminal investigation into the leaking of the income trust announcement.<ref>[https://archive.today/20060302162201/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060121/election_turningpoints_060121?s_name=election2006&no_ads= Income trust a major campaign turning point] CTV News. January 22, 2006. {{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The criminal probe seriously damaged the Liberal campaign and preventing them from making their key policy announcements, as well as bringing alleged Liberal corruption back into the spotlight.

Layton's campaign direction also caused a break between him and [[Canadian Auto Workers]] union head [[Buzz Hargrove]] over the issue of [[Tactical voting|strategic voting]]. Hargrove preferred a Liberal minority government supported by the NDP and he had earlier criticized Layton for participating in the motion of non-confidence that brought down the Liberal government. Hargrove allied with the Liberals and publicly stated that he "did not like the campaign that Jack Layton was running", criticizing Layton for "spending too much time attacking the Liberals". During the final week of the campaign, knowing that last-minute strategic voting had cost the NDP seats in several close ridings during the 2004 election,<ref name="StrategicVote 2004">{{cite news|last=Brennan|first=Richard|title=Liberals stem Conservative tide|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/974828621.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+24%2C+2006&author=Richard+Brennan&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.04&desc=Liberals+stem+Conservative+tide|access-date=August 26, 2011|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=January 24, 2006|location=Toronto|page=A4}}</ref> Hargrove and Martin urged all progressive voters to unite behind the Liberal banner to stop a Conservative government.<ref name=Martinpleads4vote>{{cite news|last=Whittington|first=Wes|title=Don't let Tories tear Canada apart Martin; PM in last-ditch plea to voters Says final outcome will hinge on B.C.|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/974196541.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+23%2C+2006&author=Les+Whittington&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.06&desc=Don%27t+let+Tories+tear+Canada+apart+Martin%3B+PM+in+last-ditch+plea+to+voters+Says+final+outcome+will+hinge+on+B.C.|access-date=August 26, 2006|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=January 23, 2006|location=Toronto|page=A6}}</ref>

Layton intensified his attacks on the Liberal scandals, pledging to use his minority clout to keep the Conservatives in check. Shortly after the election, the Ontario provincial branch of the NDP revoked Hargrove's party membership because he had violated the party's constitution by campaigning for other parties during an election campaign, though Layton disagreed with this. Hargrove retaliated by severing ties with the NDP at the annual CAW convention. The election increased the NDP's total seats to 29 seats, up from 18 before dissolution.<ref name=2006results/> Among the new NDP candidates elected was Olivia Chow, making the two only the second husband-and-wife team in Canadian Parliament history ([[Gurmant Grewal]] and [[Nina Grewal]] were the first husband-and-wife team in Canadian Parliament after the 2004 federal election).

At the NDP's 22nd Convention, held on September 10, 2006, in [[Quebec City]], Layton received a 92% approval rating in a leadership vote, tying former [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] leader [[Preston Manning]]'s record for this kind of voting.<ref>Panetta, Alexander.

===2008 campaign===
[[File:Ed Broadbent and Jack Layton at Toronto Rally.jpg|thumb|right|Broadbent and Jack Layton at a 2008 election rally in Toronto]]

Layton started off the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal election campaign]] with a speech similar to that of U.S. presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. Layton denied he was trying to draw comparisons with Obama, saying "I mean, I am a lot shorter than he is. He is a brilliant orator. I'm never going to claim to be that. But what I have noticed is that the key issues faced by the [[American middle class]], the [[Working class|working people]] of the U.S. and their concerns about their families' futures, are awfully similar to the issues that I hear in Canada." Layton said that he has also written to Obama and [[Hillary Clinton]] saying that the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] had hurt working people in both countries "and those stories have to be told."

Layton, along with Prime Minister Harper and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe, initially opposed the inclusion of [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] leader [[Elizabeth May]] in the leaders' televised debates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/greens-can-t-participate-in-leaders-debates-networks-rule-1.757797 |title=Greens can't participate in leaders debates, networks rule|publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=September 8, 2008|access-date=March 12, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-may-green-party-1.3716899|title=Elizabeth May torpedoes the Green Party... again |work=National Post|access-date=June 5, 2010}}</ref> Layton initially said that he was following the rules of the broadcast consortium, while NDP spokesman [[Brad Lavigne]] confirmed that Layton had refused to attend if May was present, noting that May had endorsed Liberal leader [[Stéphane Dion]] for prime minister, and arguing that her inclusion would in effect give the Liberals two representatives at the debate.

In the end, the NDP gained 8 new seats, taking its tally to 37. This result still left the NDP as Canada's fourth party, behind the Bloc Québécois with 50.

The [[40th Canadian Parliament|40th session of Parliament]] began on November 27, 2008, with a fiscal update by the Conservatives that outlined their agenda for the upcoming term. This included a temporary suspension of federal employees' right to strike and a removal of monetary subsidies for political parties.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/article/544582 Opposition threatens to topple Tories over update] Richard Brennan. ''Toronto Star''. November 27, 2008.</ref> All three opposition parties including the NDP stated that they could not support this position. Layton along with Liberal leader Stéphane Dion and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe began negotiations to form a coalition that would replace the Conservatives as the government. The three opposition parties planned to table a motion of non-confidence in the House of Commons, and counted on the likelihood that the Governor General [[Michaëlle Jean]], would invite the coalition to govern instead of dissolving parliament and calling an election so soon after the last election.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On December 1, 2008, the three opposition leaders signed an accord that laid down the basis for an agreement on a coalition government. The proposed structure would be a coalition between the Liberals and the NDP, with the New Democrats getting six Cabinet positions. Both parties agreed to continue the coalition until June 30, 2011. The Bloc Québécois would not be formally part of the government but would provide support on confidence motions for 18 months.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/liberals-ndp-bloc-sign-deal-on-proposed-coalition-1.700119 Liberals, NDP, Bloc sign deal on proposed coalition] CBC News.

Layton appeared on the [[Télévision de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]] talk show ''[[Tout le monde en parle (Quebec)|Tout le monde en parle]]'' on April 3, an appearance that was credited for improving his party's standing among Francophone voters due to his informal Québécois French.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/layton-remains-game-despite-polls-showing-hes-the-odd-man-out/article575778/ |title=Three leaders, three accents |first=Lysiane |last=Gagnon |date=April 18, 2011 |access-date=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail }}</ref> The show is the most popular program in Quebec.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Sovereignist Lepage opened door for Layton |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Jack+Layton+strong+connection+with+Quebec+province+loved+back/5290922/story.html |author=PHILIP AUTHIER |date=May 7, 2011 |access-date=August 23, 2011 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> He was also perceived to have performed well in the televised French-language party leaders' debate on April 13.

In the May 2, 2011, election, Layton led the NDP to 103 seats, more than double its previous high. This was also enough to make the NDP the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] for the first time. The NDP gains were partly due to a major surge in [[Quebec]] as the party won 59 of the province's 75 seats, dominating Montreal and sweeping [[Quebec City]] and the [[Outaouais]], although the NDP also won more seats than any other opposition party in the rest of Canada. The NDP had gone into the election with only one seat in Quebec, that of [[Thomas Mulcair]], and had won but a single seat in the province historically ([[Phil Edmonston]] in a 1990 by-election). Many of these gains came at the expense of the Bloc, which was reduced to a four-seat rump without official party status in Parliament.

He noted that his father [[Robert Layton (politician)|Robert Layton]] had the same type of cancer 17 years before and recovered from it. His wife, [[Olivia Chow]], had [[thyroid cancer]] a few years before.

Following the 2011 federal election, Layton led the party into the first month of the new session of Parliament, as well as attending the NDP Federal Convention in [[Vancouver]]. After Parliament rose for the summer, Layton announced on July 25, 2011 that he would be taking a temporary leave from his post to fight an unspecified, newly diagnosed cancer. He was hoping to return as leader of the NDP upon the resumption of the House of Commons on September 19, 2011.
