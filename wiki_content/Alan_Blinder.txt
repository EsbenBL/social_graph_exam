'''Alan Stuart Blinder''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|l|aɪ|n|d|ər}}, born October 14, 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] and the [[Gordon S. Rentschler]] Memorial Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at [[Princeton University]] who served as the [[Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve]] under President Bill Clinton.

Blinder is among the most influential economists in the world according to [[RePEc|IDEAS/RePEc]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html|title=Economist Rankings &#124; IDEAS/RePEc|website=ideas.repec.org}}</ref>

He served on President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Council of Economic Advisers]] from January 1993 to June 1994<ref name="NYTimes, Jan. 1993">[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/04/business/princeton-economist-to-be-named-to-clinton-s-council-aides-say.html Princeton Economist to Be Named To Clinton's Council, Aides Say], ''New York Times'' (archives), Louis Uchitelle, Jan. 4, 1993.</ref> and as the Vice Chairman of the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] from June 1994 to January 1996.<ref name=pbio/> Blinder's academic work has focused particularly on [[monetary policy]] and [[central banking]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Alan Blinder | url=https://www.princeton.edu/~blinder/articles.htm}}</ref> and on the "[[offshoring]]" of jobs. His writing has been published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as well as a monthly column in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

Regarding the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], Blinder drew ten lessons for fellow economists, including: "''It can happen here''," "''Fraud and near-fraud can rise to attain [[macroeconomic]] significance''," "''Excessive complexity is not just [[anti-competitive]], it's dangerous''," and "''Go-for-broke incentives will induce traders to go for broke''."<ref name=learn/>

==Early life==
Blinder was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IB3mBsgfIHQC&pg=PA721&lpg=PA721&dq=Alan%20Blinder&f=false | title=Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, Volume 1 | editor=Stephen Harlan Norwood, Eunice G. Pollack | page=721}}</ref> in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He graduated from [[Syosset High School]] in [[Syosset, New York]]. Blinder attended Princeton University as an undergraduate student and graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in economics in 1967. He completed a 130-page long senior thesis, titled "The Theory of Corporate Choice".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Blinder |first=Alan Stuart | work=Princeton University.

In 2009 Blinder was inducted into the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]], "for his distinguished scholarship on fiscal policy, monetary policy and the distribution of income, and for consistently bringing that knowledge to bear on the public arena."<ref>Princeton University, 24 June 2009, [https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S24/58/92G71/index.xml?section=people Blinder named fellow of American Academy of Political and Social Science], accessed 14 August 2009</ref> He is a strong proponent of [[free trade]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Blinder |first1=Alan S. |editor= David R.

===Political career===
Blinder served as the Deputy Assistant Director of the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (1975), on President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Council of Economic Advisers]] (January 1993 - June 1994),<ref name=pbio/><ref name="NYTimes, Jan. 1993"/> and as the [[Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve]] from June 27, 1994, to January 31, 1996.<ref name=pbio/> As Vice Chairman, he cautioned against raising interest rates too quickly to slow inflation because of the lags in earlier rises feeding through into the economy. He also warned against ignoring the short term costs in terms of unemployment that inflation-fighting could cause.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 March 1995, [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/18/business/opening-fed-s-doors-inside-alan-blinder-preaches-communication-tight-lipped.html Opening the Fed's Doors From Inside; Alan Blinder Preaches Communication at Tight-Lipped Central Bank]</ref>

Many have argued that Blinder's stint at the Fed was cut short because of his tendency to challenge chairman [[Alan Greenspan]]:

{{quote|[Economist] Rob Johnson, who watched the Blinder ordeal, says Blinder made the mistake of behaving as if the Fed was a place where competing ideas and assumptions were debated. "Sociologically, what was happening was the Fed staff was really afraid of Blinder. At some level, as an applied empirical economist, Alan Blinder is really brilliant," says Johnson.

In closed-door meetings, Blinder did what so few do: challenged assumptions. The Fed staff would come out and their ritual is: Greenspan has kind of told them what to conclude and they produce studies in which they conclude this. And Blinder treated it more like an open academic debate when he first got there and he'd come out and say, 'Well, that's not true. If you change this assumption and change this assumption and use this kind of assumption you get a completely different result.' And it just created a stir inside – it was sort of like the whole pipeline of Greenspan-arriving-at-decisions was disrupted.

This put him in conflict with Greenspan and his staff. "A lot of senior staff ... were pissed off about Blinder – how should we say? – not playing by the customs that they were accustomed to," Johnson says.<ref name=Grim>[[Ryan Grim|Grim, Ryan]] (2009-09-07) [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/07/priceless-how-the-federal_n_278805.html Priceless: How The Federal Reserve Bought The Economics Profession], ''[[Huffington Post]]''</ref>}}

He was an adviser to [[Al Gore]] and [[John Kerry]] during their respective presidential campaigns in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]].<ref name=pbio/>

==="Cash for Clunkers"===
{{main|Car Allowance Rebate System}}
Blinder was an early advocate of a "[[Cash for Clunkers]]" program, in which the government buys some of the oldest, most-polluting vehicles and [[wikt:scrap|scraps]] them. In July 2008, he wrote an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' advocating such a program,<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |first=Alan S. |last=Blinder |title=A Modest Proposal: Eco-Friendly Stimulus |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/business/27view.html |work=The New York Times |date=27 July 2008 }}</ref> which was implemented by the [[Obama administration]] during the summer of 2009.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111781653 Why One Economist Pushed Cash For Clunkers], National Public Radio, August 11, 2009.</ref> Blinder asserted it could stimulate the economy, benefit the environment, and reduce income inequality.<ref name=nyt/> The program was praised by President Obama for "exceeding expectations,"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574324350084909302 More Cash for Clunkers?; Despite the frenzy, another $2 billion may not sell any additional cars.], ''Wall Street Journal'', August 3, 2009.</ref> but criticized for economic and environmental reasons.<ref>Derek Thompson, [http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/08/why_cash_for_clunkers_is_a_bad_policy.php The Senate Should Kill Cash for Clunkers], ''The Atlantic'', August 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/07/earlyshow/main5224093.shtml "Cash for Clunkers" Bad for Environment?], CBS News, August 7, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/6604762.html Clearing the air; Environmental benefits limited from ‘Clunkers’ deal], ''The Houston Chronicle'', September 5, 2009.</ref><ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/stimulus-for-clunkers-1407281653],''"Stimulus For Clunkers" Wall Street Journal'', August 6, 2014.</ref>

===Private sector===
Blinder was a co-founder and a vice-chair of the [[Promontory Financial Group#Organization|Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

After his service as the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Blinder, along with several former regulators, founded a company that offers a number of services that provide a means for depositors (including governmental entities, nonprofits, businesses, as well as individuals such as retirees) to access millions in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage at a single institution instead of multiple ones.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} This provides banks that are members the ability to offer coverage above the FDIC per account/per bank limit by letting those banks place funds into CDs or deposit accounts issued by other network banks. This occurs in increments below the standard FDIC insurance maximum ($250,000) so that both principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance.<ref name="Svaldi">{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_10231862 | work=Denver Post | first=Aldo | last=Svaldi | date=18 August 2008 | title=CDARS, safety in numbers for big bank customers}}</ref> The company acts as a sort of clearinghouse, matching deposits from one institution with another.<ref name="Svaldi"/> Through its services it allows access to higher levels of FDIC insurance although limits apply.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taleb, Nassim Nicholas, 1960-|title=Antifragile : things that gain from disorder|date=2012|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4000-6782-4|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=774490503}}</ref>

===Views regarding 2008 near-meltdown of major financial institutions===

Blinder draws 10 lessons for fellow economists in an article entitled "What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?":<ref name=learn>[https://wws.princeton.edu/system/files/research/documents/Blinder_What_Did_We_Learn_from_the_Financial_Crisis_the_Great_Recession_and_the_Pathetic_Recovery.pdf "What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?"], Alan Blinder, Nov. 2014. Blinder credits fellow economists [[Carmen Reinhart|Carmen Reinhart (1955– )]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff|Kenneth Rogoff (1953– )]] with describing important features of a worse-than-normal recession in which both parts of the financial system are destroyed and large amounts of debt are left in its wake.</ref><ref>National Bureau of Economic Research, [https://www.nber.org/cycles.html US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions]. The recession was later determined to have begun in Dec. 2007 with the trough occurring in June 2009. And from that point forward until Feb. 2020, the US economy was in expansion mode.</ref><ref>Blinder states that it wasn’t until 2011 (2nd quarter) that GDP climbed back to its Dec. 2007 level, and it wasn’t until May 2014 that payroll employment climbed back to its Jan. 2008 peak.</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=August 2020}}

{{Quote|
1) ''It can happen here''.<br><br>
2) ''Hyman Minsky was basically right''. " . . The financial world envisioned by [[Hyman Minsky|Minsky]] is different in every respect from the EMH [Efficient Markets Hypothesis] paradigm. While the good times are rolling, people forget the bitter lessons of the past. (“This time is different.”) So financial excesses grow more, not less, severe as the bubble progresses—creating greater vulnerability to shocks and more damage when the crash comes. The crash itself always seems to come as a surprise; and after it, sentiment swings radically in the other direction. People shun risk, pessimism rules, and the economy struggles. . "<ref>Blinder writes, "The financial system is a zoo that needs zookeepers, lest the wilder animals escape and wreak havoc upon the rest of us."</ref><br><br>
3) ''Reinhart-Rogoff recessions are worse than Keynesian recessions''. " . . Reinhart-Rogoff recessions destroy parts of the financial system and leave much of the rest reeling—and needing to deleverage. All of that stunts and delays recovery. Reinhart-Rogoff recessions also leave large buildups of debt—financial sector debt, corporate debt, household debt, and public debt—in their wake. . "<ref>Blinder writes, "If fiscal expansion is blocked by a large public debt, and monetary expansion is blocked by zero interest rates, recovery from a Reinhart-Rogoff recession (unlike a Keynesian recession) may require debt-reducing policies such as explicit debt forgiveness or implicit repudiation through inflation. Not your father's recovery policies."</ref><ref>In contrast, the much more common Keynesian recession responds relatively promptly, perhaps in a matter of months, to the standard tools of monetary stimulus (lower interest rates) and fiscal stimulus (tax cuts and/or deficit spending).</ref><ref>In a later passage (page 16), Blinder writes, " . . stimulus does not require larger government. Congress can use tax cuts instead—or the Fed can chip in with monetary policy. Indeed, both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush were big Keynesians—in deeds, if not in words."</ref><br><br>
4) ''Self-regulation is oxymoronic''.<br><br>
5) ''Fraud and near-fraud can rise to attain macroeconomic significance''.<br><br>
6) ''Excessive complexity is not just anti-competitive, it's dangerous''.<br><br>
7) ''Go-for-broke incentives will induce traders to go for broke''.<br><br>
8) ''Illiquidity closely resembles insolvency''. Blinder asks, Was the situation with [[Bear Stearns#Fed bailout and sale to JPMorgan Chase|Bear Stearns]], which was saved in March 2008, really so different from the situation with [[Lehman Brothers#Bankruptcy|Lehman Brothers]], which was allowed to go bankrupt in September 2008?<ref>Regarding [[Bear Stearns#Fed bailout and sale to JPMorgan Chase|Bear Stearns]], Blinder writes, "Bear Stearns was bleeding cash in March 2008, owing largely to rumors (based on facts!) of large losses in its mortgage businesses. In the fateful days before its shotgun marriage to J.P. Morgan Chase, Bear was about to run out of cash."</ref><ref>Regarding [[Lehman Brothers#Bankruptcy|Lehman Brothers in Sept. 2008]], Blinder writes, "Lehman Brothers showed remarkably similar symptoms: a liquidity squeeze brought on by rumors (truths?) of large losses in real estate and mortgage-backed securities. Same problem, same solution, right? Wrong. This time, the Fed judged that Lehman was not just ''illiquid'' but also ''insolvent''."</ref><ref>Blinder writes, “Such fire sales fetch low prices, which can turn positive net worth into negative net worth. Thus ''illiquidity'' can lead to ''insolvency''.”</ref><br><br>
9) ''Moral hazard isn't a show-stopper, it's a tradeoff.''<ref>Blinder writes, “But in the midst of a crisis, with the house on fire, it may be imperative to douse the fire first and try to persuade the occupant not to smoke later—time inconsistency notwithstanding. Yes, bailouts set bad
precedents, but letting a crisis spin out of control may be far worse.”</ref><br><br>
10) ''Economic illiteracy can really hurt''.}}
