She is best known for her contribution to the development—jointly with [[Ernesto Laclau]], with whom she co-authored ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]''—of the so-called [[Essex School of discourse analysis]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Townshend |first1=Jules |title=Discourse Theory and Political Analysis: A New Paradigm from the Essex School? |journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations |date=21 June 2016 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=129–142 |doi=10.1111/1467-856X.00100}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Townshend |first1=Jules |title=Laclau and Mouffe's Hegemonic Project: The Story So Far |journal=Political Studies |date=24 June 2016 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=269–288 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.2004.00479.x}}</ref> a type of [[post-Marxist]] political inquiry drawing on [[Gramsci]], [[post-structuralism]] and theories of identity, and redefining Leftist politics in terms of radical democracy.

==Education==
Chantal Mouffe studied at the Universities of [[Université catholique de Louvain|Louvain]], [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Essex|Essex]] and has worked in many universities throughout the world (in Europe, North America and Latin America). She has also held visiting positions at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] (Paris). During 1989–1995, she served as Programme Director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] in Paris. She currently holds a professorship at the Department of Politics and International Relations, [[University of Westminster]] in the United Kingdom, where she directs the Centre for the Study of Democracy.<ref name="Westminster"/>

==Work==
A prominent critic of [[deliberative democracy]] (especially in its [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] versions), she is also known for her use of the work of [[Carl Schmitt]], mainly the concept of "the political", in proposing a radicalization of modern democracy—what she calls "agonistic pluralism". She has developed an interest in highlighting the radical potential of artistic practices.<ref>”Mouffe, Chantal, “Artistic Strategies in Politics and Political Strategies in Art” in Tom Bieling (Ed.) (2019): Design (&) Activism: Perspectives on Design as Activism and Activism as Design, Milano: Mimesis, p. 53–57</ref> Mouffe's ''Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically'' (2013) has been criticised by Timothy Laurie for its strong focus on State institutions, noting that Mouffe's "professed enthusiasm for (some) non-Western Islamist movements is solely conditional upon their assumption of State instruments".<ref>{{Cite journal | title= Review: 'Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically' | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal= Melbourne Journal of Politics | year= 2013 | url= https://www.academia.edu/5433656 | volume=36 |pages=76–78}}</ref>
