* member of the Advisory Council of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] and the Advisory Committee on Population for the U.S. [[Bureau of the Census]]

Davis won the Irene B. Taeuber Award for outstanding research in demography (1978), the Common Wealth Award for distinguished work in sociology (1979), and the Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award from the American Sociological Association (1982).<ref name="Obituary">[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970305davisobit.html Obituary] at Stanford News</ref>
In 1953 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=February 1954|doi=10.1080/00031305.1954.10482018|issue=1|journal=[[The American Statistician]]|jstor=2681662|pages=17–18|title=Election of New Fellows|volume=8}}</ref>

==Research==
Davis led and conducted major studies of societies in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia, coined the term "[[population explosion]]", and played a major role in the naming and development of the  [[demographic transition]] model.<ref name="Kingsley Davis"/><ref>[http://www.aps-pub.com/proceedings/1433/Davis.pdf Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010645/http://www.aps-pub.com/proceedings/1433/Davis.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} from ''Proceedings of the [[American Philosophical Society]]''</ref> He was also one of the original scholars in the development of the theory of [[overurbanization]].<ref name="Sovani">Sovani, N. V. “The Analysis of ‘Over-Urbanization.’” ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 12, no. 2 (January 1, 1964): 113–122.</ref><ref name="Davis">Davis, Kingsley, and Hilda Hertz Golden. “Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas.” Economic Development and Cultural Change 3, no. 1 (October 1954): 6–26.</ref> He is also credited with coining the term "[[zero population growth]]" <ref name="Kingsley Davis"/><ref name="StanfordObit"/> although  George Stolnitz claimed to have that distinction.<ref>George J. Stolnitz (1955) ''Population Studies'', Vol. 9, No. 1. pp. 24–55</ref>

Davis had several children while espousing limitations on childbearing worldwide. Davis also published an influential article with [[Wilbert E. Moore]] entitled "Some Principles of Stratification,"<ref>Davis, K, and Moore, W. E. "Some principles of stratification." ''American Sociological Review,'' 10 (2), 242–249</ref> which was a very influential [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] account of the reasons for social inequality. Davis and Moore synthesize [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Talcott Parsons|Parsons]] to argue for the "[[The Davis-Moore hypothesis|functional necessity]]" of some positions over others: those that are highest paid go to the most deserving individuals; at the same time, the differential rewards motivates individuals to work to fill positions they might otherwise not. Thus, from this perspective, illness is a deviant state because it means that the individual may not be able to fill their role. Sociologists see this article as a paradigmatic case of functionalist logic, and indeed, Davis came to be a leading figure in this school of sociology.<ref>De Maio, F. ''Health & Social Theory.'' London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, 29.</ref>

As a demographer, Davis was internationally recognized for his expertise in [[world population]] growth and resources, the history and theory of international [[human migration|migration]], world [[urbanization]], demographic transition and population policy.<ref name="StanfordObit">{{cite news |title= Kingsley Davis, Hoover fellow, demographer, sociologist, dies at age 88 |date=4 March 1997 |newspaper=Stanford News Service |publisher=Stanford University |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970305davisobit.html |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>
