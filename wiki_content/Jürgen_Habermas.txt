His work addresses [[communicative rationality]] and the [[public sphere]].

Associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], Habermas's work focuses on the foundations of [[epistemology]] and [[social theory]], the analysis of [[advanced capitalism]] and [[democracy]], the [[rule of law]] in a critical [[Sociocultural evolution|social-evolutionary context]], albeit within the confines of the [[natural law]] tradition,<ref>Cf. Thomas Kupka, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23999017?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jürgen Habermas' diskurstheoretische Reformulierung des klassischen Vernunftrechts], ''Kritische Justiz'' 27 (1994), pp. 461–469.

Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of [[reason]], [[Political emancipation|emancipation]], and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas was known for his work on the concept of [[modernity]], particularly with respect to the discussions of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] originally set forth by [[Max Weber]]. He has been influenced by [[American pragmatism]], [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]], and [[poststructuralism]].

==Biography==
{{Frankfurt School}}

Habermas was born in [[Gummersbach]], [[Rhine Province]], in 1929. He was born with a [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]] and had corrective surgery twice during childhood.<ref>{{cite document|title=Disabling Democracy: How Disability Reconfigures Deliberative Democratic Norms|first1=Clifford|last1=Simplican|last2=Stacy|date=28 October 2017|ssrn = 1451092}}</ref> Habermas argues that his speech disability made him think differently about the importance of deep dependence and of communication.<ref>Habermas, Jurgen. 2008. Between Naturalism and Religion: Philosophical Essays. (First chapter).</ref>

As a young teenager, he was profoundly affected by [[World War II]]. Until his graduation from [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], Habermas lived in [[Gummersbach]], near [[Cologne]]. His father, Ernst Habermas, was Executive director of the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and was described by Habermas as a Nazi sympathizer and, from 1933, a member of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]. Habermas himself was a ''Jungvolkführer'', a leader of the [[Deutsches Jungvolk|German Jungvolk]], which was a section of the [[Hitler Youth]]. He was brought up in a staunchly [[Protestant]] [[milieu]], his grandfather being the director of the seminary in Gummersbach. He studied at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1949/50), [[University of Zurich|Zurich]] (1950/51), and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (1951–54) and earned a doctorate in [[philosophy]] from Bonn in 1954 with a dissertation written on the conflict between [[the absolute]] and [[history]] in [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling's]] thought, entitled, ''{{lang|de|Das Absolute und die Geschichte. Von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken}}'' ("The Absolute and History: On the Schism in Schelling's Thought"). His dissertation committee included [[Erich Rothacker]] and [[Oskar Becker]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOLWAAAAMAAJ|title=Das Absolute und die Geschichte: von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken|first=Jurgen|last=Habermas |date=1954|publisher=Gummers}}</ref>

From 1956 on, he studied [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]] under the [[critical theorists]] [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]'s [[Institute for Social Research]], but because of a rift between the two over his [[dissertation]]—Horkheimer had made unacceptable demands for revision—as well as his own belief that the [[Frankfurt School]] had become paralyzed with political skepticism and disdain for [[modern culture]],<ref name=cjc352>Craig J. Calhoun, ''Contemporary Sociological Theory'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 352. {{ISBN|0-631-21350-3}}.</ref> he finished his [[habilitation]] in [[political science]] at the [[University of Marburg]] under the Marxist [[Wolfgang Abendroth]]. His habilitation work was entitled ''{{lang|de|Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit. Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft}}'' (published in English translation in 1989 as ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society''). It is a detailed social history of the development of the [[bourgeois]] [[public sphere]] from its origins in the 18th century salons up to its transformation through the influence of capital-driven [[mass media]]. In 1961 he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in Marburg, and—in a move that was highly unusual for the German academic scene of that time—he was offered the position of "extraordinary professor" (professor without chair) of philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]] (at the instigation of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Karl Löwith]]) in 1962, which he accepted. In this same year he gained his first serious public attention, in Germany, with the publication of his habilitation. In 1964, strongly supported by Adorno, Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's chair in philosophy and sociology. The philosopher [[Albrecht Wellmer]] was his assistant in Frankfurt from 1966 to 1970.

He accepted the position of Director of the [[Max Planck Institute#Former institutes|Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World]] in [[Starnberg]] (near [[Munich]]) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]''. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=19 April 2011}}</ref>

Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and the directorship of the Institute for Social Research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas has continued to publish extensively. In 1986, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}}, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He also holds the position of "permanent visiting" professor at [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston, Illinois, and "[[Theodor Heuss]] Professor" at [[The New School]], [[New York City|New York]].

Habermas was awarded The [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/gedavis/JH/Kyoto_lecture_Nov_2004.pdf Public space and political public sphere] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204151440/http://homepage.mac.com/gedavis/JH/Kyoto_lecture_Nov_2004.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }} (pp. 2–4).</ref> in the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy|Arts and Philosophy]] section. He traveled to [[San Diego]] and on 5 March 2005, as part of the [[University of San Diego]]'s [[Kyoto Symposium]], gave a speech entitled ''The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context'', regarding the evolution of [[separation of church and state]] from neutrality to intense [[secularism]]. He received the 2005 [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] (about €520,000). In 2007, Habermas was listed as the seventh most-cited author in the [[humanities]] (including the [[social science]]s) by ''[[The Times Higher Education Guide]]'', ahead of Max Weber and behind [[Erving Goffman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=26 March 2009 |access-date=16 November 2009}}</ref> [[Bibliometrics|Bibliometric]] studies demonstrate his continuing influence and increasing relevance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Buhmann|first1=Alexander|last2=Ihlen|first2=Øyvind|last3=Aaen-Stockdale|first3=Craig|date=2019-11-04|title=Connecting the dots: a bibliometric review of Habermasian theory in public relations research|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JCOM-12-2018-0127/full/html|journal=Journal of Communication Management|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=444–467|doi=10.1108/JCOM-12-2018-0127|hdl=10852/74987|s2cid=210568613|issn=1363-254X|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

Jürgen Habermas is the father of [[Rebekka Habermas]], historian of German social and cultural history and professor of modern history at the [[University of Göttingen]].

===Teacher and mentor===
Habermas was a famed teacher and mentor. Among his most prominent students were the pragmatic philosopher Herbert Schnädelbach (theorist of discourse distinction and rationality), the political sociologist [[Claus Offe]] (professor at the [[Hertie School of Governance]] in Berlin), the social philosopher Johann Arnason (professor at [[La Trobe University]] and chief editor of the journal ''[[Thesis Eleven]]''), the social philosopher [[Hans-Herbert Kögler]] (Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of North Florida]]), the sociological theorist [[Hans Joas]] (professor at the [[University of Erfurt]] and at the [[University of Chicago]]), the theorist of societal [[evolution]] Klaus Eder, the social philosopher [[Axel Honneth]], the political theorist David Rasmussen  (professor at [[Boston College]] and chief editor of the journal "[[Philosophy & Social Criticism]]"), the environmental ethicist [[Konrad Ott]], the anarcho-capitalist philosopher [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] (who came to reject much of Habermas's thought),<ref>[[Lew Rockwell]], introduction to Hoppe's ''A Short History of Man'' (2015), Auburn, Mississippi: Mises Institute, p. 9.</ref> the American philosopher [[Thomas A. McCarthy|Thomas McCarthy]], the co-creator of mindful inquiry in social research [[Jeremy J. Shapiro]], and the assassinated Serbian prime minister [[Zoran Đinđić]].

==Philosophy and sociology==
Habermas has constructed a comprehensive framework of philosophy and social theory drawing on a number of intellectual traditions:<ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981">Habermas, Jurgen (1981), ''Kleine Politische Schrifen I-IV'', pp. 500f.</ref>
* the [[German philosophy|German philosophical thought]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]
* the [[Marxist philosophy|Marxian]] tradition—both the theory of [[Karl Marx]] himself as well as the critical [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxian]] theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], i.e. [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]].<ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"/>
* the sociological theories of [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[George Herbert Mead]]
* the [[linguistic philosophy]] and [[speech act]] theories of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], [[P. F. Strawson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[John Searle]]
* the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]
* the American pragmatist tradition of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[John Dewey]]
* the sociological [[social system|social systems theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]]
* [[Neo-Kantian]] thought<ref>Müller-Doohm, Stefan. Jürgen Habermas. Frankfurt, Suhrkamp, 2008 (Suhrkamp BasisBiographie, 38).</ref>

Jürgen Habermas considers his major contribution to be the development of the concept and theory of communicative reason or communicative rationality, which distinguishes itself from the [[rationalism|rationalist tradition]], by locating [[rationality]] in structures of interpersonal linguistic [[communication]] rather than in the structure of the [[cosmos]]. This social theory advances the goals of [[human emancipation]], while maintaining an inclusive [[universalist]] [[morality|moral]] framework. This framework rests on the argument called [[universal pragmatics]]—that all [[speech acts]] have an inherent [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] (the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "purpose")—the goal of mutual [[understanding]], and that human beings possess the communicative competence to bring about such understanding. Habermas built the framework out of the [[speech-act]] philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]] and [[John Searle]], the sociological theory of the interactional constitution of mind and self of [[George Herbert Mead]], the [[moral development|theories of moral development]] of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], and the [[discourse ethics]] of his Frankfurt colleague and fellow student [[Karl-Otto Apel]].

Habermas's works resonate within the traditions of Kant and [[the Enlightenment]] and of [[democratic socialism]] through his emphasis on the potential for transforming the world and arriving at a more humane, just, and egalitarian society through the realization of the human potential for reason, in part through discourse ethics. While Habermas has stated that the Enlightenment is an "unfinished project," he argues it should be corrected and complemented, not discarded.<ref name=cjc351>Calhoun (2002), p. 351.</ref> In this he distances himself from the Frankfurt School, criticizing it, as well as much of [[postmodernist]] thought, for excessive pessimism, [[Political radicalism|radicalism]], and exaggerations.<ref name=cjc351/>

Within sociology, Habermas's major contribution was the development of a comprehensive theory of [[societal evolution]] and [[modernization]] focusing on the difference between communicative rationality and rationalization on one hand and strategic/[[instrumental rationality]] and rationalization on the other. This includes a critique from a communicative standpoint of the differentiation-based [[theory]] of [[social system]]s developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]], a student of [[Talcott Parsons]].

His defence of modernity and [[civil society]] has been a source of inspiration to others, and is considered a major philosophical alternative to the varieties of poststructuralism. He has also offered an influential analysis of [[late capitalism]].

Habermas perceives the rationalization, [[humanism|humanization]] and [[democratization]] of society in terms of the [[institutionalization]] of the potential for rationality that is inherent in the [[communicative competence]] that is unique to the [[human species]]. Habermas contends that communicative competence has developed through the course of evolution, but in contemporary society it is often suppressed or weakened by the way in which major domains of social life, such as the [[Market (economics)|market]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and [[organization]]s, have been given over to or taken over by strategic/instrumental rationality, so that the logic of the system supplants that of the [[lifeworld]].

===Reconstructive science===
Habermas introduces the concept of "reconstructive science" with a double purpose: to place the "general theory of society" between philosophy and social science and re-establish the rift between the "great theorization" and the "empirical research".
The model of "[[rational reconstruction]]s" represents the main thread of the surveys about the "structures" of the world of life ("culture", "society" and "personality") and their respective "functions" (cultural reproductions, social integrations and socialization). For this purpose, the dialectics between "symbolic representation" of "the structures subordinated to all worlds of
life" ("internal relationships") and the "material reproduction" of the social systems in their complex ("external relationships" between social systems and environment) has to be considered.

This model finds an application, above all, in the "theory of the social evolution", starting from the reconstruction of the necessary conditions for a [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] of the socio-cultural life forms (the "hominization") until an analysis of the development of "social formations", which Habermas subdivides into primitive, traditional, modern and contemporary formations.
"This paper is an attempt, primarily, to formalize the model of "reconstruction of the logic of development" of "social formations" summed up by Habermas through the differentiation between vital world and social systems (and, within them, through the "rationalization of the world of life" and the "growth in complexity of the social systems"). Secondly, it tries to offer some methodological clarifications about the "explanation of the dynamics" of "historical processes" and, in particular, about the "theoretical meaning" of the evolutional theory's propositions.  Even if the German sociologist considers that the "ex-post rational reconstructions" and "the models system/environment" cannot have a complete "historiographical application", these certainly act as a general premise in the argumentative structure of the "historical explanation"".<ref name="Corchia">{{citation | first = Luca | last = Corchia | chapter = Explicative models of complexity.

===The public sphere===
{{details|Public sphere}}
In ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]],'' Habermas argues that prior to the 18th century, European culture had been dominated by a "representational" culture, where one party sought to "represent" itself on its audience by overwhelming its subjects.<ref name=Blanning26>Blanning, T. C. W. ''The French Revolution Class War or Culture Clash?'', New York: St. Martin's Press (1987), 2nd edition 1998, p. 26.</ref> As an example of "representational" culture, Habermas argued that [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s [[Palace of Versailles]] was meant to show the greatness of the French state and its King by overpowering the senses of visitors to the Palace.<ref name=Blanning26 /> Habermas identifies "representational" culture as corresponding to the feudal stage of development according to Marxist theory, arguing that the coming of the capitalist stage of development marked the appearance of ''Öffentlichkeit'' (the public sphere).<ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. pages 26-27">Blanning (1998), pp. 26–27.</ref> In the culture characterized by ''Öffentlichkeit'', there occurred a public space outside of the control by the state, where individuals exchanged views and knowledge.<ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27">Blanning (1998), p. 27.</ref>

In Habermas's view, the growth in [[newspaper]]s, [[Literary magazine|journals]], reading clubs, [[Masonic lodge]]s, and [[coffeehouse]]s in 18th-century Europe, all in different ways, marked the gradual replacement of "representational" culture with ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture.<ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /> Habermas argued that the essential characteristic of the ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture was its "critical" nature.<ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /> Unlike "representational" culture where only one party was active and the other passive, the ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture was characterized by a dialogue as individuals either met in conversation, or exchanged views via the print media.<ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /> Habermas maintains that as Britain was the most liberal country in Europe, the culture of the public sphere emerged there first around 1700, and the growth of ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture took place over most of the 18th century in Continental Europe.<ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /> In his view, the [[French Revolution]] was in large part caused by the collapse of "representational" culture, and its replacement by ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture.<ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /> Though Habermas's main concern in ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' was to expose what he regarded as the deceptive nature of free institutions in the West, his book had a major effect on the historiography of the French Revolution.<ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. pages 26-27" />

According to Habermas, a variety of factors resulted in the eventual decay of the public sphere, including the growth of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[mass media]], which turned the critical public into a passive consumer public; and the welfare state, which merged the state with society so thoroughly that the public sphere was squeezed out. It also turned the "public sphere" into a site of self-interested contestation for the resources of the state rather than a space for the development of a public-minded [[rational consensus]].

His most known work to date, the ''[[Theory of Communicative Action]]'' (1981), is based on an adaptation of Talcott Parsons [[AGIL Paradigm]]. In this work, Habermas voiced criticism of the process of modernization, which he saw as inflexible direction forced through by economic and administrative rationalization.<ref name=cjc353>Calhoun (2002), p. 353.</ref> Habermas outlined how our everyday lives are penetrated by formal systems as parallel to development of the [[welfare state]], [[corporate capitalism]] and [[mass consumption]].<ref name=cjc353/> These reinforcing trends rationalize public life.<ref name=cjc353/> Disfranchisement of citizens occurs as political parties and interest groups become rationalized and [[representative democracy]] replaces [[participatory democracy|participatory one]].<ref name=cjc353/> In consequence, boundaries between public and private, the individual and society, the [[Social system|system]] and the lifeworld are deteriorating.<ref name=cjc353/> Democratic public life cannot develop where matters of public importance are not discussed by citizens.<ref name=cjc354>Calhoun (2002), p. 354.</ref> An "[[ideal speech situation]]"<ref>{{cite book |title=Democracy, Power and Legitimacy: The Critical Theory of Jürgen Habermas |last=Payrow Shabani |first=Omid A. |year=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn= 978-0-8020-8761-4 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKDU3l3cq60C&pg=PA49}}</ref> requires participants to have the same capacities of discourse, social equality and their words are not confused by ideology or other errors.<ref name=cjc354/> In this version of the [[consensus theory of truth]] Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation.

Habermas has expressed optimism about the possibility of the revival of the public sphere.<ref name=cjc355>Calhoun (2002), p. 355.</ref> He discerns a hope for the future where the representative democracy-reliant [[nation-state]] is replaced by a [[deliberative democracy]]-reliant political organism based on the equal rights and obligations of citizens.<ref name=cjc355/> In such a direct democracy-driven system, the activist public sphere is needed for debates on matters of public importance as well as the mechanism for that discussion to affect the [[decision-making process]].

==Habermas versus postmodernists==
Habermas offered some early criticisms in an essay, "Modernity versus Postmodernity" (1981),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|last2=Ben-Habib|first2=Seyla|date=1981|title=Modernity versus Postmodernity|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/487859|journal=New German Critique|issue=22|pages=3–14|doi=10.2307/487859|issn=0094-033X}}</ref> which has achieved wide recognition. In that essay, Habermas raises the issue of whether, in light of the failures of the twentieth century, we "should try to hold on to the ''intentions of the Enlightenment'', feeble as they may be, or should we declare the entire project of modernity a lost cause?"<ref name="Ritzer, George Pg. 567-568">Ritzer, George, ''Sociological Theory'', ''From Modern to Postmodern Social Theory (and Beyond)'', McGraw-Hill Higher Education, New York, New York, 2008, pp. 567–568.</ref> Habermas refuses to give up on the possibility of a rational, "scientific" understanding of the life-world.

Habermas has several main criticisms of [[postmodernism]]:

# Postmodernists are equivocal about whether they are producing serious theory or literature;
# Postmodernists are animated by normative sentiments, but the nature of those sentiments remains concealed from the reader;
# Postmodernism has a totalizing perspective that fails "to differentiate phenomena and practices that occur within modern society";<ref name="Ritzer, George Pg. 567-568"/>
# Postmodernists ignore everyday life and its practices, which Habermas finds absolutely central.

==Key dialogues and engagement with politics==
=== Positivism dispute ===
{{Main|Positivism dispute}}
The [[positivism dispute]] was a political-philosophical dispute between the critical rationalists ([[Karl Popper]], [[Hans Albert]]) and the Frankfurt School ([[Theodor Adorno]], Jürgen Habermas) in 1961, about the methodology of the social sciences. It grew into a broad discussion within German sociology from 1961 to 1969. 

=== Habermas and Gadamer ===
There is a controversy between Habermas and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] about limits of [[hermeneutics]]. Gadamer completed his magnum opus, ''Truth and Method''  in 1960, and engaged in his debate with Habermas over the possibility of transcending history and culture in order to find a truly objective position from which to critique society. 

=== Habermas and Foucault ===

There is a dispute concerning whether [[Michel Foucault]]'s ideas of "power analytics" and "[[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogy]]" or Jürgen Habermas' ideas of "[[communicative rationality]]" and "[[discourse ethics]]" provide a better critique of the nature of power in society. The debate compares and evaluates the central ideas of Habermas and Foucault as they pertain to questions of [[power (sociology)|power]], [[reason]], [[ethics]], [[modernity]], [[democracy]], [[civil society]], and [[social action]]. 

=== Habermas and Luhmann ===
[[Niklas Luhmann]] proposed that society could be successfully analyzed through [[systems theory]]. There is a conflict between Jürgen Habermas’ theory of communicative action and Luhmann’s systems theory.

=== Habermas and Rawls ===
{{Main|Habermas–Rawls debate}}
There is a debate between Habermas and [[John Rawls]].<ref>Habermas, Jürgen (1995), "Reconciliation Through the Public Use of Reason: Remarks on John Rawls’s Political Liberalism", ''Journal of Philosophy'' 92(3): 109-31.</ref><ref>Rawls, John (1995), "Political Liberalism: Reply to Habermas", ''Journal of Philosophy'' 92(3): 132–80</ref>

===''Historikerstreit'' (Historians' Quarrel)===
{{Main|Historikerstreit}}
Habermas is famous as a [[public intellectual]] as well as a scholar; most notably, in the 1980s he used the [[popular press]] to attack the German historians [[Ernst Nolte]], [[Michael Stürmer]], [[Klaus Hildebrand]] and [[Andreas Hillgruber]]. Habermas first expressed his views on the above-mentioned historians in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' on 11 July 1986 in a ''[[feuilleton]]'' (a type of culture and arts opinion essay in German newspapers) entitled "A Kind of Settlement of Damages". Habermas criticized Nolte, Hildebrand, Stürmer and Hillgruber for "apologistic" history writing in regard to the Nazi era, and for seeking to "close Germany's opening to the West" that in Habermas's view had existed since 1945.<ref>Habermas, Jürgen, "A Kind of Settlement of Damages On Apologetic Tendencies In German History Writing", pp. 34–44 from ''Forever In the Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993, p. 43.</ref>

Habermas argued that Nolte, Stürmer, Hildebrand and Hillgruber had tried to detach Nazi rule and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] from the mainstream of [[German history]], explain away Nazism as a reaction to [[Bolshevism]], and partially rehabilitate the [[reputation of the Wehrmacht]] (German Army) during [[World War II]]. Habermas wrote that Stürmer was trying to create a "vicarious religion" in German history which, together with the work of Hillgruber, glorifying the last days of the German Army on the Eastern Front, was intended to serve as a "kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism".<ref>Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages" pp. 34–44 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 42–43.</ref> About Hillgruber's statement that [[Adolf Hitler]] wanted to exterminate the Jews "because only such a 'racial revolution' could lend permanence to the world-power status of his ''Reich''", Habermas wrote: "Since Hillgruber does not use the verb in the subjunctive, one does not know whether the historian has adopted the perspective of the particulars this time too".<ref>Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages" pp. 34–44 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 37–38.</ref>

Habermas wrote: "The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about "the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe" (Stürmer) and "the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center" (Hillgruber). The only patriotism that will not estrange us from the West is a constitutional patriotism."<ref>Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 43</ref>

The so-called ''Historikerstreit'' ("Historians' Quarrel") was not at all one-sided, because Habermas was himself attacked by scholars like [[Joachim Fest]],<ref>Fest, Joachim, "Encumbered Remembrance: The Controversy about the Incomparability of National-Socialist Mass Crimes", pp. 63–71 & "Postscript, April 21, 1987", pp. 264–265 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed.

===Habermas and Derrida===
Habermas and [[Jacques Derrida]] engaged in a series of disputes beginning in the 1980s and culminating in a mutual understanding and friendship in the late 1990s that lasted until Derrida's death in 2004.<ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306">{{Citation |last=Derrida |first=J |author-link=Jacques Derrida |title=Honesty of Thought |work=The Derrida-Habermas Reader |editor=Lasse Thomassen |place=Chicago Ill |publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]] |year=2006 |page=302 |isbn=978-0-226-79683-3}}</ref> They originally came in contact when Habermas invited Derrida to speak at The University of Frankfurt in 1984. The next year Habermas published "Beyond a Temporalized Philosophy of Origins: Derrida" in ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' in which he described Derrida's method as being unable to provide a foundation for social critique.<ref>Thomassen, L. "Introduction: Between Deconstruction and Rational Reconstruction" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 1–7. P.2.</ref> Derrida, citing Habermas as an example, remarked that, "those who have accused me of reducing philosophy to literature or logic to rhetoric ... have visibly and carefully avoided reading me".<ref>Derrida, J., "Is There a Philosophical Language?" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 35–45. P.37.</ref> After Derrida's final rebuttal in 1989 the two philosophers did not continue, but, as Derrida described it, groups in the academy "conducted a kind of 'war', in which we ourselves never took part, either personally or directly".<ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"/>

At the end of the 1990s, Habermas approached Derrida at a party held at an American university where both were lecturing. They then met at Paris over dinner, and participated afterwards in many joint projects. In 2000 they held a joint seminar on problems of philosophy, right, ethics, and politics at the University of Frankfurt.<ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"/> In December 2000, in Paris, Habermas gave a lecture entitled "How to answer the ethical question?" at the ''Judeities. Questions for Jacques Derrida'' conference organized by Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. Following the lecture by Habermas, both thinkers engaged in a very heated debate on Heidegger and the possibility of Ethics. The conference volume was published at the Editions Galilée (Paris) in 2002, and subsequently in English at Fordham University Press (2007).

In the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the 11 September attacks]], Derrida and Habermas laid out their individual opinions on 9/11 and the [[War on Terror]] in [[Giovanna Borradori]]'s ''Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida''. In early 2003, both Habermas and Derrida were very active in [[Opposition to the Iraq War|opposing]] the coming [[Iraq War]]; in a manifesto that later became the book ''[[Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe]]'', the two called for a tighter unification of the states of the [[European Union]] in order to create a power capable of opposing [[American foreign policy]]. Derrida wrote a foreword expressing his unqualified subscription to Habermas's declaration of February 2003 ("February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe") in the book, which was a reaction to the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s demands upon European nations for support in the coming Iraq War.<ref>Habermas, J. and Derrida, J. "February 15, Or What Binds Europeans Together: A Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, beginning in the Core of Europe" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 270–277. P. 302.</ref> Habermas has offered further context for this declaration in an interview.{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide or specify the interview|date=December 2018}}

=== Religious dialogue ===
Habermas's attitudes toward religion have changed throughout the years. Analyst Phillippe Portier identifies three phases in Habermas's attitude towards this social sphere: the first, in the decade of 1980, when the younger Jürgen, in the spirit of Marx, argued against religion seeing it as an "alienating reality" and "control tool"; the second phase, from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 21st Century, when he stopped discussing it and, as a secular commentator, relegated it to matters of private life; and the third, from then until now, when Habermas has recognized the positive social role of religion.<ref>Sánchez, Rosalía. 2011. ''[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/10/07/cultura/1317980044.html 'San' Jürgen Habermas]''. [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]. Access date: 10 January 2015</ref>

In an interview in 1999 Habermas had stated:

{{quote|For the normative self-understanding of modernity, [[Christianity]] has functioned as more than just a precursor or catalyst. Universalistic [[egalitarianism]], from which sprang the ideals of freedom and a collective life in solidarity, the autonomous conduct of life and emancipation, the individual morality of conscience, human rights and democracy, is the direct legacy of the Judaic ethic of justice and the Christian ethic of love. This legacy, substantially unchanged, has been the object of a continual critical reappropriation and reinterpretation. Up to this very day there is no alternative to it. And in light of the current challenges of a post-national constellation, we must draw sustenance now, as in the past, from this substance. Everything else is idle postmodern talk.<ref>Habermas, Jurgen, ''Religion and Rationality: Essays on Reason, God, and Modernity'', ed. Eduardo Mendieta, MIT Press, 2002, p. 149. And Habermas, Jurgen, ''Time of Transitions'', Polity Press, 2006, pp. 150–151.</ref><ref>[http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=1342&theme=home&page=4&loc=b&type=ctbf ''First Principles Journal– Recovering the Western Soul'', Wilfred M.

The original German (from the Habermas Forum website) of the disputed quotation is:

{{quote|''Das Christentum ist für das normative Selbstverständnis der Moderne nicht nur eine Vorläufergestalt oder ein Katalysator gewesen. Der egalitäre Universalismus, aus dem die Ideen von Freiheit und solidarischem Zusammenleben, von autonomer Lebensführung und Emanzipation, von individueller Gewissensmoral, Menschenrechten und Demokratie entsprungen sind, ist unmittelbar ein Erbe der jüdischen Gerechtigkeits- und der christlichen Liebesethik. In der Substanz unverändert, ist dieses Erbe immer wieder kritisch angeeignet und neu interpretiert worden. Dazu gibt es bis heute keine Alternative. Auch angesichts der aktuellen Herausforderungen einer postnationalen Konstellation zehren wir nach wie vor von dieser Substanz. Alles andere ist postmodernes Gerede.''|author=Jürgen Habermas|source=''Zeit der Übergänge'' (2001), p.&nbsp;174f.}}

This statement has been misquoted in a number of articles and books, where Habermas instead is quoted for saying:

{{quote|Christianity, and nothing else, is the ultimate foundation of liberty, conscience, human rights, and democracy, the benchmarks of Western civilization. To this day, we have no other options. We continue to nourish ourselves from this source. Everything else is postmodern chatter.<ref>Ambrose Ih-Ren Mong. ''Dialogue Derailed: Joseph Ratzinger's War against Pluralist Theology''. Wipf and Stock Publishers. p. 279</ref>}}

In his book ''Zwischen Naturalismus und Religion'' (Between Naturalism and Religion, 2005), Habermas stated that the forces of religious strength, as a result of multiculturalism and immigration, are stronger than in previous decades, and, therefore, there is a need of tolerance which must be understood as a two-way street: [[secular]] people need to [[tolerate]] the role of religious people in the public square and vice versa.<ref>[http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php A “post-secular” society – what does that mean?] {{Webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090329090452/http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php |date= 29 March 2009 }} by Jurgen Habermas, June 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite web |first= Javier |last=Espinosa |url= http://www.uclm.es/actividades0304/seminarios/spinoza/pdf/cuadernos/22.pdf |title=The religion in the public sphere.

In early 2007, [[Ignatius Press]] published a dialogue between Habermas and the then [[Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of the [[Holy Office]] [[Joseph Ratzinger]] (elected as [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005), entitled ''[[The Dialectics of Secularization]]''. The dialogue took place on 14 January 2004 after an invitation to both thinkers by the [[Catholic Academy of Bavaria]] in Munich.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERzoAPsS9usC&q=the+Dialectics+of+Secularization&pg=PP1|title=Dialectics of Secularization: On Reason and Religion|first1=Benedikt XVI|last1=(Papst)|first2=Jürgen|last2=Habermas|date=28 October 2017|publisher=Ignatius Press|access-date=28 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1-58617-166-7}}</ref> It addressed contemporary questions such as:
* Is a public culture of [[reason]] and ordered [[liberty]] possible in our [[Post-metaphysical philosophy|post-metaphysical]] age?
* Is philosophy permanently cut adrift from its grounding in [[being]] and [[anthropology]]?
* Does this decline of rationality signal an opportunity or a deep crisis for [[religion]] itself?

In this debate a shift of Habermas became evident—in particular, his rethinking of the public role of religion. Habermas stated that he wrote as a "methodological atheist," which means that when doing philosophy or social science, he presumed nothing about particular religious beliefs. Yet while writing from this perspective his evolving position towards the role of religion in society led him to some challenging questions, and as a result conceding some ground in his dialogue with the future Pope, that would seem to have consequences which further complicated the positions he holds about a communicative rational solution to the problems of modernity. Habermas believes that even for self-identified [[Liberalism|liberal]] thinkers, "to exclude religious voices from the public square is highly [[illiberal democracy|illiberal]]."

Though, in the first period of his career, he began as a skeptic of any social usefulness of religion, he now believes there is a social role and utilitarian [[moral]] strength in religion, and notably, that there is a necessity of [[Judeochristian]] ethics in culture.<ref>Forum Libertas. 2006. ''[http://www.forumlibertas.com/frontend/forumlibertas/noticia.php?id_noticia=6908 Jürgen Habermas, pensador icono de la izquierda, reivindica el valor de la religión]''.</ref>

In addition, Habermas has popularized the concept of "[[Postsecularism|post-secular]]" society, to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as unsuccessful and at times, morally failed, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and coexistence between faith and reason must be sought in order to learn mutually.<ref>Buston, Fernando del. 2014. ''El Estado debe proteger a la religión''. El Comercio. Date access 10 January 2015: "Jürgen Habermas ha acuñado el término de postsecularidad.Se da por fallida la idea central de la modernidad de que la religión iba a desaparecer y se establece una nueva relación entre razón y religión. Habermas plantea que es necesario emprender un aprendizaje mutuo entre las sociedades modernas y las creencias, o entre razón secular y fe. Se inicia una nueva época de mutuas tolerancias. La razón no puede echar por la borda el potencial de sentido de las religiones y éstas deben traducir sus contenidos racionalmente."</ref>

===Socialist dialogue===
Habermas has sided with other 20th-century commentators on Marx such as [[Hannah Arendt]] who have indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx's apparent over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Arendt had presented this in her book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' and Habermas extends this critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action|Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason]]''. As Habermas states:

{{blockquote | …traditional Marxist analysis… today, when we use the means of the critique of political economy… can no longer make clear predictions: for that, one would still have to assume the autonomy of a self-reproducing economic system. I do not believe in such an autonomy. Precisely for this reason, the laws governing the economic system are no longer identical to the ones Marx analyzed. Of course, this does not mean that it would be wrong to analyze the mechanism which drives the economic system; but in order for the orthodox version of such an analysis to be valid, the influence of the political system would have to be ignored.<ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981" />}}Habermas reiterated the positions that what refuted [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and his theory of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] was the "pacification of class conflict" by the [[welfare state]], which had developed in the West "since 1945", thanks to "a reformist relying on the instruments of [[Keynesian economics]]".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|title=Theory of Communicative Action|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|year=1987|volume=2|pages=348|translator-last=Thomas|translator-first=McCarthy}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Losurdo|first=Domenico|title=Class Struggle|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1-137-52387-7|location=|pages=3|doi=10.1057/978-1-349-70660-0|lccn=2016940579}}</ref> Italian philosopher and historian [[Domenico Losurdo]] criticised the main point of these claims as "marked by the absence of a question that should be obvious:— Was the advent of the welfare state the inevitable result of a tendency inherent in [[capitalism]]? Or was it the result of political and social mobilization by the subaltern classes—in the final analysis, of a class struggle? Had the German philosopher posed this question, perhaps he would have avoided assuming the permanence of the welfare state, whose precariousness and progressive dismantlement are now obvious to everyone".<ref name=":0" />

=== Controversy about wars ===
In 1999, Habermas also addressed the [[Kosovo War]]. Habermas defended the NATO’s decision to intervene in an article for ''Die Zeit'', which stirred controversy.<ref>Jürgen Habermas, 'Bestialitiit und Humanitiit: Ein Krieg an der Grenze zwischen Recht und Moral', ''Die Zeit'', 29 April 1999; in English as 'Bestiality and Humanity: A War on the Border between Law and Morality', in William Buckley (ed.), ''Kosovo: Contending Voices on the Balkan Intervention'' (2000).</ref>

In 2001, Habermas argued that the United States should not go to war in [[Iraq War|Iraq]].<ref>Jürgen Habermas, "Letter to America", ''The Nation'', 16 December 2002</ref>

=== European union ===
During [[European debt crisis]], Habermas criticized [[Angela Merkel]]'s leadership in Europe, In 2013, Habermas clashed with [[Wolfgang Streeck]], who argued the kind of European federalism espoused by Habermas as the root of the continent’s crisis.<ref>Philip Oltermann, "Merkel 'gambling away' Germany's reputation over Greece, says Habermas", ''The Guardian'' (16 July, 2015)</ref>
