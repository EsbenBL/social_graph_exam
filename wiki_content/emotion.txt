Research on emotion has increased over the past two decades with many fields contributing including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[history]], [[sociology of emotions]], and [[computer science]]. The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, [[functional accounts of emotion|function]] and other aspects of emotions have fostered more intense research on this topic. Current areas of research in the concept of emotion include the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion. In addition, [[positron emission tomography|PET]] scans and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] scans help study the [[International Affective Picture System|affective picture]] processes in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.191|title=Emotion|year=1999|last1=Cacioppo|first1=John T.|last2=Gardner|first2=Wendi L.|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=50|pages=191–214|pmid=10074678}}</ref>

From a mechanistic perspective, emotions can be defined as "a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity." Emotions produce different physiological, behavioral and cognitive changes. The original role of emotions was to motivate adaptive behaviors that in the past would have contributed to the passing on of genes through survival, reproduction, and kin selection.<ref>Schacter, D.L., Gilbert, D.T., Wegner, D.M., & Hood, B.M. (2011). Psychology (European ed.). Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.</ref><ref>{{citation|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How the Mind Works|pages=342|year=1997|place=New York|publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]]|title-link=How the Mind Works}}</ref>

In some theories, [[cognition]] is an important aspect of emotion. Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition. Consciously experiencing an emotion is exhibiting a mental representation of that emotion from a past or hypothetical experience, which is linked back to a content state of pleasure or displeasure.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson TD, Dunn EW |s2cid=14379927 |title=Self-knowledge: its limits, value, and potential for improvement |journal=[[Annual Review of Psychology]] |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=493–518 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14744224 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141954 }}</ref> The content states are established by verbal explanations of experiences, describing an internal state.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrett LF, Mesquita B, Ochsner KN, Gross JJ |title=The experience of emotion |journal=[[Annual Review of Psychology]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=373–403 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17002554 |pmc=1934613 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085709 }}</ref>

Emotions are complex. There are various theories on the question of whether or not emotions cause changes in our behaviour.<ref name="Schacter">{{cite book |last=Scirst=Daniel L. |title=Psychology Second Edition |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location= New York |isbn=978-1429237192 |page=[https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha/page/310 310] |url=https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha/page/310}}</ref> On the one hand, the [[physiology]] of emotion is closely linked to [[arousal]] of the [[nervous system]]. Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency. Extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions. Emotion is often the driving force behind [[motivation]].<ref name="Gaulin 6">Gaulin, Steven J.C. and Donald H. McBurney (2003). ''Evolutionary Psychology''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|978-0131115293}}, Chapter 6, pp. 121–42.</ref> On the other hand, emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components, which might include motivation, feeling, behaviour, and physiological changes, but none of these components is the emotion. Nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components.<ref name="Barrett & Russell">{{cite book |vauthors=Barrett LF, Russell JA |title=The psychological construction of emotion. |publisher=Guilford Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1462516971 }}</ref>

Emotions involve different components, such as subjective experience, [[cognition|cognitive process]]es, expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior. At one time, academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components: [[William James]] with a subjective experience, [[behaviorism|behaviorist]]s with instrumental behavior, [[psychophysiology|psychophysiologist]]s with physiological changes, and so on. More recently, emotion is said to consist of all the components. The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. In [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], emotion typically includes a [[subjectivity|subjective]], [[consciousness|conscious]] [[qualia|experience]] characterized primarily by [[psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] [[emotional expression|expression]]s, [[metabolism|biological reaction]]s, and [[mental state]]s. A similar multi-componential description of emotion is found in [[sociology]]. For example, Peggy Thoits<ref name="Thoits, P. A. 1989">{{cite journal |vauthors=Thoits PA |year=1989 |title=The sociology of emotions |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=15 |pages=317–42 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.15.1.317}}</ref> described emotions as involving physiological components, cultural or emotional labels (anger, surprise, etc.), expressive body actions, and the appraisal of situations and contexts.

The word "emotion" dates back to 1579, when it was adapted from the French word ''émouvoir'', which means "to stir up". The term emotion was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to [[passions (philosophy)|passion]]s, [[feeling|sentiment]]s and [[affection]]s.<ref name="Dixon, Thomas">Dixon, Thomas. From passions to emotions: the creation of a secular psychological category. Cambridge University Press. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0521026697}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9c8tNQVI4YC link].</ref> The word "emotion" was coined in the early 1800s by Thomas Brown and it is around the 1830s that the modern concept of emotion first emerged for the English language.<ref name="Smith Human Emotions">{{cite book |title=The Book of Human Emotions |last1=Smith |first1=Tiffany Watt |date=2015 |publisher=Little, Brown, and Company |isbn=978-0316265409 |pages=4–7 |name-list-style=vanc}}</ref> "No one felt emotions before about 1830. Instead they felt other things – 'passions', 'accidents of the soul', 'moral sentiments' – and explained them very differently from how we understand emotions today."<ref name="Smith Human Emotions" />

Some cross-cultural studies indicate that the categorization of "emotion" and classification of basic emotions such as "anger" and "sadness" are not universal and that the boundaries and domains of these concepts are categorized differently by all cultures.<ref name="Russell">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell JA |s2cid=4830394 |date=November 1991 |title=Culture and the categorization of emotions |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=110 |issue=3 |pages=426–50 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.110.3.426 |pmid=1758918}}</ref> However, others argue that there are some universal bases of emotions (see Section 6.1).<ref name="Wierzbicka, Anna">Wierzbicka, Anna.

== History ==
Human nature and the following bodily sensations have been always part of the interest of thinkers and philosophers. Far most extensively, this interest has been of great interest by both Western and Eastern societies. Emotional states have been associated with the divine and the enlightenment of the human mind and body.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kagan|first=Jerome|title=What is emotion?: History, measures, and meanings|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|pages=10, 11}}</ref> The ever-changing actions of individuals and its mood variations have been of great importance by most of the Western philosophers (Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Aquinas, Hobbes) that lead them to propose vast theories; often competing theories, that sought to explain the emotion and the following motivators of human action and its consequences.

In the Age of Enlightenment Scottish thinker [[David Hume]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Mossner|first=Ernest Campbell|title=The Life of David Hume|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|pages=2}}</ref> proposed a revolutionary argument that sought to explain the main motivators of human action and conduct. He proposed that actions are motivated by "fears, desires, and passions". As he wrote in his book Treatise of Human Nature (1773): "Reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will… it can never oppose passion in the direction of the will… The reason is, and ought to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hume|first=David|title=A treatise of human nature|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2003}}</ref> With these lines Hume pretended to explain that reason and further action will be subjected to the desires and experience of the self. Later thinkers would propose that actions and emotions are deeply interrelated to social, political, historical, and cultural aspects of reality that would be also associated with sophisticated neurological and physiological research on the brain and other parts of the physical body & its nature.

== Definitions ==
The [[Lexico]] definition of emotion is "A strong [[feeling]] deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/emotion|title=Emotion &#124; Definition of Emotion by Oxford Dictionary on Lexico.com also meaning of Emotion|website=Lexico Dictionaries &#124; English}}</ref> Emotions are responses to significant internal and external events.<ref>Schacter, D.L., Gilbert, D.T., Wegner, D.M., & Hood, B.M. (2011). ''Psychology'' (European ed.). Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.</ref>

Emotions can be occurrences (e.g., [[panic]]) or dispositions (e.g., hostility), and short-lived (e.g., anger) or long-lived (e.g., grief).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2018 |chapter=Emotion |chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotion/#DefiEmotWhatDesi}}</ref> Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment |last1=Graham |first1=Michael C. |date=2014 |publisher=Outskirts Press |isbn=978-1478722595 |page=63 |name-list-style=vanc}}</ref> Thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts of Life: Ten Issues of Contentment |last1=Graham |first1=Michael C. |date=2014 |publisher=Outskirts Press |isbn=978-1478722595 |name-list-style=vanc}}</ref> Emotions have been described as consisting of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, [[physiology|physiological]], behavioral, and [[nervous system|neural]] mechanisms.{{sfn|Fox|2008|pp=16–17}}

Emotions have been [[emotion classification#Lists of emotions|categorize]]d, with some relationships existing between emotions and some direct opposites existing. Graham differentiates emotions as functional or dysfunctional and argues all functional emotions have benefits.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment |last1=Graham |first1=Michael C. |date=2014 |publisher=Outskirts Press |isbn=978-1478722595 |name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>

In some uses of the word, emotions are intense feelings that are directed at someone or something.<ref name="ReferenceA">Hume, D. Emotions and Moods. Organizational Behavior, 258–97.</ref> On the other hand, emotion can be used to refer to states that are mild (as in annoyed or content) and to states that are not directed at anything (as in anxiety and depression). One line of research looks at the meaning of the word emotion in everyday language and finds that this usage is rather different from that in academic discourse.<ref name="Fehr & Russell">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fehr B, Russell JA |year=1984 |title=Concept of Emotion Viewed from a Prototype Perspective |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=464–86 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.113.3.464}}</ref>

In practical terms, [[Joseph E. LeDoux|Joseph LeDoux]] has defined emotions as the result of a cognitive and conscious process which occurs in response to a body system response to a trigger.<ref name=LeDoux>{{cite web |url=https://brainworldmagazine.com/on-fear-emotions-and-memory-an-interview-with-dr-joseph-ledoux/2/ |title=On Fear, Emotions, and Memory: An Interview with Dr. Joseph LeDoux – Page 2 of 2 – Brain World |date=2018-06-06}}</ref>

== Components ==
According to [[Klaus Scherer|Scherer]]'s Component Process Model (CPM) of emotion,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scherer KR |s2cid=145575751 |title=What are emotions? And how can they be measured? |journal=Social Science Information |year=2005 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=693–727 |doi=10.1177/0539018405058216}}</ref> there are five crucial elements of emotion. From the component process perspective, emotional experience requires that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time, driven by appraisal processes. Although the inclusion of [[cognitive appraisal]] as one of the elements is slightly controversial, since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and [[cognition]] are separate but interacting systems, the CPM provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode.
* ''Cognitive appraisal'': provides an evaluation of events and objects.
* ''Bodily symptoms'': the [[physiology|physiological]] component of emotional experience.
* ''Action tendencies'': a [[motivation]]al component for the preparation and direction of motor responses.
* ''Expression'': [[facial expression|facial]] and [[human voice|vocal]] expression almost always accompanies an emotional state to communicate reaction and intention of actions.
* ''Feelings'': the subjective experience of emotional state once it has occurred.

== Purpose and value ==
One view is that emotions [[functional accounts of emotion|facilitate adaptive responses to environmental challenge]]s. Emotions have been described as a result of [[evolution]] because they provided good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced our ancestors.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ekman |first=Paul |name-list-style=vanc |title=An argument for basic emotions |journal=Cognition & Emotion |year=1992 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=169–200 |doi=10.1080/02699939208411068 |url=http://www.emotional.economics.uni-mainz.de/Dateien/Ekman_1992_Psy_Review_Basic_Emotions.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.454.1984 |access-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015022148/http://www.emotional.economics.uni-mainz.de/Dateien/Ekman_1992_Psy_Review_Basic_Emotions.pdf |archive-date=15 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Emotions can function as a way to communicate what's important to individuals, such as values and ethics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/finding-your-authentic-pu_b_8342280 |title=Listening to Your Authentic Self: The Purpose of Emotions |date=2015-10-21 |website=HuffPost |access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref> However some emotions, such as some forms of [[anxiety]], are sometimes regarded as part of a [[mental disorder|mental illness]] and thus possibly of negative value.<ref>Some people regard mental illnesses as having evolutionary value, see e.g. [[evolutionary approaches to depression]].</ref>

== Classification ==
{{main|Emotion classification}}
A distinction can be made between emotional episodes and emotional dispositions. Emotional dispositions are also comparable to character traits, where someone may be said to be generally disposed to experience certain emotions. For example, an irritable person is generally disposed to feel [[irritation]] more easily or quickly than others do. Finally, some theorists place emotions within a more general category of "affective states" where affective states can also include emotion-related phenomena such as [[pleasure]] and [[suffering|pain]], motivational states (for example, [[hunger (physiology)|hunger]] or [[curiosity]]), moods, dispositions and traits.<ref>Schwarz, N.H. (1990). "Feelings as information: Informational and motivational functions of affective states". ''Handbook of motivation and cognition: Foundations of social behavior'', 2, 527–61.{{ISBN?}}</ref>

=== Basic emotions ===
[[File:Emotions - 3.svg|thumb|Examples of basic emotions]]
[[File:Plutchik-wheel.svg|left|thumb|The emotion wheel.]]
For more than 40 years, [[Paul Ekman]] has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. Ekman's most influential work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media. Another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (for example, disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. Ekman's facial-expression research examined six basic emotions: [[anger]], [[disgust]], [[fear]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]] and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Shiota |first=Michelle N. |date=2016 |chapter=Ekman's theory of basic emotions |editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Harold L. |title=The Sage encyclopedia of theory in psychology |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7C45DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA248 248–50] |isbn=978-1452256719 |doi=10.4135/9781483346274.n85 |quote=Some aspects of Ekman's approach to basic emotions are commonly misunderstood. Three misinterpretations are especially common. The first and most widespread is that Ekman posits exactly six basic emotions. Although his original facial-expression research examined six emotions, Ekman has often written that evidence may eventually be found for several more and has suggested as many as 15 likely candidates.}}</ref>

Later in his career,<ref name="Ekman and Cordaro">{{cite journal |last1=Ekman |first1=Paul |last2=Cordaro |first2=Daniel |s2cid=52833124 |title=What is Meant by Calling Emotions Basic |journal=Emotion Review |date=20 September 2011 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=364–70 |doi=10.1177/1754073911410740 |issn=1754-0739}}</ref> Ekman theorized that other universal emotions may exist beyond these six. In light of this, recent cross-cultural studies led by [[Daniel Cordaro]] and [[Dacher Keltner]], both former students of Ekman, extended the list of universal emotions. In addition to the original six, these studies provided evidence for [[amusement]], [[awe]], [[contentment]], [[desire]], [[embarrassment]], [[pain]], [[relief]], and [[sympathy]] in both facial and vocal expressions. They also found evidence for [[boredom]], [[confusion]], [[interest (emotion)|interest]], [[pride]], and [[shame]] facial expressions, as well as [[contempt]], [[relief]], and [[wikt:triumph|triumph]] vocal expressions.<ref name="Cordaro, Keltner, Tshering, Wangchuk and Flynn">{{cite journal |last1=Cordaro |first1=Daniel T. |last2=Keltner |first2=Dacher |last3=Tshering |first3=Sumjay |last4=Wangchuk |first4=Dorji |last5=Flynn |first5=Lisa M. |title=The voice conveys emotion in ten globalized cultures and one remote village in Bhutan. |journal=Emotion |date=2016 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=117–28 |doi=10.1037/emo0000100 |pmid=26389648 |language=en |issn=1931-1516}}</ref><ref name="Cordaro, Sun, Keltner, Kamble and Huddar and McNeil">{{cite journal |last1=Cordaro |first1=Daniel T. |last2=Sun |first2=Rui |last3=Keltner |first3=Dacher |last4=Kamble |first4=Shanmukh |last5=Huddar |first5=Niranjan |last6=McNeil |first6=Galen |s2cid=3436764 |title=Universals and cultural variations in 22 emotional expressions across five cultures. |journal=Emotion |date=February 2018 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=75–93 |doi=10.1037/emo0000302 |pmid=28604039 |language=en |issn=1931-1516}}</ref><ref name="Keltner, Oatley and Jenkins">{{cite book |last1=Keltner |first1=Dacher |last2=Oatley |first2=Keith |last3=Jenkins |first3=Jennifer M |title=Understanding emotions |date=2019 |isbn=978-1119492535 |language=en |oclc=1114474792 }}{{page needed|date=July 2021}}</ref>

[[Robert Plutchik]] agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the "[[emotion classification#Plutchik's wheel of emotions|wheel of emotions]]", suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plutchik |first=Robert |date=2000 |title=Emotions in the practice of psychotherapy: clinical implications of affect theories |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |isbn=1557986940 |oclc=44110498 |doi=10.1037/10366-000}}</ref> Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way [[primary color]]s combine, ''primary emotions'' could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal [[anger]] and [[disgust]] could blend to form [[contempt]]. Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Plutchik R |year=2002 |title=Nature of emotions |journal=American Scientist |volume=89 |issue=4 |page=349 |doi=10.1511/2001.28.739}}</ref>

[[Jaak Panksepp]] carved out seven [[heredity|biologically inherited]] [[primary affective systems]] called SEEKING (expectancy), FEAR (anxiety), RAGE (anger), LUST (sexual excitement), CARE (nurturance), PANIC/GRIEF (sadness), and PLAY (social joy). He proposed what is known as "core-SELF" to be generating these affects.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Panksepp|first1=Jaak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVdxXN_vVGEC&q=at+least+seven+basic+affective+systems|title=The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotions (Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology)|last2=Biven|first2=Lucy|year=2012|publisher=W.

=== Pre-modern history ===
In [[Buddhism]], emotions occur when an object is considered as attractive or repulsive. There is a felt tendency impelling people towards attractive objects and impelling them to move away from repulsive or harmful objects; a disposition to possess the object (greed), to destroy it (hatred), to flee from it (fear), to get obsessed or worried over it (anxiety), and so on.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Emotions in Buddhist Perspective|vauthors=de Silva P |year= 1976|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/desilva-p/wheel237.html}}</ref>

In [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theories, normal emotions (like delight and fear) are described as irrational impulses which come from incorrect appraisals of what is 'good' or 'bad'. Alternatively, there are 'good emotions' (like joy and caution) experienced by those that are wise, which come from correct appraisals of what is 'good' and 'bad'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arius Didymus |title="Epitome of Stoic Ethics" in the Anthology of Stobaeus |at=Book 2.

[[Aristotle]] believed that emotions were an essential component of [[virtue]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Nicomachean Ethics |at=Book 2. Chapter 6 |url=http://www.constitution.org/ari/ethic_02.htm#2.6}}</ref> In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the [[Middle Ages]], the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by [[scholasticism]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |name-list-style=vanc |title=Summa Theologica |at=Q.59, Art.2 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2059.htm}}</ref> in particular.

In Chinese antiquity, excessive emotion was believed to cause damage to ''[[qi]]'', which in turn, damages the vital organs.<ref name="Suchy 2011">{{cite book |last=Suchy |first=Yana |name-list-style=vanc |title=Clinical neuropsychology of emotion |year=2011 |publisher=Guilford |location=New York, NY}}</ref> The [[four humours]] theory made popular by [[Hippocrates]] contributed to the study of emotion in the same way that it did for [[medicine]].

In the early 11th century, [[Avicenna]] theorized about the influence of emotions on health and behaviors, suggesting the need to manage emotions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haque |first=Amber |s2cid=38740431 |name-list-style=vanc |date=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |jstor=27512819 |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–77 |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}</ref>

Early modern views on emotion are developed in the works of philosophers such as [[René Descartes]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Baruch Spinoza]],<ref>See for instance Antonio Damasio (2005) ''Looking for Spinoza''.</ref> [[Thomas Hobbes]]<ref>Leviathan (1651), VI: Of the Interior Beginnings of Voluntary Notions, Commonly called the Passions; and the Speeches by which They are Expressed</ref> and [[David Hume]]. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an [[empiricism|empiricist]] psychiatric perspective.

=== Western theological ===
Christian perspective on emotion presupposes a theistic origin to humanity. God who created humans gave humans the ability to feel emotion and interact emotionally. Biblical content expresses that God is a person who feels and expresses emotion. Though a somatic view would place the locus of emotions in the physical body, Christian theory of emotions would view the body more as a platform for the sensing and expression of emotions. Therefore emotions themselves arise from the person, or that which is "imago-dei" or [[Image of God]] in humans. In Christian thought, emotions have the potential to be controlled through reasoned reflection. That reasoned reflection also mimics God who made mind. The purpose of emotions in human life are therefore summarized in God's call to enjoy Him and creation, humans are to enjoy emotions and benefit from them and use them to energize behavior.

=== Evolutionary theories ===
{{main|Evolution of emotion|Evolutionary psychology}}
[[File:Expression of the Emotions Figure 15.png|thumb|Illustration from [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' (1872)]]

==== 19th century ====
Perspectives on emotions from evolutionary theory were initiated during the mid-late 19th century with [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.<ref>Darwin, Charles (1872). ''The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals''. Note: This book was originally published in 1872, but has been reprinted many times thereafter by different publishers</ref> Darwin argued that emotions served no evolved purpose for humans, neither in communication, nor in aiding survival.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hess |first1=Ursula |last2=Thibault |s2cid=31276371 |title=Darwin & Emotion Expression |date=2009 |department=The Principle of Serviceable Habits |journal=American Psychologist |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=120–28 |doi=10.1037/a0013386 |pmid=19203144 |quote=for most emotion expressions, Darwin insisted that they were functional in the past or were functional in animals but not in humans.}}</ref> Darwin largely argued that emotions evolved via the inheritance of acquired characters.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rupert |last=Sheldrake |url=http://opensciences.org/blogs/open-sciences-blog/darwinian-inheritance-and-the-evolution-of-evolutionary-theory |title=Darwinian Inheritance & the Evolution of Evolutionary Theory |date=2015-06-08 |website=OpenSciences.org |access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref> He pioneered various methods for studying non-verbal expressions, from which he concluded that some expressions had [[cross-cultural]] universality. Darwin also detailed homologous expressions of emotions that [[emotion in animals|occur in animals]]. This led the way for animal research on emotions and the eventual determination of the neural underpinnings of emotion.

==== Contemporary ====
More contemporary views along the [[evolutionary psychology]] spectrum posit that both basic emotions and social emotions evolved to motivate (social) behaviors that were adaptive in the ancestral environment.<ref name="Gaulin 6"/> Emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems.<ref name="pmid25251484">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lerner JS, Li Y, Valdesolo P, Kassam KS |title=Emotion and decision making |journal=[[Annual Review of Psychology]] |volume=66 |pages=799–823 |date=January 2015 |pmid=25251484 |doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115043 |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jenniferlerner/files/annual_review_manuscript_june_16_final.final_.pdf }}</ref> Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on one hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand. The increased potential in [[neuroimaging]] has also allowed investigation into evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain. Important neurological advances were derived from these perspectives in the 1990s by [[Joseph E. LeDoux]] and [[Antonio Damasio]].

Research on social emotion also focuses on the physical displays of emotion including body language of animals and humans (see [[affect display]]). For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.<ref name="Gaulin 6"/> Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.<ref name="Gaulin 6"/><ref>Wright, Robert. Moral animal.</ref>

=== Somatic theories ===
[[Somatic marker hypothesis|Somatic]] theories of emotion claim that bodily responses, rather than cognitive interpretations, are essential to emotions. The first modern version of such theories came from [[William James]] in the 1880s. The theory lost favor in the 20th century, but has regained popularity more recently due largely to theorists such as [[John T. Cacioppo]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cacioppo JT |year=1998 |title=Somatic responses to psychological stress: The reactivity hypothesis |journal=Advances in Psychological Science |volume=2 |pages=87–114 }}</ref> [[Antonio Damasio]],<ref name="pmid18472250">{{cite journal |vauthors=Aziz-Zadeh L, Damasio A |s2cid=44371175 |title=Embodied semantics for actions: findings from functional brain imaging |journal=Journal of Physiology, Paris |volume=102 |issue=1–3 |pages=35–39 |date=2008 |pmid=18472250 |doi=10.1016/j.jphysparis.2008.03.012 }}</ref> [[Joseph E.

==== James–Lange theory ====
{{main|James–Lange theory}}
[[File:James-Lange Theory of Emotion.png|thumb|357x357px|Simplified graph of James-Lange Theory of Emotion]]
In his 1884 article<ref name="James">{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=William |name-list-style=vanc |author-link=William James |year=1884 |title=What Is an Emotion? |url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/emotion.htm |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=9 |issue=34 |pages=188–205 |doi=10.1093/mind/os-ix.34.188}}</ref> [[William James]] argued that feelings and emotions were ''secondary'' to [[physiology|physiological]] phenomena. In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an "exciting fact" directly led to a physiological response, known as "emotion."<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil |name-list-style=vanc |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson |series=Emotion |volume=11th edition |year=2012 |page=388 |isbn=978-0205239399}}</ref> To account for different types of emotional experiences,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-26|title=Different Types of Emotions in Psychology All Questions Answered|url=https://www.calmsage.com/different-types-of-basic-emotions/|access-date=2021-06-08|website=Calm Sage – Your Guide to Mental and Emotional Well-being|language=en-US}}</ref> James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the [[autonomic nervous system]], which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist [[Carl Lange (physician)|Carl Lange]] also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the [[James–Lange theory]]. As James wrote, "the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, ''is'' the emotion." James further claims that "we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and either we cry, strike, or tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be."<ref name=James/>

An example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear). This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state.<ref name="Laird">Laird, James, ''Feelings: the Perception of Self'', Oxford University Press</ref> Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions, for example, "I'm crying because I'm sad," or "I ran away because I was scared." The issue with the James–Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being ''a priori''), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reisenzein R |year=1995 |title=James and the physical basis of emotion: A comment on Ellsworth |journal=Psychological Review |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=757–61 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.102.4.757 }}</ref>

Although mostly abandoned in its original form, Tim Dalgleish argues that most contemporary neuroscientists have embraced the components of the James-Lange theory of emotions.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dalgleish T |s2cid=148864726 |year=2004 |title=The emotional brain|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=582–89 |doi=10.1038/nrn1432 |pmid=15208700 }}</ref>

{{quote|The James–Lange theory has remained influential. Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity. Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified James–Lange view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion. (p. 583)}}

==== Cannon–Bard theory ====
{{main|Cannon–Bard theory}}
[[Walter Bradford Cannon]] agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain [[subjectivity|subjective]] emotional experiences. He argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil |name-list-style=vanc |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson |series=Emotion |edition=11th |year=2012 |page=389 |isbn=978-0205239399}}</ref> He also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses.<ref name="Cannon 1929 399–421">{{cite journal |last=Cannon |first=Walter B. |name-list-style=vanc |title=Organization for Physiological Homeostasis |journal=Physiological Reviews |year=1929 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=399–421 |doi=10.1152/physrev.1929.9.3.399}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Cannon |first=Walter B. |name-list-style=vanc |title=The James-Lange theory of emotion: A critical examination and an alternative theory. |journal=The American Journal of Psychology |year=1927 |volume=39 |issue=1/4 |pages=106–24 |doi=10.2307/1415404 |jstor=1415404}}</ref> An example of this theory in action is as follows: An emotion-evoking event (snake) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion.

Phillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. Bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the [[diencephalon]] (particularly the [[thalamus]]), before being subjected to any further processing. Therefore, Cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.<ref name="Cannon 1929 399–421"/>

==== Two-factor theory ====
{{main|Two-factor theory of emotion}}
[[Stanley Schachter]] formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, [[Gregorio Marañón]], who injected patients with [[adrenaline|epinephrine]] and subsequently asked them how they felt. Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Daniel L. |last1=Schacter |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel M. |last3=Wegner |title=Psychology |url=https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-1429237192 }}</ref> With his student, [[Jerome E. Singer|Jerome Singer]], Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) ''Gut Reactions''.<ref name="Prinz2004">{{cite book |last=Prinz |first=Jesse J. |title=Gut Reactions: A Perceptual Theory of Emotion |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0195348590}}</ref>

=== Cognitive theories ===
With the two-factor theory now incorporating cognition, several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts were entirely necessary for an emotion to occur. One of the main proponents of this view was [[Richard Lazarus]] who argued that emotions must have some cognitive [[intentionality]]. The cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing.

Lazarus' theory is very influential; emotion is a disturbance that occurs in the following order:
# Cognitive appraisal – The individual assesses the event cognitively, which cues the emotion.
# Physiological changes – The cognitive reaction starts biological changes such as increased heart rate or pituitary adrenal response.
# Action – The individual feels the emotion and chooses how to react.

For example: Jenny sees a snake.
# Jenny cognitively assesses the snake in her presence. Cognition allows her to understand it as a danger.
# Her brain activates the adrenal glands which pump adrenaline through her blood stream, resulting in increased heartbeat.
# Jenny screams and runs away.

Lazarus stressed that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled through cognitive processes. These processes underline coping strategies that form the emotional reaction by altering the relationship between the person and the environment.

[[George Mandler]] provided an extensive theoretical and empirical discussion of emotion as influenced by cognition, consciousness, and the autonomic nervous system in two books (''Mind and Emotion'', 1975,<ref>{{cite book |last=Mandler |first=George |title=Mind and Emotion |year=1975 |publisher=R.E. Krieger Publishing Company |location=Malabar |isbn=978-0898743500}}</ref> and ''Mind and Body: Psychology of Emotion and Stress'', 1984<ref>{{cite book |last=Mandler |first=George |title=Mind and Body: Psychology of Emotion and Stress |year=1984 |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |oclc=797330039}}</ref>)

There are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts are necessary in order for an emotion to occur. A prominent philosophical exponent is [[Robert C. Solomon]] (for example, ''The Passions, Emotions and the Meaning of Life'', 1993<ref>{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=Robert C. |title=The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life |url=https://archive.org/details/passions00robe |url-access=registration |year=1993 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |location=Indianapolis |isbn=0872202267}}</ref>). Solomon claims that emotions are judgments. He has put forward a more nuanced view which responds to what he has called the 'standard objection' to cognitivism, the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion, so judgment cannot be identified with emotion. The theory proposed by [[Nico Frijda]] where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example.

It has also been suggested that emotions (affect heuristics, feelings and gut-feeling reactions) are often used as shortcuts to process information and influence behavior.<ref>see the Heuristic–Systematic Model, or HSM, (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989) under [[attitude change]]. Also see the index entry for "Emotion" in "Beyond Rationality: The Search for Wisdom in a Troubled Time" by Kenneth R. Hammond and in "Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</ref> The [[affect infusion model]] (AIM) is a theoretical model developed by Joseph Forgas in the early 1990s that attempts to explain how emotion and mood interact with one's ability to process information.

;Perceptual theory
Theories dealing with perception either use one or multiples perceptions in order to find an emotion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goldie |first1=Peter |year=2007 |title=Emotion |journal=Philosophy Compass |volume=1 |issue=6 |page=6 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-9991.2007.00105.x}}</ref> A recent hybrid of the somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is the perceptual theory. This theory is neo-Jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories. The novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning. Rather the bodily changes themselves ''perceive'' the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations. In this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways. A sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book ''Gut Reactions'',<ref name="Prinz2004"/> and psychologist James Laird's book ''Feelings''.<ref name="Laird"/>

;Affective events theory
[[Affective events theory]] is a communication-based theory developed by Howard M. Weiss and Russell Cropanzano (1996),<ref>Weiss HM, Cropanzano R. (1996). Affective events theory: a theoretical discussion of the structure, causes and consequences of affective experiences at work. ''Research in Organizational Behavior'' 8: 1±74</ref> that looks at the causes, structures, and consequences of emotional experience (especially in work contexts). This theory suggests that emotions are influenced and caused by events which in turn influence attitudes and behaviors. This theoretical frame also emphasizes ''time'' in that human beings experience what they call emotion episodes –\ a "series of emotional states extended over time and organized around an underlying theme." This theory has been utilized by numerous researchers to better understand emotion from a communicative lens, and was reviewed further by Howard M. Weiss and Daniel J. Beal in their article, "Reflections on Affective Events Theory", published in ''Research on Emotion in Organizations'' in 2005.<ref>{{cite book |title=reflections on affective events theory |author1=Howard M Weiss |author2=Daniel J Beal |journal=Emotion |date=June 2005 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=1–21 |doi=10.1016/S1746-9791(05)01101-6 |series=Research on Emotion in Organizations |isbn=978-0762312344 }}</ref>

=== Situated perspective on emotion ===
A situated perspective on emotion, developed by Paul E. Griffiths and Andrea Scarantino, emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the [[situationism (psychology)|situationism]] approach in psychology.<ref>Griffiths, Paul Edmund and Scarantino, Andrea (2005) Emotions in the wild: The situated perspective on emotion.</ref> This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion. In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world. Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals.

=== Genetics ===
Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic [[physiology]], particularly with the [[stress (biology)|stress]] systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional [[phenotype]] [[temperament]]s affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kotrschal |first=Kurt |editor1-last=Watanabe |editor1-first=Shigeru |editor2-last=Kuczaj |editor2-first=Stan A. |title=Emotions of Animals and Humans: Comparative Perspectives |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3-Tjx9yKZMC&pg=PA4 |chapter=Emotions are at the core of individual social performance |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media |isbn=978-4431541226 |page=4 |access-date=2019-07-08 |quote=emotional phenotype ('temperament') affects social connectedness, 'social efficiency' and finally, fitness, in complex social systems.}}</ref> These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of [[gene]]s and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. [[Zygote]]s require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every [[speciation]] event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring.

In the five million years since the [[lineage (evolution)|lineage]]s leading to modern humans and [[pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In [[vole]]s (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a [[vasopressin receptor]] gene that corresponds to major species differences in [[social organization]] and the [[mating system]].<ref name="HammockYoung2005"/> Another potential example with behavioral differences is the [[FOXP2|FOCP2]] gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling [[speech]] and [[language]].<ref name="Vargha-Khademetal2005"/> Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans.<ref name="Enardetal2002"/> Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.

=== Neurobiological explanation ===
Based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the [[limbic system]], the [[neuroscience|neurobiological]] explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the mammalian [[brain]]. If distinguished from reactive responses of [[reptile]]s, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general [[vertebrate]] arousal patterns, in which [[neurochemical]]s (for example, [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine|noradrenaline]], and [[serotonin]]) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures and postures. Emotions can likely be mediated by [[pheromone]]s (see [[fear]]).<ref name="Givens">{{cite web |last=Givens |first=David B. |name-list-style=vanc |title=Emotion |url=http://center-for-nonverbal-studies.org/htdocs/emotion.htm |work=Center for Nonverbal Studies |access-date=7 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523192511/http://center-for-nonverbal-studies.org/emotion.htm |archive-date=23 May 2014 }}</ref>

For example, the emotion of [[love]] is proposed to be the expression of Paleocircuits of the mammalian brain (specifically, modules of the [[cingulate cortex]] (or gyrus)) which facilitate the care, feeding, and grooming of offspring. Paleocircuits are neural platforms for bodily expression configured before the advent of [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[neural circuit|circuit]]s for speech. They consist of pre-configured pathways or networks of [[neuron|nerve cell]]s in the [[forebrain]], [[brainstem]] and [[spinal cord]].

Other emotions like fear and anxiety long thought to be exclusively generated by the most primitive parts of the brain (stem) and more associated to the fight-or-flight responses of behavior, have also been associated as adaptive expressions of defensive behavior whenever a threat is encountered. Although defensive behaviors have been present in a wide variety of species, Blanchard et al. (2001) discovered a correlation of given stimuli and situation that resulted in a similar pattern of defensive behavior towards a threat in human and non-human mammals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Caroline Blanchard|first1=D|last2=Hynd|first2=April L|last3=Minke|first3=Karl A|last4=Minemoto|first4=Tiffanie|last5=Blanchard|first5=Robert J|s2cid=24732701|date=2001-12-01|title=Human defensive behaviors to threat scenarios show parallels to fear- and anxiety-related defense patterns of non-human mammals|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763401000562|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|language=en|volume=25|issue=7|pages=761–70|doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(01)00056-2|pmid=11801300|issn=0149-7634}}</ref>

Whenever potentially dangerous stimuli is presented additional brain structures activate that previously thought (hippocampus, thalamus, etc). Thus, giving the amygdala an important role on coordinating the following behavioral input based on the presented neurotransmitters that respond to threat stimuli. These biological functions of the amygdala are not only limited to the "fear-conditioning" and "processing of aversive stimuli", but also are present on other components of the amygdala. Therefore, it can referred the amygdala as a key structure to understand the potential responses of behavior in danger like situations in human and non-human mammals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Steimer|first=Thierry|date=2002|title=The biology of fear-and anxiety-related behaviors|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=4|issue=3|pages=231–49|doi=10.31887/DCNS.2002.4.3/tsteimer|pmid=22033741|pmc=3181681}}</ref>

The motor centers of [[reptile]]s react to sensory cues of vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures. With the arrival of night-active [[mammal]]s, smell replaced vision as the dominant sense, and a different way of responding arose from the [[sense of smell|olfactory]] sense, which is proposed to have developed into [[mammal]]ian emotion and emotional memory. The mammalian brain invested heavily in [[sense of smell|olfaction]] to succeed at night as reptiles slept – one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles. These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.<ref name="Givens"/>

Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by [[Paul Broca]] (1878),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Broca |first=P. |title=Anatomie comparée des circonvolutions cérébrales: le grande lobe limbique et la scissure limbique dans la série des mammifères |journal=Rev d'Anthropol. |year=1878 |number=1 |pages=385–498}}</ref> [[James Papez]] (1937),<ref>{{cite journal |title=A proposed mechanism of emotion. 1937 [classical article] |journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=7 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=103–12 |issn=0895-0172 |doi=10.1176/jnp.7.1.103 |pmid=7711480 |last1=Papez |first1=J.

More recent research has shown that some of these [[limbic system|limbic structure]]s are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.

==== Prefrontal cortex ====
There is ample evidence that the left [[prefrontal cortex]] is activated by stimuli that cause positive approach.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kringelbach ML, O'Doherty J, Rolls ET, Andrews C |title=Activation of the human orbitofrontal cortex to a liquid food stimulus is correlated with its subjective pleasantness |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1064–71 |date=October 2003 |pmid=12967923 |doi=10.1093/cercor/13.10.1064 |citeseerx=10.1.1.67.541 }}</ref> If attractive stimuli can selectively activate a region of the brain, then logically the converse should hold, that selective activation of that region of the brain should cause a stimulus to be judged more positively.

Two neurobiological models of emotion in the prefrontal cortex made opposing predictions. The valence model predicted that anger, a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex. The direction model predicted that anger, an approach emotion, would activate the left prefrontal cortex. The second model was supported.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Harmon-Jones E, Vaughn-Scott K, Mohr S, Sigelman J, Harmon-Jones C |title=The effect of manipulated sympathy and anger on left and right frontal cortical activity |journal=Emotion |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=95–101 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15053729 |doi=10.1037/1528-3542.4.1.95 }}</ref>

This still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away (direction model), as unmoving but with strength and resistance (movement model), or as unmoving with passive yielding (action tendency model). Support for the action tendency model (passivity related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on shyness<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt LA |s2cid=145482474 |year=1999 |title=Frontal brain electrical activity in shyness and sociability |journal=Psychological Science |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=316–20 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00161}}</ref> and research on behavioral inhibition.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Táborský I, Dolník V |title=Physico-chemical properties of interferon produced by a mixed leukocyte suspension |journal=Acta Virologica |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=359–64 |date=September 1977 |pmid=22229 }}</ref> Research that tested the competing hypotheses generated by all four models also supported the action tendency model.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Drake RA, Myers LR |s2cid=144134109 |year=2006 |title=Visual attention, emotion, and action tendency: Feeling active or passive |journal=Cognition and Emotion |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=608–22 |doi=10.1080/02699930500368105}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wacker J, Chavanon ML, Leue A, Stemmler G |title=Is running away right?

{{anchor|Homeostatic emotion}}

==== Homeostatic/primordial emotion ====
Another neurological approach proposed by [[Arthur Craig|Bud Craig]] in 2003 distinguishes two classes of emotion: "classical" emotions such as love, anger and fear that are evoked by environmental stimuli, and "[[homeostatic emotion]]s"&nbsp;– attention-demanding feelings evoked by body states, such as pain, hunger and fatigue, that motivate behavior (withdrawal, eating or resting in these examples) aimed at maintaining the body's internal milieu at its ideal state.<ref name="Craig2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Craig AD |s2cid=16369323 |title=Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the body |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=500–55 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12965300 |doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(03)00090-4 |url=http://www.jsmf.org/meetings/2007/oct-nov/CONB%20Craig%202003.pdf }}</ref>

[[Derek Denton]] calls the latter "primordial emotions" and defines them as "the subjective element of the instincts, which are the genetically programmed behavior patterns which contrive [[homeostasis]]. They include thirst, hunger for air, hunger for food, pain and hunger for specific minerals etc. There are two constituents of a primordial emotion – the specific sensation which when severe may be imperious, and the compelling intention for gratification by a consummatory act."<ref name="Denton2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Denton DA, McKinley MJ, Farrell M, Egan GF |s2cid=14995914 |title=The role of primordial emotions in the evolutionary origin of consciousness |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=500–14 |date=June 2009 |pmid=18701321 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2008.06.009 }}</ref>

=== Emergent explanation ===
Emotions are seen by some researchers to be constructed (emerge) in social and cognitive domain alone, without directly implying [[Heredity|biologically inherited]] characteristics.

[[Joseph E. LeDoux|Joseph LeDoux]] differentiates between the human's defense system, which has evolved over time, and emotions such as fear and [[anxiety]]. He has said that the [[amygdala]] may release hormones due to a trigger (such as an innate reaction to seeing a snake), but "then we elaborate it through cognitive and conscious processes".<ref name="LeDoux" />

[[Lisa Feldman Barrett]] highlights differences in emotions between different cultures,<ref>See also [[emotions and culture]]</ref> and says that emotions (such as anxiety) are socially constructed (see [[theory of constructed emotion]]). She says that they "are not triggered; you create them. They emerge as a combination of the physical properties of your body, a flexible brain that wires itself to whatever environment it develops in, and your culture and upbringing, which provide that environment."<ref>How Emotions Are Made, 2017, Introduction</ref> She has termed this approach the [[theory of constructed emotion]].

== Disciplinary approaches ==
Many different disciplines have produced work on the emotions. [[Human science]]s study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In [[psychiatry]], emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. [[Nursing]] studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. [[Psychology]] examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes, e.g., [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]. In [[neuroscience]] sub-fields such as [[social neuroscience]] and [[affective neuroscience]], scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In [[linguistics]], the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In [[education]], the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.

[[Social science]]s often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions. In [[sociology]], emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In [[anthropology]], the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of [[communication studies]], critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]]'s concept of [[emotional labor]]. The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/emonet/ |title=EmoNet |publisher=Uq.edu.au |access-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218131800/http://www.uq.edu.au/emonet/ |archive-date=18 February 2013 }}</ref> an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings. The list was established in January 1997 and has over 700 members from across the globe.

In [[economics]], the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are analyzed in some sub-fields of microeconomics, in order to assess the role of emotions on purchase decision-making and risk perception. In [[criminology]], a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as [[anomie]] theory and studies of "toughness," aggressive behavior, and hooliganism. In [[law]], which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's emotions is often raised in [[tort]] law claims for compensation and in [[criminal law]] prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant's state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings). In [[political science]], emotions are examined in a number of sub-fields, such as the analysis of voter decision-making.

In [[philosophy]], emotions are studied in sub-fields such as [[ethics]], the [[aesthetics|philosophy of art]] (for example, sensory–emotional values, and matters of [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and [[sentimentality]]), and the [[philosophy of music]] (see also [[music and emotion]]). In [[history]], scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. In [[literature]] and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. In [[communication studies]], scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in [[ethology]], a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with strong ties to ecology and evolution. Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, [[aggression]]) in a number of unrelated animals.

=== History ===
{{main|History of emotions}}
The [[history of emotions]] has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars{{who|date=June 2017}} arguing that it is an [[essentialism|essential]] category of analysis, not unlike [[social stratification|class]], [[race (human categorization)#Social constructions|race]], or [[gender]]. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and the [[social constructivism|constructivist]] school of history claims even that some sentiments and [[meta-emotion]]s, for example [[schadenfreude]], are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyze the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural, or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of [[medicine]], [[science]], or [[psychology]]. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on [[social norm]]s and rules; thus historically variable and open to change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/history-of-emotions |title=History of Emotions &#124; Max Planck Institute for Human Development |publisher=Mpib-berlin.mpg.de |access-date=11 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505125400/https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/history-of-emotions |archive-date=5 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several research centers have opened in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unav.edu/web/instituto-cultura-y-sociedad/cultura-emocional-e-identidad |title=Cultura Emocional E Identidad |publisher=unav.edu |access-date=11 November 2013}}</ref> Sweden, and Australia.

Furthermore, research in [[historical trauma]] suggests that some [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] emotions can be passed on from parents to offspring to second and even third generation, presented as examples of [[transgenerational trauma]].

=== Sociology ===
{{main|Sociology of emotions}}
A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (for example, anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (for example, increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (for example, smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational [[sensory cue|cue]]s.<ref name="Thoits, P. A. 1989"/> One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009).<ref name="Turner2007">Turner, J.H. (2007). Human emotions: A sociological theory. London: Routledge.</ref><ref name="Turner2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner JH |s2cid=146259730 |year=2009 |title=The sociology of emotion: Basic Theoretical arguments |journal=Emotion Review |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=340–54 |doi=10.1177/1754073909338305}}</ref> Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.

Attempts are frequently made to regulate emotion according to the conventions of the society and the situation based on many (sometimes conflicting) demands and expectations which originate from various entities. The expression of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women to a greater extent than in boys and men (the notion being that an angry man has a valid complaint that needs to be rectified, while an angry women is hysterical or oversensitive, and her anger is somehow invalid), while the expression of sadness or fear is discouraged in boys and men relative to girls and women (attitudes implicit in phrases like "man up" or "don't be a sissy").<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/books/review/rebecca-traister-good-and-mad-soraya-chemaly-rage-becomes-her.html |title=The Power of Enraged Women |last=Blair |first=Elaine |date=2018-09-27 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-12-09 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/magazine/i-used-to-insist-i-didnt-get-angry-not-anymore.html |title=I Used to Insist I Didn't Get Angry.

Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. Some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as [[love]] in the case of contemporary institution of [[marriage]]. In advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Virendra |title=Ethics – Integrity & Aptitude |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTD2DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA75 |date=2016 |publisher=Neelkanth Pralashan |asin=B01BKSC2BK |page=75 |access-date=2019-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218043642/https://books.google.ca/books?id=qTD2DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA75 |archive-date=18 February 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Sociological attention to emotion has varied over time. [[Émile Durkheim]] (1915/1965)<ref>Durkheim, E. (1915/1912). The elementary forms of the religious life, trans. J.W. Swain. New York: Free Press.</ref> wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in Australian aborigine society. He explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power, a force, that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped. These feelings of exaltation, he argued, ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects.

In the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992),<ref>Cooley, C.H. (1992). Human nature and the social order. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers.</ref> pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the "looking glass" that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. Retzinger (1991)<ref>Retzinger, S.M. (1991). Violent emotions: Shame and rage in marital quarrels. London: SAGE.</ref> conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on Goffman and Cooley's work, Scheff (1990)<ref>Scheff, J. (1990). Microsociology: discourse, emotion and social structure. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref> developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.

Subsequent to these developments, Randall Collins (2004)<ref>Collins, R. (2004). Interaction ritual chains. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref> formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on Durkheim's work on totemic rituals that was extended by Goffman (1964/2013; 1967)<ref>Goffman, E. (1967). Interaction ritual. New York: Anchor Books.</ref><ref>Goffman, E. (1964/2013). Encounters: Two studies in the sociology of interactions. Mansfiled Centre, CT: Martino Publishing.</ref> into everyday focused encounters. Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity.

There is a growing body of research applying the sociology of emotion to understanding the learning experiences of students during classroom interactions with teachers and other students (for example, Milne & Otieno, 2007;<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Milne C, Otieno T |year=2007 |title=Understanding engagement: Science demonstrations and emotional energy |journal=Science Education |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=532–53 |doi=10.1002/sce.20203 |bibcode=2007SciEd..91..523M }}</ref> Olitsky, 2007;<ref>Olitsky, S.

These studies show that learning subjects like science can be understood in terms of classroom interaction rituals that generate emotional energy and collective states of emotional arousal like [[emotional climate]].

Apart from interaction ritual traditions of the sociology of emotion, other approaches have been classed into one of six other categories:<ref name="Turner2009"/>
* evolutionary/biological theories
* symbolic interactionist theories
* dramaturgical theories
* ritual theories
* power and status theories
* stratification theories
* exchange theories

This list provides a general overview of different traditions in the sociology of emotion that sometimes conceptualise emotion in different ways and at other times in complementary ways. Many of these different approaches were synthesized by Turner (2007) in his sociological theory of human emotions in an attempt to produce one comprehensive sociological account that draws on developments from many of the above traditions.<ref name="Turner2007"/>

=== Psychotherapy and regulation ===
Emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience.<ref>Schacter, Daniel. "Psychology". Worth Publishers. 2011. p.316</ref> For example, a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions (trying not to think about the situation, doing distracting activities, etc.).<ref>Schacter, Daniel. "Psychology". Worth Publishers. 2011. p.340</ref> Depending on the particular school's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion different schools of [[psychotherapy]] approach the regulation of emotion differently. Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as [[rational emotive behavior therapy]]. Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary [[Gestalt therapy]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.123webpages.co.uk/user/index.php?user=mgc&pn=10713 |title=On Emotion – an article from Manchester Gestalt Centre website |publisher=123webpages.co.uk |access-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512181355/http://www.123webpages.co.uk/user/index.php?user=mgc&pn=10713 |archive-date=12 May 2012 }}</ref>

=== Cross-cultural research ===
Research on emotions reveals the strong presence of cross-cultural differences in emotional reactions and that emotional reactions are likely to be culture-specific.<ref>Shaver, Phillip R.; Wu, Shelley; Schwartz, Judith C. Cross-''cultural similarities and differences in emotion and its representation'' In: Clark, Margaret S. (Ed), (1992). Emotion. Review of personality and social psychology, No. 13., (pp. 175–212). Thousand Oaks, CA, US: Sage Publications, Inc, ix, 326 pp</ref> In strategic settings, [[cross-cultural psychology|cross-cultural]] research on emotions is required for understanding the psychological situation of a given population or specific actors. This implies the need to comprehend the current emotional state, mental disposition or other behavioral motivation of a target audience located in a different culture, basically founded on its national, political, social, economic, and psychological peculiarities but also subject to the influence of circumstances and events.<ref>North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency AAP-6 – Glossary of terms and definitions, p. 188.</ref>

=== Computer science ===
{{main|Affective computing}}
In the 2000s, research in computer science, engineering, psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human [[affect (psychology)|affect]] display and model emotions.<ref>Fellous, Armony & LeDoux, 2002</ref> In computer science, [[affective computing]] is a branch of the study and development of [[artificial intelligence]] that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning [[computer science]]s, [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].<ref name="TaoTan">{{cite conference |first1=Jianhua |last1=Tao |first2=Tieniu |last2=Tan |name-list-style=vanc |title=Affective Computing: A Review |book-title=Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction; [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] |volume=3784 |pages=981–95 |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |doi=10.1007/11573548}}</ref> While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into [[#James–Lange theory|emotion]],<ref name=James/> the more modern branch of computer science originated with [[Rosalind Picard]]'s 1995 paper<ref>[http://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/95.picard.pdf "Affective Computing"] MIT Technical Report #321 ([http://vismod.media.mit.edu/pub/tech-reports/TR-321-ABSTRACT.html Abstract]), 1995</ref> on affective computing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ls12-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de//~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-interaction/Emotion-RecognitionAndSimulation.pdf |title=Recognition and Simulation of Emotions |access-date=13 May 2008 |last=Kleine-Cosack |first=Christian |name-list-style=vanc |date=October 2006 |quote=The introduction of emotion to computer science was done by Pickard (sic) who created the field of affective computing. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528135730/http://ls12-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-interaction/Emotion-RecognitionAndSimulation.pdf |archive-date=28 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/love.html |title=The Love Machine; Building computers that care. |magazine=Wired |access-date=13 May 2008 |last=Diamond |first=David |name-list-style=vanc |date=December 2003 |quote=Rosalind Picard, a genial [[MIT]] professor, is the field's godmother; her 1997 book, Affective Computing, triggered an explosion of interest in the emotional side of computers and their users.}}</ref> Detecting emotional information begins with passive [[sensor]]s which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors.

== The effects on memory ==
Emotion affects the way [[autobiographical memory|autobiographical memories]] are encoded and retrieved. Emotional memories are reactivated more, they are remembered better and have more attention devoted to them.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal|last1=D'Argembeau|first1=Arnaud|last2=Comblain|first2=Christine|last3=Van der Linden|first3=Martial|date=2003|title=Phenomenal characteristics of autobiographical memories for positive, negative, and neutral events|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=281–294|doi=10.1002/acp.856|issn=0888-4080}}</ref> Through remembering our past achievements and failures, autobiographical memories affect how we perceive and feel about ourselves.<ref name="auto"/>

[[File:William James b1842b.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.56|[[William James]]]]
In the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were [[William James]] (1842–1910) and [[Carl Lange (physician)|Carl Lange]] (1834–1900). James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the [[James–Lange theory]], a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cherry |first=Kendra |name-list-style=vanc |title=What Is the James-Lange Theory of Emotion? |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/jindex/g/jameslange.htm |access-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>

[[Silvan Tomkins]] (1911–1991) developed the [[affect theory]] and script theory. The affect theory introduced the concept of basic emotions, and was based on the idea that the dominance of the emotion, which he called the affected system, was the motivating force in human life.<ref>{{cite web |last=The Tomkins Institute |title=Applied Studies in Motivation, Emotion, and Cognition |url=http://www.tomkins.org/Tomkins.html |access-date=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319164455/http://www.tomkins.org/Tomkins.html |archive-date=19 March 2012 }}</ref>
