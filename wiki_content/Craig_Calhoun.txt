== Work ==
From 1999 to 2012 Calhoun was President of the [[Social Science Research Council]]. At the SSRC Calhoun emphasized the public contributions of social science. His views are explained in his essay "Towards a More Public Social Science", which first appeared in the SSRC's 2004 "President's Report" and has been translated, reprinted and widely circulated on the web.<ref>Calhoun, Craig Jackson (2004). "Towards a More Public Social Science". Social Science Research Council. ssrc.org. Retrieved 10&nbsp;September 2017.</ref> After September 11, 2001 he launched an initiative on "Real Time Social Science" which included an essay forum that attracted more than one million readers. This continued with work on the Privatization of Risk, Understanding Katrina: Perspectives from the Social Sciences Program, and now Haiti, Now and Next (examining the impact of the 2010 earthquake on Haiti's social and political future). His conversations with Paul Price have received wide circulation, podcast as Societas.

Calhoun has written more than 100 scholarly articles and chapters as well as books, among which his most famous is a study of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors: Students and the Struggle for Democracy in China'' (California, 1994). Calhoun's work has been translated into more than a dozen languages. Thesis Eleven (2006, Vol. 84, No. 1) devoted a special issue to his work, "Craig Calhoun: Critical Social Sciences and the Public Sphere." He was also editor in chief of the Oxford Dictionary of the Social Sciences. His recent work has focused on the future of capitalism and on humanitarianism. He has also written on Brexit and the rise of populism.

As the Director of the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] Calhoun was in the academic year 2012-13 the beneficiary of "one of the biggest increases in overall pay and benefits" in the British higher education sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/big-pay-rises-for-russell-group-chiefs-in-9k-fees-era/2010075.article|title = Big pay rises for Russell Group chiefs in £9K fees era|date = 2 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/03/new-breed-fat-cats-university-boss-vice-chancellors?CMP=twt_gu|title = Meet the new breed of fat cat: The university vice-chancellor &#124; Aditya Chakrabortty|date = 3 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/university-chiefs-under-fire-for-huge-pay-rises-after-tuition-fee-hikes-9034893.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Garner | title=The academic fat cats: Vice-chancellors at Britain's top universities get £22,000 pay rises – as lecturers are stuck on 1 per cent | date=2 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebeaveronline.com/calhoun-comfortably-compensated-2/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140305023937/http://www.thebeaveronline.com/calhoun-comfortably-compensated-2/ |archive-date=2014-03-05 }}</ref> As Director, Calhoun was very successful in raising funds for the LSE, including millions from the Marshall Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, and many other donors.
