During the late 20th century, the university underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university.

The majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] on [[Seth Low]]'s late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning principles by the architects [[McKim, Mead & White]]. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six [[city block]]s, or {{convert|32|acres|abbr=on}}, in [[Morningside Heights]], New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights.

The Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as [[Butler Library]], is the largest single library in the [[Columbia University Library System]], and is one of the largest buildings on the campus.

It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the [[Ionic order]] above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Butler Library: Self-Guided Tour|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/img/assets/5295/SelfGuided.pdf|access-date=April 11, 2011|publisher=Columbia University}}</ref> {{As of|2019}}, [[Columbia University Library System|Columbia's library system]] includes over 14.5 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.<ref name=":1" />

A statue by sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]] called ''[[Alma Mater (New York sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' is centered on the front steps of [[Low Memorial Library]]. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing [[List of Latin phrases (S)|sapientia and doctrina]]. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a [[royal charter]] institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.<ref>{{cite web|author=Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture|title=Alma Mater (sculpture)|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!20526~!0#focus|access-date=April 14, 2011|publisher=The Smithsonian Institution}}</ref> The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a [[women's college]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Meredith Foster|date=February 11, 2011|title=The Myth of the College Sweetheart|url=http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307091227/http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart|archive-date=March 7, 2011|access-date=April 14, 2011|work=The Eye|publisher=Columbia Spectator}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=May 19, 1999|title=What Is the Mace?

===Sustainability===
In 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and "green" building design principles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manhattanville in West Harlem|url=http://manhattanville.columbia.edu/design-goals|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212021255/http://manhattanville.columbia.edu/design-goals|archive-date=December 12, 2014|access-date=April 11, 2011|publisher=Columbia University}}</ref> Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their [[Greenhouse gas emissions|greenhouse emissions]] by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The university requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Projects: Green Buildings|url=http://environment.columbia.edu/green-buildings|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508230555/http://www.environment.columbia.edu/green-buildings|archive-date=May 8, 2014|access-date=April 11, 2011|publisher=Columbia Environmental Stewardship}}</ref>

Every Thursday and Sunday of the month, Columbia hosts a [[Farmers' market|greenmarket]] where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city.

=== Undergraduate admissions and financial aid ===
[[File:Vanamquad.JPEG|left|thumb|[[John Howard Van Amringe (sculpture)|Van Amringe Quadrangle and Memorial]]]]
Columbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Columbia acceptance rate drops to record low 3.7 percent after 51 percent spike in applications|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/04/07/columbia-acceptance-rate-drops-to-record-low-37-percent-after-51-percent-spike-in-applications/|access-date=2021-05-15|website=Columbia Daily Spectator}}</ref> Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.<ref name="stat2">{{cite web|title=Financial Aid Statistics|url=http://cc-seas.financialaid.columbia.edu/eligibility/facts|publisher=Columbia University}}</ref> In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).<ref>{{cite web|title=Columbia University Tuition And Costs|url=http://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg03_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=399|access-date=November 22, 2016|website=Collegedata.com}}</ref>

Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus [[John Kluge]] to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|date=2007-04-11|title=Columbia to Receive $400 Million for Student Aid|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/11/nyregion/11columbia.html|access-date=2021-05-15|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> {{As of|2008}}, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.<ref>{{Cite news|date=March 11, 2008|title=Columbia University to Offer Financial Aid to More Students|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/education/11columbia.html|access-date=March 28, 2010}}</ref> In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] and the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]] (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the [[Common Application]]. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last [[Ivy League]] university to switch to the Common Application.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|date=March 23, 2010|title=Columbia, Michigan and Connecticut Among 25 Colleges to Add Common Application|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/common-2/|access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref>

Scholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars "distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Named Scholars|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/scholars/named|access-date=August 3, 2015|website=Studentaffairs.columbia.edu}}</ref>

In 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the first modern college application". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gross, Jessica|date=November 10, 2013|title=Who Made That College Application?|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/who-made-that-college-application.html|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>

Columbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is "[[Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York|The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York]]". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]''. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The trustees appoint the president and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.<ref name="Columbia.edu2">{{cite web|title=Board of Trustees|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|access-date=April 17, 2011|publisher=Columbia University}}</ref>
[[File:Lowbanners.jpg|left|thumb|Low Memorial Library]]
The University Senate was established by the trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the provost, the deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all of whom serve ''ex officio'', and five additional representatives, appointed by the president, from the university's administration. The president serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.<ref>{{cite web|title=Columbia University Senate|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/|access-date=April 17, 2011|publisher=Columbia University}}</ref><ref name="senate.columbia.edu2">{{cite web|date=2017|title=Election packet|url=http://senate.columbia.edu|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceB2">{{cite web|title=Elections|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/topbar_pages/elections.html|website=Senate.columbia.edu}}</ref>

====Broadcasting====
Columbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate [[campus radio]] broadcasting, [[WKCR-FM]] and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, [[WBAR (Barnard College)|WBAR]]. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-state area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]]. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR was not a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.<ref>{{cite web|year=2009|title="The Original FM": The Columbia University Radio Club|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/history|access-date=January 12, 2013|publisher=Columbia University}}</ref> The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at [[4 Times Square]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest [[student television station]] and the home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web|title=CTV News|url=http://www.ctvnewsonline.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104113018/http://www.ctvnewsonline.com/|archive-date=November 4, 2006|access-date=August 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CTV|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ctv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820181902/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ctv/|archive-date=August 20, 2006|access-date=August 10, 2006}}</ref>

Columbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against [[Rutgers University]] in the second intercollegiate rugby football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters.

In one of the school's longest-lasting traditions, begun in 1975, at midnight before the [[Organic chemistry|Organic Chemistry]] exam—often the first day of final exams—the [[Columbia University Marching Band]] invaded and briefly occupied the main undergraduate reading room in [[Butler Library]] to distract and entertain studying students with some forty-five minutes of raucous jokes and music, beginning and ending with the singing of the school's fight song, "[[Roar, Lion, Roar]]".<ref>{{cite news|date=December 20, 1975|title=Columbia Cram Session Can Be Fun, Too|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/20/archives/columbia-cram-session-can-be-fun-too.html|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> After the main show before a crowd that routinely began filling the room well before the announced midnight start time, the Band led a procession to several campus locations, including the residential quadrangle of [[Barnard College]] for more music and temporary relief from the stress of last-minute studying.

The campus Tree Lighting ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent Hall and [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]] on the east end and Dodge Hall and Pulitzer Hall on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by ''a cappella'' groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Hollander|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|access-date=April 15, 2011|publisher=Columbia University News}}</ref>

Immediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]], but lapsed before being revived by President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] in 1910. A troop of students dressed as [[Continental Army]] soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of [[John Jay Hall]], where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' by [[Clement Clarke Moore]] and ''[[Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus]]'' by [[Francis Pharcellus Church]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hollander|first=Jason|date=December 3, 1999|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|access-date=August 10, 2006|work=Columbia News}}</ref>
