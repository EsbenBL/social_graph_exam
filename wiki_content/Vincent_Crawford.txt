Crawford's research focuses on behavioural game theory, specifically bargaining and communication, experimental economics and matching. His work on strategic information transmission has been seminal in the field of strategic communication in economic games, with his 1982 paper (co-authored with [[Joel Sobel]]) establishing the concept of [[cheap talk]] in game theory.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853313603|title=Eminent economists II : their life and work philosophies|others=Szenberg, Michael,, Ramrattan, Lall, 1951-|date=February 24, 2014|isbn=978-1-107-04053-3|location=New York|oclc=853313603}}</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' predicted him to be the next [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize laureate]] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2011-10-04|title=Runners and riders|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2011/10/04/runners-and-riders|access-date=2021-01-07|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>
