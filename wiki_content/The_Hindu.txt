==History==
''The Hindu'' was founded in [[Madras]] on 20 September 1878 as a weekly newspaper, by what was known then as the '''Triplicane Six''' consisting of four law students and two teachers:- T. T. Rangacharya, P. V. Rangacharya, D. Kesava Rao Pantulu and [[N. Subba Rao Pantulu]], led by [[G. Subramania Iyer]] (a school teacher from [[Tanjore District (Madras Presidency)|Tanjore district]]) and M. Veeraraghavacharyar, a [[lecturer]] at Pachaiyappa's College.<ref>{{cite news|first1=M.S.|last1=Ramnath|first2=Mitu|last2=Jayshankar|title=The Hindu board room becomes a battlefield|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/boardroom/the-hindu-board-room-becomes-battlefield/12462/0|access-date=4 March 2014|newspaper=Forbes India|date=22 April 2010}}</ref> Started in order to support the campaign of [[Sir T. Muthuswamy Iyer]] for a judgeship at the [[Madras High Court]] and to counter the campaign against him carried out by the [[Anglo-Indian]] press, ''The Hindu'' was one of the newspapers of the period established to protest the policies of the [[British Raj]]. About 100 copies of the inaugural issue were printed at Srinidhi Press, [[Georgetown, Chennai|Georgetown]], on one rupee and twelve annas of borrowed money. Subramania Iyer became the first editor and Veera Raghavacharya, the first [[managing director]] of the newspaper.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The paper was initially printed from Srinidhi Press but later moved to Scottish Press, then to The Hindu Press, [[Mylapore]]. Started as a weekly newspaper, the paper became a tri-weekly in 1883 and an evening daily in 1889. A single copy of the newspaper was priced at four [[Indian anna|anna]]s. The offices moved to rented premises at 100 [[Mount Road]] on 3 December 1883. The newspaper started printing at its own press there, named "The National Press," which was established on borrowed capital as public subscriptions were not forthcoming. The building itself became ''The Hindu''{{'}}s in 1892, after the Maharaja of [[Vizianagaram]], [[Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju]], gave The National Press a loan both for the building and to carry out needed expansion.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

'Its editorial stances have earned it the nickname, the '[[Maha Vishnu]] of Mount Road'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://keetru.com/vizhippunarvu/oct08/kuthusigurusami.php|title=Vizhippunarvu - Kuthusigurusami - Kuruvikarambaivelu - Periyar - Kudiarasu|access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> "From the new address, 100 Mount Road, which was to remain ''The Hindu''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> home till 1939, there issued a [[quarto]]-size paper with a front-page full of advertisements—a practice that came to an end only in 1958 when it followed the lead of its idol, the pre-[[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Thomson]] ''[[The Times|Times]]'' [London]—and three back pages also at the service of the advertiser. In between, there were more views than news."<ref name="WillingToStrike">{{cite web | author=S.

The partnership between Veeraraghavachariar and Subramania Iyer was dissolved in October 1898. Iyer quit the paper and Veeraraghavachariar became the sole owner and appointed [[C. Karunakara Menon]] the editor. However, ''The Hindu''{{'}}s adventurousness began to decline in the 1900s and so did its circulation, which was down to 800 copies when the sole proprietor decided to sell out. The purchaser was ''The Hindu''{{'}}s Legal Adviser from 1895, [[S. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&page=flonnet&rdurl=fl2020/stories/20031010005512800.htm|title=Navigation News - Frontline|access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> a politically ambitious lawyer who had migrated from a [[Kumbakonam]] village to practise in [[Coimbatore]] and from thence to [[Madras]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Iyengar's son, Kasturi Srinivasan, became managing editor of The Hindu upon his father's death in 1923 and Chief Editor in February 1934. The  Kasturi family, descendants of Kasturi Ranga Iyengar,  have since  owned and, through most of the paper's life, held the top editorial positions in the company.

In 1987–88, ''The Hindu'''s coverage of the [[Bofors arms deal scandal]], a series of document-backed exclusives, set the terms of the national political discourse on this subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/1989-scandal-in-india/index.html|title=1989: Scandal in India|website=centennial.journalism.columbia.edu|language=en-US|access-date=24 January 2018}}</ref> The Bofors scandal broke in April 1987 with [[Sveriges Radio|Swedish Radio]] alleging that bribes had been paid to top Indian political leaders, officials and Army officers in return for the Swedish arms manufacturing company winning a hefty contract with the Government of India for the purchase of 155&nbsp;mm howitzers. During a six-month period, the newspaper published scores of copies of original papers that documented the secret payments, amounting to $50 million, into Swiss bank accounts, the agreements behind the payments, communications relating to the payments and the crisis response, and other material. The investigation was led by a part-time correspondent of ''The Hindu'', [[Chitra Subramaniam]], reporting from [[Geneva]], and was supported by Ram in Chennai. The scandal was a major embarrassment to the party in power at the centre, the [[Indian National Congress]], and its leader Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. The paper's editorial accused the Prime Minister of being party to massive fraud and cover-up.<ref name="DevelopPaperNewReader">{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/th125/stories/2003091300830500.htm |title=Developing a paper for a new reader |work=The Hindu |date=13 September 2003 |access-date=20 April 2006 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041124154440/http://www.hinduonnet.com/th125/stories/2003091300830500.htm |archive-date=24 November 2004}}</ref><!--what became of the legal proceedings, how it fizzled out.. that deserves mention, right?-->

In 1991, Deputy Editor N. Ravi, Ram's younger brother, replaced G. Kasturi as editor. Nirmala Lakshman, Kasturi Srinivasan's granddaughter and the first woman in the company to hold an editorial or managerial role, became Joint Editor of ''The Hindu'' and her sister, Malini Parthasarathy, Executive Editor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/blog/story/ithe-hindui-very-divided-family/2225|title=The Hindu: Very Divided Family|work=www.outlookindia.com|access-date=24 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2003, the [[Jayalalitha]] government of the state of Tamil Nadu, of which Chennai is the capital, filed cases against ''The Hindu'' for breach of privilege of the state legislative body. The move was perceived as a government's assault on freedom of the press. The paper garnered support from the journalistic community.<ref>{{cite web |author=Onkar Singh |url= http://inhome.rediff.com/news/2003/nov/08hindu.htm |title=Journalists protest TN assembly's arrest of scribes |date=8 November 2003 |access-date=20 April 2006}}</ref>

In 2010, ''[[The Indian Express]]'' reported a dispute within the publisher of ''The Hindu'' regarding the retirement age of the person working as the editor-in-chief, a post which was then being served by N. Ram. Following this report, Ram decided to sue ''The Indian Express'' for defamation, a charge which the ''Indian Express'' denied. [[N. Ravi]] and [[Malini Parthasarathy]] voiced concern about Ram's decision, saying that doing so goes against ''The Hindu''’s values and that journalists shouldn’t fear “scrutiny”, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bansal|first=Vidhya Sivaramakrishnan and Shuchi|date=2010-03-25|title=Ram to initiate legal action against Express for story on internal tussle|url=https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/JLCZIVNqLgskfDNFDGB4LI/Ram-to-initiate-legal-action-against-Express-for-story-on-in.html|access-date=2020-10-04|website=mint|language=en}}</ref> During subsequent events, Parthasarathy tweeted that “issues relating to management of newspaper have come to the surface, including editorial direction” in her response to a question.

In 2011, during the resignation of [[N. Ram]], the newspaper became the subject of a succession battle between the members of the Kasturi family. Ram had appointed [[Siddharth Varadarajan]] as his successor as the editor-in-chief of the newspaper who justified the appointment on the ostensible basis of separation of ownership and management, which was opposed by [[N.

During the dispute, [[Narasimhan Murali]] alleged that [[N. Ram]] ran ''The Hindu'' “like a banana republic, with cronyism and vested interests ruling the roost”. In the end the board voted 6–6 over a review of the appointment, the tie was broken by a deciding vote from Ram in his capacity as the chairman of the company and in favor of his decision.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2013-11-07|title=The family feud which is gripping India's media: Editor of 'The Hindu' newspaper resigns|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/family-feud-which-gripping-india-s-media-editor-hindu-newspaper-resigns-8925384.html|access-date=2020-10-04|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:The Hindu Chennai.jpg|thumb|200px|Headquarters of ''The Hindu'' in [[Anna Salai]], [[Chennai]]]]In 1965, ''[[The Times]]'' listed ''The Hindu'' as one of the world's ten best newspapers. Discussing each of its choices in separate articles, ''The Times'' wrote: "''The Hindu'' takes the general seriousness to lengths of severity... published in Madras, it is the only newspaper which in spite of being published only in a provincial capital is regularly and attentively read in Delhi. It is read not only as a distant and authoritative voice on national affairs but as an expression of the most liberal—and least provincial—southern attitudes... Its Delhi Bureau gives it outstanding political and economic dispatches and it carries regular and frequent reports from all state capitals, so giving more news from states, other than its own, than most newspapers in India... It might fairly be described as a national voice with a southern accent. ''The Hindu'' can claim to be the most respected paper in India."<ref name="DevelopPaperNewReader" /><ref>{{cite news |work=The Times |date=3 March 1965 |title=Newspapers of the World: VI - The Hindu |page=11 |issue=56260}}</ref>

In 1968, the American Newspaper Publishers' Association awarded ''The Hindu'' its World Press Achievement Award. An extract from the citation reads:
"Throughout nearly a century of its publication The Hindu has exerted wide influence not only in Madras but throughout India. Conservative in both tone and appearance, it has wide appeal to the English-speaking segment of the population and wide readership among government officials and business leaders... ''The Hindu'' has provided its readers a broad and balanced news coverage, enterprising reporting and a sober and thoughtful comment... It has provided its country a model of journalistic excellence... It has fought for a greater measure of humanity for India and its people... and has not confined itself to a narrow chauvinism. Its Correspondents stationed in the major capitals of the world furnish ''The Hindu'' with world-wide news coverage... For its championing of reason over emotion, for its dedication to principle even in the face of criticism and popular disapproval, for its confidence in the future, it has earned the respect of its community, its country, and the world."<ref name="DevelopPaperNewReader" />
