He is a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2009. He also served as the chair of the [[Boskin Commission]] which changed the way inflation was measured.

According to [[Patrick Buchanan]], in [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/death-of-manufacturing/ Death of Manufacturing], Boskin was sanguine about the transfer of United States [[manufacturing]] overseas.

Notoriously, during the time he was an economic advisor to the G.W. Bush administration, he is noted to have said, "Potato chips, semiconductor chips, what is the difference? They are all chips. A hundred dollars' worth of one or a hundred dollars' worth of the other is still a hundred dollars."<ref>https://www.forbes.com/asap/2001/0910/032.html</ref>
