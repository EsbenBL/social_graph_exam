==Professional career – refugee support and advocacy==
Stevenson has worked as a psychologist at the [[Manus Regional Processing Centre]] and the [[Nauru Detention Centre]], providing support to both staff and detainees.<ref name="doherty-and-marr-2016">{{cite news|last1=Doherty|first1=Ben|last2=Marr|first2=David|title=The worst I've seen – trauma expert lifts lid on 'atrocity' of Australia's detention regime|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/the-worst-ive-seen-trauma-expert-lifts-lid-on-atrocity-of-australias-detention-regime|access-date=2016-06-21|work=The Guardian|date=19 June 2016}}</ref>  He maintains that the levels of [[psychological trauma]] at these Centres are the worst he has ever seen, and that Australia has an ethical responsibility to ensure these Centres are closed down.<ref name="doherty-and-marr-2016"/>  As a result of speaking out, Stevenson had his contract to work on Nauru summarily terminated by PsyCare.<ref name="doherty-2016">{{cite news|last1=Doherty|first1=Ben|title=Offshore detention whistleblower loses job after condemning 'atrocity' of camps|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/21/offshore-detention-whistleblower-loses-job-after-condemning-atrocity-of-camps|access-date=2016-06-21|work=The Guardian|date=21 June 2016}}</ref>

==Professional views==
Stevenson suggests that the traditional method of [[Critical Incident Stress Debriefing]] needs to be used with caution, and suggests that an eclectic and humanitarian approach is necessary for stress and trauma response.<ref>Stevenson, Paul. ''Postcards from Ground Zero''. Burleigh: Zeus Publications.</ref> Stevenson believes that to some extent [[psychological trauma]] may be a natural reaction to extreme circumstances, and we need to de-stigmatize this, as indeed we need to de-stigmatize [[mental illness]].<ref>Ibid.</ref>

==Politics==
Stevenson was an Independent Candidate for the Senate (Queensland) in the [[2016 Australian federal election]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mysunshinecoast.com.au/business/display/paul-j-stevenson-oam-australian-democrats-federal-senate-candidate,38277,2837 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502091325/http://www.mysunshinecoast.com.au/business/display/paul-j-stevenson-oam-australian-democrats-federal-senate-candidate,38277,2837 |archive-date=2 May 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>http://www.warwickdailynews.com.au/…/australian-demo…/37896/
