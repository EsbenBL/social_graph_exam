Virginia's largest public educational institution with 35,189 students in 2017 is [[George Mason University]], which is located in unincorporated Fairfax County, along the city's southern border while still having a City of Fairfax address and sharing the same public transportation system.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://relations.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Key-Facts-Pocket-Card-2017-State-Government-Relations.pdf |title=George Mason University Key Facts For 2017 |publisher=Office of Government & Community Relations, George Mason University |date=December 20, 2016 |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Fairfax court house during the Civil War.jpg|thumb|left|Fairfax Court House, Virginia, with [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers in front and on the roof, June 1863]]

The city derives its name from [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], who was awarded {{convert|5000000|acre|km2}} of land in northern Virginia by King Charles.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ |title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States |publisher=Govt.

The scene of the first land battle of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1861)|Battle of Fairfax Court House]] took place here on June 1, 1861, after a [[Union Army|Union]] scouting party clashed with the local militia with neither side gaining advantage. A [[Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863)|second battle]] took place here two years later on June 27, 1863, where Union troops were defeated. This battle delayed the movements of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] cavalry chief [[J. E. B. Stuart|Jeb Stuart]] with disastrous consequences for [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] a few days later.<ref>Battle of Fairfax Court House June 1861 and June 1863: {{Hanging indent | {{cite book |last=Poland Jr.|first=Charles P. |title=The Glories Of War: Small Battle And Early Heroes Of 1861 |publisher=AuthorHouse |date=2006|isbn=978-1-4184-5973-4}}{{rp|27}}}} {{Hanging indent | {{cite book |title=Stuart's Tarheels: James B.

The former Fairfax County Courthouse is the oldest historic building in Fairfax. The first Fairfax courthouse was established in 1742 near present-day [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]], and is the namesake for Old Courthouse Road.<ref>[https://fcrevite.com/library/branches/vr/courthouse/default.htm ] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It intersects with Gallows Road, which today is a major commuter route, but at the time was the road where condemned prisoners were led to the [[gallows]] at the old courthouse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://braddockheritage.org/resources/item/100/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005053804/http://braddockheritage.org/resources/item/100/|url-status=dead|title=A Look Back at Braddock District History|archive-date=October 5, 2011}}</ref> In 1752, the courthouse was moved to [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], which offered to build the new courthouse at their own expense. The reason the courthouse was moved from the Tysons Corner location was because of "Indian hostilities", as noted on the stone marker at the northwest corner of Gallows Road and [[Virginia State Route 123|Route 123]].  The courthouse operated there until 1790, when Virginia ceded the land where the courthouse was located for the creation of Washington, DC. The General Assembly specified that the new courthouse should be located in the center of the county, and was established at the corner of what was Old [[Little River Turnpike]] and is now Main Street and what was Ox Road and is now [[Chain Bridge Road]] on land donated by town founder Richard Ratcliffe.<ref>[http://www.historicfairfax.org/HFCI31.pdf HFCI31.pmd] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128034727/http://www.historicfairfax.org/HFCI31.pdf |date=November 28, 2007 }}.

According to the magazine, "These factors are increasingly important in a recession. When businesses and jobs retract, as they have nationwide, municipalities with strong environments for start-ups, and those that offer attractive amenities, are better suited to recover from economic downtimes, as there are more business activity filling the void."
