The region of modern-day São Paulo, then known as Piratininga plains around the [[Tietê River]], was inhabited by the [[Tupi people]], such as the [[Tupiniquim]], Guaianas, and [[Guaraní people|Guarani]]. Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goodman, Edward Julius |title=The Explorers of South America |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=1992 |location=Oklahoma}}</ref>

The region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Steward, Julian Haynes |title=Handbook of South American Indians |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |year=1946 |isbn=9780806124209 |location=Washington D.C}}</ref> The most notable Cacique was Tibiriça, known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists.

===Colonial period===
[[File:Antônio Parreiras - Fundação de São Paulo, 1913.jpg|thumb|''Founding of São Paulo'', 1913 painting by Antonio Parreiras]]
[[File:Pátio do Colégio in São Paulo.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the College, ''Pátio do Colégio'', in the Historic Center of São Paulo. At this location, the city was founded in 1554. The current building is a reconstruction made in the late 20th century, based on the [[Jesuit]] [[college]] and [[church (building)|church]] that were erected at the site in 1653.]]

The Portuguese village of [[São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga]] was marked by the founding of the [[Pátio do Colégio|Colégio de São Paulo de Piratininga]] on January 25, 1554. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college of twelve priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and Spanish priest [[José de Anchieta]]. They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the [[Anhangabaú River|Anhangabaú]] and [[Tamanduateí River|Tamanduateí]] rivers.<ref name="Lawrence183">[[#Lawrence69|Rachel Lawrence]]: 2010, p. 183</ref>

They first had a small structure built of [[rammed earth]], made by American Indian workers in their traditional style. The priests wanted to [[catechesis|evangelize]] the Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. The site was separated from the coast by the [[Serra do Mar]] mountain range, called by the Indians "Serra Paranapiacaba".

The college was named for a Christian saint and its founding on the feast day of the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus]]. Father José de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the Society of Jesus:

{{quote|The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College began in 1560. During the visit of Mem de Sá, Governor-General of Brazil, the Captaincy of São Vicente, he ordered the transfer of the population of the Village of Santo André da Borda do Campo to the vicinity of the college. It was then named "College of St. Paul Piratininga". The new location was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the lowland do Carmo. It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups. It was renamed Vila de São Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of São Vicente.}}

For the next two centuries, São Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence crops]] by the labor of natives. For a long time, São Paulo was the only village in Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area. Mem de Sá forbade colonists to use the "Path Piraiquê" (Piaçaguera today), because of frequent Indian raids along it.

On March 22, 1681, the Marquis de Cascais, the donee of the Captaincy of [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]], moved the capital to the village of St. Paul, designating it the "Head of the captaincy". The new capital was established on April 23, 1683, with public celebrations.

====The Bandeirantes====
{{Main|Bandeirantes}}
[[File:Sao Paulo - Monumento às Bandeiras - foto Carlos Alkmin nr 07-13 4282b.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Monument to the Bandeiras]] commemorates the 17th-century ''[[bandeiras]]'']]

In the 17th century, São Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese colony. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]], as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the region of [[Minas Gerais]], in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to São Paulo. The Captaincy of São Paulo and do Ouro was created on November 3, 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of São Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.<ref>[https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/captaincy-system Captaincy System]</ref>

Conveniently located in the country, up the steep ''[[Serra do Mar]]'' sea ridge when traveling from [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], while also not too far from the coastline, São Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travelers. The town became a center for the ''[[bandeirantes]]'', intrepid invaders who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave.
[[File:Jesus, Benedito Calixto de - Domingos Jorge Velho e o Loco-tenente Antônio F. de Abreu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Domingos Jorge Velho]], a notable ''bandeirante''.]]

The ''bandeirantes'', which could be translated as "flag-bearers" or "flag-followers", organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. The ''bandeirantes'' eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the [[Jesuit]]s from the city of São Paulo in 1640. The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits' opposition to the domestic [[slave trade]] in Indians.

On July 11, 1711, the town of São Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiabá and Goiania. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the [[Tordesillas Line]] to incorporate the gold regions.

When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted to growing [[sugar cane]]. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the [[Port of Santos]]. At that time, the first modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Walk of Lorraine.

Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of São Paulo, in the city of São Paulo, is called the ''Palácio dos Bandeirantes'' (Palace of Bandeirantes), in the neighborhood of Morumbi.

After Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, as declared by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] where the Monument of Ipiranga is located, he named São Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of São Francisco, today part of the [[University of São Paulo]]. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city's growth, thanks to which the city became the ''Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga''.

The expansion of [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee production]] was a major factor in the growth of São Paulo, as it became the region's chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially in the Vale do Paraíba (''Paraíba Valley'') region in the East of the State of São Paulo, and later on in the regions of [[Campinas]], [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], São Carlos and [[Ribeirão Preto]].

From 1869 onward, São Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the Railroad Santos-Jundiaí, nicknamed'' The Lady''. In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital. São Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of São Paulo.

In 1888, the "Golden Law" (''Lei Áurea'') was sanctioned by [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]], 
abolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil. Slaves were the main source of labor in the coffee plantations until then. As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital. The region's first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.

===Old Republican Period===
[[File:Guilherme Gaensly - Estação da Luz, c. 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Luz Station]] in 1900]]
[[File:Avenida Paulista 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Paulista Avenue]] in 1902]]

By the time Brazil became a republic on November 15, 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of São Paulo's economy. São Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as "[[Café com leite politics|coffee and milk]]", given that [[Minas Gerais]] was famous for its dairy produce.

During this period, São Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second [[Estação da Luz]] (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the [[Paulista Avenue]] in 1900, where they built many mansions.<ref name="Prefeitura">{{Cite web |date=October 5, 2005 |title=Abrindo os trilhos para a locomotiva |url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=4827 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323070214/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=4827 |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |access-date=March 9, 2017 |publisher=Prefeitura de São Paulo}}</ref>

Industrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and São Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The cultural scene followed [[modernism|modernist]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets [[Mário de Andrade]] and [[Oswald de Andrade]], artists [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Tarsila do Amaral]] and [[Lasar Segall]], and sculptor [[Victor Brecheret]]. The [[Modern Art Week]] of 1922 that took place at the [[Theatro Municipal (São Paulo)|Theatro Municipal]] was an event marked by [[avant-garde]] ideas and works of art. In 1929, São Paulo won its first skyscraper, the [[Martinelli Building]].<ref name="Prefeitura" />

The modifications made in the city by Antônio da Silva Prado, Baron of Duprat and [[Washington Luiz]], who governed from 1899 to 1919, contributed to the climate Development of the city; Some scholars consider that the entire city was demolished and rebuilt at that time.

São Paulo's main economic activities derive from the services industry – factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as [[Barra Funda]] and [[Brás]]. Some cities around São Paulo, such as [[Diadema, São Paulo|Diadema]], [[São Bernardo do Campo]], [[Santo André]], and [[Cubatão]] are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.

===Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932===
{{main|Constitutionalist Revolution}}
[[File:Werner Haberkorn - Vista aérea do centro da cidade. São Paulo-SP 8.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown São Paulo in 1950s by [[Werner Haberkorn]].]]
[[File:São Paulo aviation group in Campo de Marte September 1932.jpg|thumb|left|Group of aviators from São Paulo at [[Campo de Marte Airport]] in September 1932]]

This revolution is considered by some historians as the last armed conflict to take place in Brazil's history. On July 9, 1932, the population of São Paulo town rose against a [[coup d'état]] by [[Getúlio Vargas]] to take the presidential office. The movement grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree, unbound by a constitution, in a provisional government. The 1930 coup also affected São Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor of São Paulo Júlio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic, while simultaneously overthrowing President [[Washington Luís]], who was governor of São Paulo from 1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the Old Republic.

The uprising commenced on July 9, 1932, after four protesting students were killed by federal government troops on May 23, 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called MMDC (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later.
[[File:Passagem_da_Tocha_Olímpica_em_SP_(28605512140).jpg|thumb|right|[[Obelisk of São Paulo]], at [[Ibirapuera Park]]]]

In a few months, the state of São Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of the political elites of two other powerful states, ([[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]), the politicians from São Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the São Paulo revolt was militarily crushed on October 2, 1932.

In total, there were 87 days of fighting (July 9 to October 4, 1932 – with the last two days after the surrender of São Paulo), with a balance of 934 official deaths, though non-official estimates report up to 2,200 dead, and many cities in the state of São Paulo suffered damage due to fighting.

There is an obelisk in front of [[Ibirapuera Park]] that serves as a memorial to the young men that died for the MMDC. The [[University of São Paulo]]'s Law School also pays homage to the students that died during this period with plaques hung on its arcades.

São Paulo is in [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazil]], in southeastern [[São Paulo State]], approximately halfway between [[Curitiba]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The city is on a [[plateau]] placed beyond the [[Serra do Mar]] (Portuguese for "Sea Range" or "Coastal Range"), itself a component of the vast region known as the [[Brazilian Highlands]], with an average elevation of around {{convert|799|m|ft|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], although being at a distance of only about {{convert|70|km|mi|sp=us}} from [[Atlantic Ocean|the Atlantic Ocean]]. The distance is covered by two highways, the [[Rodovia Anchieta|Anchieta]] and the [[Rodovia dos Imigrantes|Imigrantes]], (see "[[#Transportation|Transportation]]" below) that roll down the range, leading to the port city of [[Santos, Brazil|Santos]] and the beach resort of [[Guarujá]]. Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo except in its northern area, where the [[Serra da Cantareira]] Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic Rain Forest]]. The region is seismically stable and no significant [[earthquake|seismic activity]] has ever been recorded.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About SP &#125; |url=http://www.famousdestination.com/2011/09/about-sao-paulo-city-brazil.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318074026/http://www.famousdestination.com/2011/09/about-sao-paulo-city-brazil.html |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |access-date=July 22, 2014 |publisher=Famousdestination.com }}</ref>

===Metropolitan area===

The nonspecific term "Grande São Paulo" ("''Greater São Paulo''") covers multiple definitions. The legally defined ''Região Metropolitana de São Paulo'' consists of 39 municipalities in total and a population of 21.1 million<ref name="bra">Constituent municipalities as listed by {{Cite web |title=Informações Básicas das Regiões Metropolitanas Brasileiras |url=http://www.observatoriodasmetropoles.ufrj.br/metrodata/ibrm/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007113832/http://www.observatoriodasmetropoles.ufrj.br/metrodata/ibrm/index.html |archive-date=October 7, 2011 |website=Obervatorio das Metropoles}} Population figures from the sum of the municipalities' population: [http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/estimativa2014/POP2014_DOU.pdf IBGE]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> inhabitants ({{As of|2014||alt=as of the 2014 National Census}}).

The Metropolitan Region of São Paulo is known as the financial, economic, and cultural center of Brazil. Among the largest municipalities, [[Guarulhos]], with a population of more than 1 million people is the biggest one. Several others count more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as [[São Bernardo do Campo]] (811,000 inh.) and [[Santo André]] (707,000 inh.) in the [[ABC Region]]. The ABC Region, comprising Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo and [[São Caetano do Sul]] in the south of Grande São Paulo, is an important location for industrial corporations, such as [[Volkswagen]] and [[Ford Motors]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=MRSP |url=http://www.metodista.br/letras/portuguese/metropolitan-region/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909031733/http://www.metodista.br/letras/portuguese/metropolitan-region/ |archive-date=September 9, 2012 }}</ref>

Because São Paulo has [[urban sprawl]], it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo and the [[São Paulo Macrometropolis]].

The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the most cold season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses. [[Frost]]s occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Regions further away from the center and in cities in the metropolitan area, can reach temperatures next to {{convert|0|°C}}, or even lower in the winter.

Rainfall is abundant, annually averaging {{convert|1454|mm|in|sp=us}}.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tempo Agora – Somar Meteorologia |title=Climate of São Paulo |url=http://tempoagora.uol.com.br/previsaodotempo.html/brasil/climatologia/SaoPaulo-SP/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227182621/http://tempoagora.uol.com.br/previsaodotempo.html/brasil/climatologia/SaoPaulo-SP/ |archive-date=February 27, 2010 |access-date=April 17, 2010 |publisher=Tempoagora.uol.com.br}}</ref> It is especially common in the warmer months averaging {{convert|219|mm|in|sp=us}} and decreases in winter, averaging {{convert|47|mm|in|sp=us}}. Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a [[tropical cyclone]] and [[tornado|tornadic]] activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as ''"veranico"'' or ''"verãozinho"'' ("little summer"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above {{convert|28|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. On such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, accompanied by lows often below {{convert|15|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around {{convert|34|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like {{convert|39|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, as on [[Paulista Avenue]] for example. In the summer of 2014, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, peaking on {{convert|36|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Secondary to [[deforestation]], [[groundwater pollution]], and [[climate change]], São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to [[drought]] and [[water shortage]]s.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Romero |first=Simon |date=February 16, 2015 |title=Taps Start to Run Dry in Brazil's Largest City – São Paulo Water Crisis Linked to Growth, Pollution and Deforestation |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world/americas/drought-pushes-sao-paulo-brazil-toward-water-crisis.html?_r=0 |url-status=live |access-date=February 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219140841/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world/americas/drought-pushes-sao-paulo-brazil-toward-water-crisis.html?_r=0 |archive-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref>

Due to the altitude of the city, there are only few hot nights in São Paulo even in the summer months, with minimum temperatures rarely exceeding {{convert|21|°C}}. In winter, however, the strong inflow of [[cold fronts]] accompanied by excessive cloudiness and polar air cause fairly low temperatures, even in the afternoon.

Afternoons with maximum temperatures ranging between {{convert|13|and|15|C|F}} are common even during the fall and early spring. During the winter, there have been several recent records of cold afternoons, as on July 24, 2013 in which the maximum temperature was {{convert|8|°C}} and the [[wind chill]] hit {{convert|0|°C}} during the afternoon.

São Paulo is known for its rapidly changing weather. Locals say that all four seasons can be experienced in one day, similar to [[Melbourne, Australia]]. In the morning, when winds blow from the ocean, the weather can be cool or sometimes even cold. When the sun hits its peak, the weather can be extremely dry and hot. When the sun sets, the cold wind comes back bringing cool temperatures. This phenomenon happens usually in the winter.

São Paulo is considered the most [[multicultural]] city in Brazil. From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million [[immigrants]] arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the 9 million inhabitants of São Paulo, 50% (4.5 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry. São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any Italian city (the largest city of [[Italy]] is [[Rome]], with 2.8 million inhabitants).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tudo sobre São Paulo SP |url=http://www.encontrasaopaulo.com.br/sobre-sao-paulo.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323153154/http://www.encontrasaopaulo.com.br/sobre-sao-paulo.html |archive-date=March 23, 2016 |access-date=March 25, 2016 |publisher=EncontraSP}}</ref>

Even today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like [[Bixiga]], [[Brás]], and [[Mooca (district of São Paulo)|Mooca]] to promote celebrations and festivals. In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] in the city, which influenced the formation of the São Paulo dialect of today. Six thousand pizzerias are producing about a million pizzas a day. Brazil has the largest [[Italians|Italian population]] outside [[Italy]], with São Paulo being the most populous city with Italian ancestry in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brazil – the Country and its People |url=http://www.brazil.org.uk/resources/documents/bs-primary03.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021152752/http://www.brazil.org.uk/resources/documents/bs-primary03.pdf |archive-date=October 21, 2014 |access-date=November 26, 2014 |publisher=www.brazil.org.uk}}</ref>

The Portuguese community is also large; it is estimated that three million paulistanos have some origin in [[Portugal]]. The Jewish colony is more than 80,000 people in São Paulo and is concentrated mainly in [[Higienópolis, São Paulo|Higienópolis]] and [[Bom Retiro (district of São Paulo)|Bom Retiro]].<ref name="forbesimi" />

From the nineteenth century through the first half of the twentieth century, São Paulo also received [[Germans|German]] immigrants (in the current neighborhood of [[Santo Amaro, São Paulo|Santo Amaro]]), [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] (in the neighborhood [[Vila Zelina]]).<ref name="forbesimi">{{Cite news |last=Geromel |first=Ricardo |title=Jun Sakamoto, One of America's Top Sushi Chef, Shares 11 Key Ingredients Of The Recipe For Success |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ricardogeromel/2013/08/17/jun-sakamoto-one-of-americas-top-sushi-chef-shares-12-key-ingredients-of-the-recipe-for-success/#b2c87a22f995 |url-status=live |access-date=February 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211084633/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ricardogeromel/2013/08/17/jun-sakamoto-one-of-americas-top-sushi-chef-shares-12-key-ingredients-of-the-recipe-for-success/#b2c87a22f995 |archive-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref>

São Paulo is not only home to the largest Japanese diaspora – over 1.5 million Japanese descendants live in São Paulo – but it also has over 600 Japanese restaurants (20% more than "[[churrascaria]]s" – Brazilian steakhouses) where more than 12 millions sushis are sold every month.

'' A French observer, travelling to São Paulo at the time, noted that there was a division of the capitalist class, by nationality (...) Germans, French and Italians shared the dry goods sector with Brazilians. Foodstuffs was generally the province of either Portuguese or Brazilians, except for bakery and pastry which was the domain of the French and Germans. Shoes and tinware were mostly controlled by Italians. However, the larger metallurgical plants were in the hands of the English and the Americans. (...) Italians outnumbered Brazilians two to one in São Paulo.''<ref>{{Cite book |url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=lw3iPzyfpdQC|page=327 }} |title=World Cities beyond the West: Globalization, Development and Inequality |date=October 14, 2004 |access-date=December 1, 2012}}</ref>

Until 1920, 1,078,437 [[Italians]] entered in the [[State of São Paulo]]. Of the immigrants who arrived there between 1887 and 1902, 63.5% came from Italy. Between 1888 and 1919, 44.7% of the immigrants were Italians, 19.2% were [[Spaniards]] and 15.4% were [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].<ref name="100 anos de imigração">{{Cite book |url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=ncc7WLAXlmQC|page=100 }} |title=Do outro lado do AtlРntico: um sжculo de imigraусo italiana no Brasil – Angelo Trento |access-date=December 1, 2012}}</ref> In 1920, nearly 80% of São Paulo city's population was composed of immigrants and their descendants and Italians made up over half of its male population.<ref name="100 anos de imigração" /> At that time, the Governor of São Paulo said that ''"if the owner of each house in São Paulo display the flag of the country of origin on the roof, from above São Paulo would look like an Italian city".'' In 1900, a columnist who was absent from São Paulo for 20 years wrote ''"then São Paulo used to be a genuine Paulista city, today it is an Italian city."''<ref name="100 anos de imigração" />

Research conducted by the [[University of São Paulo]] (USP) shows the city's high ethnic diversity: when asked if they are "descendants of foreign immigrants", 81% of the students reported "yes". The main reported ancestries were: Italian (30.5%), Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German (6%), ''Brazilian'' (4%), African (3%), Arab (2%) and Jewish (1%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Universidade de São Paulo |url=http://www.fflch.usp.br/sociologia/asag/relatorio_substantivo.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421204230/http://www.fflch.usp.br/sociologia/asag/relatorio_substantivo.pdf |archive-date=April 21, 2012 |access-date=December 1, 2012 |publisher=Fflch.usp.br}}</ref>

The city once attracted numerous immigrants from all over Brazil and even from foreign countries, due to a strong economy and for being the hub of most Brazilian companies.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 26, 2006 |title=Curitiba é eleita a melhor cidade para investimento |url=http://www.bonde.com.br/economia/noticias/curitiba-e-eleita-a-melhor-cidade-para-investimento-68562.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929183528/http://www.bonde.com.br/economia/noticias/curitiba-e-eleita-a-melhor-cidade-para-investimento-68562.html |archive-date=September 29, 2017 |access-date=September 29, 2017 |website=Bonde}}</ref>

===Domestic migration===
Since the 19th century people began migrating from northeastern Brazil into São Paulo. This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in [[cortiço]]s, in slums ([[favela]]s) of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, [[Bom Retiro, São Paulo|Bom Retiro]], [[Cambuci]], Pari and [[Sé (district of São Paulo)|Sé]]). In this area they composed 41% of the population.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=Dec 2006 |title=Uma inserção dos migrantes nordestinos em São Paulo: o comércio de retalhos |trans-title=An insertion of northeastern migrants in São Paulo: the retail trade |url=http://pepsic.bvs-psi.org.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-666X2006000200007&lng=pt&nrm=Uma |url-status=dead |journal=Imaginário |language=pt |location=São Paulo |volume=12 |issn=1413-666X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515170608/http://pepsic.bvs-psi.org.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-666X2006000200007&lng=pt&nrm=Uma |archive-date=May 15, 2012 |access-date=January 30, 2012 |number=13}}</ref>

Like the cultural variety verifiable in São Paulo, there are several religious manifestations present in the city. Although it has developed on an eminently [[Catholic]] social matrix, both due to colonization and immigration – and even today most of the people of São Paulo declare themselves Roman Catholic – it is possible to find in the city dozens of different Protestant denominations, as well as the practice of [[Islam]], [[Spiritism]], among others. [[Buddhism]] and Eastern religions also have relevance among the beliefs most practiced by Paulistanos. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred thousand [[Buddhist]] followers and Hindu. Also considerable are [[Judaism]], [[Mormonism]] and [[Afro-Brazilian religions]].

According to data from the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), in 2010 the population of São Paulo was 6,549,775 [[Roman Catholics]] (58.2%), 2,887,810 [[Protestants]] (22.1%), 531,822 [[Spiritists]] (4.7 percent), 101,493 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (0.9 percent), 75,075 [[Buddhists]] (0.7 percent), 50,794 [[Umbanda|Umbandists]] (0.5 percent), 43,610 [[Jews]] (0.4 percent), 28,673 [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church|Catholic Apostolic Brazilians]] (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 [[Candomblé|candomblecists]] (0.2%), 17,321 [[Mormons]] (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 [[spiritualists]] (0.1%), 8,277 [[Muslims]] (0.1%), 7,139 [[esoteric]] (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were [[Hindu]] (<0.1%).

The Catholic Church divides the territory of the municipality of São Paulo into four ecclesiastical circumscriptions: the [[Archdiocese of São Paulo]], and the adjacent Diocese of Santo Amaro, the Diocese of São Miguel Paulista and the Diocese of Campo Limpo, the last three suffragans of the first. The archive of the archdiocese, called the Metropolitan Archival Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, in the [[Ipiranga (district of São Paulo)|Ipiranga]] neighborhood, holds one of the most important documentary heritage in Brazil. The archiepiscopal is the [[São Paulo Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral of São Paulo]] (known as Sé Cathedral), in [[Praça da Sé]], considered one of the five largest [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] temples in the world. The Catholic Church recognizes as patron saints of the city [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul of Tarsus]] and [[Our Lady of Peñafrancia|Our Lady of Penha of France]].

The city has the most diverse Protestant or Reformed creeds, such as the Evangelical Community of Our Land, Maranatha Christian Church, [[Lutheran Church]], [[Presbyterian Church]], [[Methodist Church]], [[Anglican Episcopal Church]], [[Baptist church]]es, Assembly Church of God, The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the World Church of God's Power, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others, as well as Christians of various denominations.

===Public security===

[[File:Formacaodapmesp.jpg|thumb|left|Training of soldiers of the [[Military Police of São Paulo State]] at the Military Police Academy of Barro Branco.]]

According to the 2011 Global Homicide Survey released by the [[United Nations]], in the period between 2004 and 2009 the homicide rate dropped from 20.8 to 10.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. The UN pointed to São Paulo as an example of how big cities can reduce crime. [[Crime rates]], such as [[homicide]], have been steadily declining for 8 years. The number of murders in 2007 was 63% lower than in 1999. Carandiru's 9th DP is considered one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in [[Latin America]].

In 2008, the city of São Paulo ranked 493rd in the list of the most violent cities in Brazil. Among the capitals, it was the fourth least violent, registering, in 2006, homicide rates higher than those of [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]], [[Palmas, Tocantins|Palmas]] and [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]].

In a survey on the [[Adolescent Homicide Index]] (IHA), released in 2009, São Paulo ranked 151st among 267 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. In November 2009, the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Forum of Public Security published a survey that pointed to São Paulo as the safest Brazilian capital for young people. Between 2000 and 2010, the city of São Paulo reduced its homicide rate by 78%. According to data from the Map of Violence 2011, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city of São Paulo has the lowest homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants among all Brazilian capitals.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two [[World war|World Wars]] and the [[Great Depression]], coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.
* [[Crime statistics|Crime rates]] consistently decreased in the 21st century. The citywide homicide rate was 6.56 in 2019, less than a fourth of the 27.38 national rate.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 24, 2020 |title=Homicídios dolosos caem em SP, mas mortes por policiais têm alta |url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/homicidios-dolosos-caem-em-sp-mas-mortes-por-policiais-tem-alta.shtml |access-date=July 1, 2020 |website=Folha de S.Paulo |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Brazil}}

The primary language is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. The general language from São Paulo General, or [[Tupi language|Tupi Austral]] (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from [[Marquess of Pombal]], Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original [[Tupi Austral]] language subsequently lost ground to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of [[Japanese Brazilians|Japanese]], [[German Brazilians|German]], [[Brazilians of Spanish descent|Spanish]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]] and [[Arab Brazilian|Arab]] immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.
[[File:Interior do Museu da Língua Portuguesa em São Paulo, Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|[[Museum of the Portuguese Language]].]]

The Italian influence in São Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, [[Mooca (district of São Paulo)|Mooca]], [[Brás]] and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of [[Adoniran Barbosa]], a Brazilian [[samba]] singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo%3D12097 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154937/http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo=12097 |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |title=A linguagem ítalo-brasileira {{!}} Revista Língua Portuguesa |access-date=April 8, 2021}}</ref>

Other languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Although today most Japanese-Brazilians speak only Portuguese, some of them are still fluent in Japanese. Some people of Chinese and Korean descent are still able to speak their ancestral languages.<ref>{{cite web |title=ELB |url=http://www.labeurb.unicamp.br/elb/asiaticas/asiaticas.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502125515/http://www.labeurb.unicamp.br/elb/asiaticas/asiaticas.htm |archive-date=May 2, 2009 |access-date=May 6, 2009 |publisher=Labeurb.unicamp.br}}</ref> In some areas it is still possible to find descendants of immigrants who speak German<ref>{{cite web |title=Alemães ajudaram a formar a classe média paulistana &#124; Alemanha &#124; DW.DE &#124; 26.05.2004 |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1213337,00.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221034830/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1213337,00.html |archive-date=February 21, 2011 |access-date=December 1, 2012 |publisher=Dw-world.de}}</ref> (especially in the area of Brooklin paulista) and Russian or East European languages (especially in the area of Vila Zelina).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historias |url=http://amoviza.org.br/historias.asp |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012002659/http://www.amoviza.org.br/historias.asp |archive-date=October 12, 2012 |access-date=December 1, 2012 |publisher=Amoviza.org.br}}</ref> In the west zone of São Paulo, specially at Vila Anastácio and Lapa region, there is a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] colony, with three churches (Calvinist, Baptist and Catholic), so on Sundays it is possible to see Hungarians talking to each other on sidewalks.

Strongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, in 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$1 million reais in the parade and provided a solid security plan, with approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. The parade, considered the city's second largest event after the [[Formula One]], begins at the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]], crosses [[Paulista Avenue]], and follows Consolação Street to [[Praça Roosevelt]] in [[Downtown São Paulo]]. According to the LGBT app [[Grindr]], the gay parade of the city was elected the best in the world.<ref>[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2012/04/grindr_awards_f.php Grindr Awards For Gayest Cities, Beaches, And Marital Destinations {{in lang|en}}] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415190718/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2012/04/grindr_awards_f.php |date=April 15, 2012}}</ref>

As the capital of the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], the city is home to the Bandeirantes Palace (state government) and the Legislative Assembly. The Executive Branch of the municipality of São Paulo is represented by the [[mayor]] and his cabinet of secretaries, following the model proposed by the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web |title=São Paulo, da taipa ao concreto |url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=2979 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522102955/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=2979 |archive-date=May 22, 2016 |access-date=March 29, 2012 |publisher=Prefeitura de São Paulo}}</ref> The organic law of the municipality and the Master Plan of the city, however, determine that the public administration must guarantee to the population effective tools of manifestation of participatory democracy, which causes that the city is divided in regional prefectures, each one led by a Regional Mayor appointed by the Mayor.<ref name="districts" />

The legislative power is represented by the Municipal Chamber, composed of 55 aldermen elected to four-year posts (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Constitution, which dictates a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants). It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the municipal budget (known as the Law of Budgetary Guidelines).<ref>{{Cite web |title=LDO – Lei de Diretrizes Orçamentárias |url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/relacoes_internacionais/sao_paulo_cidade_global/index.php?p=1193 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119045205/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/relacoes_internacionais/sao_paulo_cidade_global/index.php?p=1193 |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |access-date=March 29, 2012 |publisher=Prefeitura de São Paulo}}</ref> In addition to the legislative process and the work of the secretariats, there are also a number of municipal councils, each dealing with different topics, composed of representatives of the various sectors of organized civil society. The actual performance and representativeness of such councils, however, are sometimes questioned.

The following municipal councils are active: Municipal Council for Children and Adolescents (CMDCA); of Informatics (WCC); of the Physically Disabled (CMDP); of Education (CME); of Housing (CMH); of Environment (CADES); of Health (CMS); of Tourism (COMTUR); of Human Rights (CMDH); of Culture (CMC); and of Social Assistance (COMAS) and Drugs and Alcohol (COMUDA). The Prefecture also owns (or is the majority partner in their social capital) a series of companies responsible for various aspects of public services and the economy of São Paulo:
* [[Anhembi Convention Center|''São Paulo Turismo S/A'']] (SPTuris): company responsible for organizing large events and promoting the city's tourism.
* ''Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego'' (CET):<ref>{{Cite web |title=CET - Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego |url=http://www.cetsp.com.br/ |access-date=July 17, 2020 |website=www.cetsp.com.br}}</ref> subordinated to the Municipal Transportation Department, is responsible for traffic supervision, fines (in cooperation with DETRAN) and maintenance of the city's road system.
* ''Companhia Metropolitana de Habitação de São Paulo'' (COHAB): subordinate to the Department of Housing, is responsible for the implementation of public housing policies, especially the construction of housing developments.
* ''Empresa Municipal de Urbanização de São Paulo'' (EMURB): subordinate to the Planning Department, is responsible for urban works and for the maintenance of public spaces and urban furniture.
* ''Companhia de Processamento de Dados de São Paulo'' (PRODAM): responsible for the electronic infrastructure and information technology of the city hall.
* [[SPTrans|''São Paulo Transportes Sociedade Anônima'']] (SPTrans): responsible for the operation of the public transport systems managed by the city hall, such as the municipal bus lines.

===Subdivisions===
São Paulo is divided into 32 sub-prefectures, each with an administration ("subprefeitura") divided into several districts ("distritos").<ref name="districts">{{Cite web |title=Website of São Paulo City Hall |url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/subprefeituras/subprefeituras/index.php?p=8978 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705112812/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/subprefeituras/subprefeituras/index.php?p=8978 |archive-date=July 5, 2016 |access-date=June 27, 2016}}</ref> The city also has a radial division into nine zones for purpose of traffic control and bus lines, which don't fit into the administrative divisions. These zones are identified by colors in the street signs. The historical core of São Paulo, which includes the inner city and the area of [[Paulista Avenue]], is in the [[Subprefecture of Sé]]. Most other economic and tourist facilities of the city are inside an area officially called ''Centro Expandido'' (Portuguese for "Broad Center", or "Broad Downtown"), which includes Sé and several other subprefectures, and areas immediately around it.

The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.

São Paulo is practically all served by the water supply network. The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as [[Parelheiros (district of São Paulo)|Parelheiros]] and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as [[Caieiras]] and [[Guarulhos]].<ref name="lixo">{{Cite web |date=May 14, 2010 |title=A sustentabilidade urbana |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/estadaodehoje/20100514/not_imp551610,0.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20110706100614/http://www.estadao.com.br/estadaodehoje/20100514/not_imp551610,0.php |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |access-date=May 9, 2017 |publisher=O Estado de S.

===Urban fabrics===
São Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of [[New York City]] and [[Hong Kong]]), however, São Paulo is considered a "low-rise building" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings ''Emporis Buildings'',<ref>{{Cite web |title=Skyline Ranking |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/sr/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005151/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/06/12/afx3810988.html |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |access-date=May 9, 2017 |publisher=Emporis.com}}</ref> besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the [[Mirante do Vale]], also known as ''Palácio Zarzur Kogan'', with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nogueira |first=Sylvio Rocha |title=A verticalização predial e o melhor urbanismo brasileiro |url=http://www.revistasim.com.br/asp/materia.asp?idtexto=1136 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707053521/http://www.revistasim.com.br/asp/materia.asp?idtexto=1136 |archive-date=July 7, 2009 |access-date=May 9, 2017 |publisher=Revista SIM }}</ref>

Such tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, [[drug trafficking]], street vending and [[prostitution]], which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.<ref name="Planejamento">{{Cite web |last=Indriunas |first=Luís |editor-last=[[HowStuffWorks]] |title=Planejamento urbano em São Paulo |url=http://pessoas.hsw.uol.com.br/sao-paulo-urbanismo.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221153559/http://pessoas.hsw.uol.com.br/sao-paulo-urbanismo.htm |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |access-date=May 9, 2017 }}</ref>

The constant change of the landscape of São Paulo due to the technological changes of its buildings has been a striking feature of the city, pointed out by scholars. In a period of a century, between the middle of 1870 and 1970 the city of São Paulo was "practically demolished and rebuilt at least three times". These three periods are characterized by the typical constructive processes of their times.

===Urban planning===
[[File:São Paulo - Planet Imagery.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Changes in urban fabrics in the region of [[Jardins]]: side by side, vertical areas and low houses]]

São Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.<ref>{{Cite web |title=São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil |url=http://friendsite.com/hardwarezone/blog/16972/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+is+the+largest+city+in+Brazil.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106065345/http://friendsite.com/hardwarezone/blog/16972/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+is+the+largest+city+in+Brazil.html |archive-date=January 6, 2016 |access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref>

Urban growth in São Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th Century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.<ref name="Caldeira, Teresa P.R. 2000. p. 215">[Caldeira, Teresa P.R. "City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in São Paulo," University of California Press, 2000. Berkeley. (p. 215)]</ref>

Thus, São Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Goiânia]], whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like [[Brasília]], whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=São Paulo |url=http://pt.scribd.com/doc/134833915/Sao-Paulo |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106065345/http://pt.scribd.com/doc/134833915/Sao-Paulo |archive-date=January 6, 2016 |access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:São Paulo view.jpg|thumb|Vale do Anhangabaú, in [[Central Zone of São Paulo|Downtown]]]]

The effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In São Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of "demolish and rebuild", including former Mayor [[Francisco Prestes Maia|Francisco Prestes Maia's]] road plan for São Paulo (known as the Avenues Plan) or [[Saturnino de Brito|Saturnino de Brito's]] plan for the Tietê River.

The Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods. The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.<ref>[Moreira dos Santos, Laerte. "Expansao Urbana da Cidade de São Paulo e a Segregacao Socio-Espacial Durante o Periodo de 1850–1992" Instituto Federal de São Paulo, 1992]</ref> This contributed to the outwards expansion of São Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self-built single-family houses.<ref name="Caldeira, Teresa P.R. 2000. p. 215" />

In 1968 the Urban Development Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of São Paulo, under the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz. The main result was zoning laws. It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master Plan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=São Paulo, Brazil. |url=http://wewantsexualfreedom.com/?p=32987 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018200142/http://www.wewantsexualfreedom.com/?p=32987 |archive-date=October 18, 2015 |access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref>

That zoning, adopted in 1972, designated "Z1" areas ([[residential area]]s designed for elites) and "Z3" (a "mixed zone" lacking clear definitions about their characteristics). Zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with minimal control and major speculation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=AsianAve.com – hardwarezone's Blog |url=http://www.asianave.com/your_page/blog/index.html?profile_id=17935585&profile_name=hardwarezone&user_id=17935585&username=hardwarezone&m=January&y=2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018200139/http://www.asianave.com/your_page/blog/index.html?profile_id=17935585&profile_name=hardwarezone&user_id=17935585&username=hardwarezone&m=January&y=2012 |archive-date=October 18, 2015 |access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref>

After the 1970s peripheral lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved, driving land prices up. The poorest and the newcomers now could not purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a housing alternative. As a result, [[favela]]s and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared.<ref>[Caldeira, Teresa P.R. ''City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in São Paulo'', University of California Press, 2000. Berkeley.]</ref> These housing types were often closer to the city's center: favelas could sprawl in any unused terrain (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.<ref>Da Gama Torres, Heraldo, et. al. "Pobreza e espaco: padroes de segregacao em São Paulo," Estud. av.[online]. 2003</ref>

By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in [[favelas]], compared to 5.2% in 1980.<ref>[Fix, Mariana, et al. "Urban Slums Report: The Case of São Paulo, Brazil" in Understanding Slums: Case Studies for the Global Report on Human Settlements 2003.

São Paulo has two main airports, [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport]] {{Airport codes|GRU}} for international flights and national hub, and [[Congonhas-São Paulo Airport]] {{Airport codes|CGH}} for domestic and regional flights. Another airport, the [[Campo de Marte Airport]], serves private jets and light aircraft. The three airports together moved more than 58.000.000 passengers in 2015, making São Paulo one of the top 15 busiest in the world, by number of air passenger movements. The region of Greater São Paulo is also served by [[Viracopos-Campinas International Airport]], [[São José dos Campos Airport]] and [[Jundiaí Airport]].

Congonhas Airport operates flights mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. In the latest upgrade, twelve new [[boarding (transport)|boarding]] bridges increase passenger comfort by eliminating the need to walk in the open to their flights. The terminal area was expanded from {{convert|37.3|e3m2|1|abbr=off|sp=us}} to over {{convert|70|e3m2|abbr=off|sp=us}}. This expansion raised capacity to almost 18&nbsp;million users. Built in the 1930s, it was designed to handle the increasing demand for flights, in the fastest growing city in the world. Located in Campo Belo District, Congonhas Airport is close to the three main city's financial districts: [[Paulista Avenue]], [[Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue]] and [[Engenheiro Luís Carlos Berrini Avenue]].

São Paulo–Guarulhos International, also known as "Cumbica" is {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of the city center, in the neighboring city of [[Guarulhos]]. Every day nearly 110.000 people pass through the airport, which connects Brazil to 36 countries around the world. 370 companies operate there, generating more than 53.000 jobs. With capacity to serve 42&nbsp;million passengers a year, in three terminals, the airport handles 40&nbsp;million users.

Construction of a third passenger terminal was completed in time for the 2014 World Cup, and raised yearly capacity to 42&nbsp;million passengers. The project is part of the airport's master plan, which will, by the end of 2032, increase the airport capacity to nearly 60&nbsp;million passengers. [https://www.saopaulointernationalairport.com/ São Paulo International Airport] is also the main air cargo [[Transport hub|hubs]] in Brazil. The roughly 150 flights a day carry everything from fruits grown in the São Francisco Valley to locally manufactured medicine and electronics devices.

São Paulo has three [[urban rail transit]] systems: the [[São Paulo Metro]] (locally known as the ''Metrô''), an [[Rapid transit|underground]] system with six lines, which includes the [[monorail]] of the [[Line 15 (São Paulo Metro)|Line 15 (Silver)]], and the [[commuter rail]] system of the [[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos]] (CPTM), with seven lines that serve cities in the metropolitan region. The underground and railway lines together carry some 7 million people on an average weekday.<ref>There are 8 subway lines in construction or expansion, which will connect the two main airport and several business districts, along with others metropolitan cities.

The two major São Paulo [[railway stations]] are Luz and Julio Prestes in the Luz/Campos Eliseos region. [[Estação Júlio Prestes|Julio Prestes Station]] connected Southwest São Paulo State and Northern [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] State to São Paulo City. Agricultural products were transferred to Luz Station from which they headed to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and overseas. Julio Prestes stopped transporting passengers through the Sorocabana or FEPASA lines and now only has metro service. Due to its acoustics and interior beauty, surrounded by Greek revival columns, part of the rebuilt station was transformed into the São Paulo Hall.

[[Luz Station]] was built in Britain and assembled in Brazil. It has an underground station and is still active with metro lines that link São Paulo to the Greater São Paulo region to the East and the Campinas Metropolitan region in Jundiaí in the western part of the State. Luz Station is surrounded by important [[culture|cultural]] institutions such as the [[Pinacoteca do Estado]], The Museu de Arte Sacra on Tiradentes Avenue and Jardim da Luz, among others. It is the seat of the Santos-[[Jundiaí]] line which historically transported [[Immigration to Brazil|international immigrants]] from the [[Port of Santos]] to São Paulo and the coffee plantation lands in the Western region of [[Campinas]]. São Paulo has no [[tram]] lines, although trams were common in the first half of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=São Paulo |url=http://www.tramz.com/br/tto/6SP1.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412070846/http://tramz.com/br/tto/6SP1.html |archive-date=April 12, 2013 |access-date=December 1, 2012 |publisher=Tramz.com}}</ref>

[[Adoniran Barbosa]] was a [[samba]] singer and composer who became successful during São Paulo's early radio era. Born in 1912 in the town of [[Valinhos]], Barbosa was known as the "composer to the masses", particularly Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bela Vista, also known as "Bexiga" and Brás, as well as those who lived in the city's many 'cortiços' or tenements. His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first big hit was "Saudosa Maloca" ("Shanty of Fond Memories" – 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 [[Trem das Onze]] ("The 11&nbsp;pm Train"), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the [[Jaçanã (district of São Paulo)|Jaçanã suburb]], for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home. Another important musician with a similar style is [[Paulo Vanzolini]]. Vanzolini is a PhD in Biology and a part-time professional musician. He composed a song depicting a love murder scene in São Paulo called "Ronda".

In the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock band called [[Os Mutantes]] became popular. Their success is related to that of other [[tropicalismo|tropicalia]] musicians. The group was known as very ''paulistanos'' in its behavior and clothing. Os Mutantes released five albums before lead singer [[Rita Lee]] departed in 1972 to join another group called [[Tutti Frutti (Brazilian band)|Tutti Frutti]]. Although initially known only in Brazil, Os Mutantes became successful abroad after the 1990s. In 2000, ''[[Tecnicolor]]'', an album recorded in the early 1970s in English by the band, was released with artwork designed by [[Sean Lennon]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Music – Culture – About SP – Governo do Estado de São Paulo |url=http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/conhecasp/cultura_musica.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105426/http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/conhecasp/cultura_musica.php |archive-date=April 24, 2015 |access-date=May 23, 2015 }}</ref>

In the early 1980s, a band called ''[[Ultraje a Rigor]]'' (Elegant Outrage) emerged. They played a simple and irreverent style of rock. The lyrics depicted the changes in society and culture that Brazilian society was experiencing. A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment during an extended recession. Bands originating from this movement include [[Ira!]], [[Titãs]], [[Ratos de Porão]] and [[Inocentes]]. In the 1990s, [[drum and bass]] arose as another musical movement in São Paulo, with artists such as [[DJ Marky]], [[DJ Patife]], [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]], [[Drumagick]] and [[Fernanda Porto]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 18, 2009 |title=Movement website |url=http://www.movement.co.uk/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504090151/http://movement.co.uk/ |archive-date=May 4, 2010 |access-date=April 17, 2010 |publisher=Movement.co.uk}}</ref> Many [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands also originated in São Paulo, such as [[Angra (band)|Angra]], [[Project46]], [[Torture Squad]], Korzus and [[Dr. Sin]].

São Paulo was home to the first [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries in Brazil, in the early 16th century. They wrote reports to the Portuguese crown about the newly found land, the [[Indigenous peoples|native peoples]] and composed poetry and music for the [[catechism]], creating the first written works from the area. The literary priests included [[Manuel da Nóbrega]] and [[José de Anchieta]], living in or near the colony then called ''Piratininga''. They also helped to register the [[Old Tupi language]], lexicon and its grammar.
In 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in São Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural [[independence]] came more gradually.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mexico at the World's Fairs |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2k4004k4&chunk.id=d0e5397&toc.id=d0e5397&brand=ucpress |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317220302/http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2k4004k4&chunk.id=d0e5397&toc.id=d0e5397&brand=ucpress |archive-date=March 17, 2015 |access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref>

Brazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to [[Culture of Portugal|Portugal]]. Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work that was distinctively Brazilian. The presence of large numbers of former slaves added a distinctive [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] character to the [[Culture of Brazil|culture]]. Subsequent infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of influences.<ref name="Modernism" />

[[Mário de Andrade]] and [[Oswald de Andrade]] were the prototypical modernists. With the urban poems of "Paulicéia Desvairada" and "Carefree Paulistan land" (1922), Mário de Andrade established the [[Cultural movement|movement]] in Brazil. His rhapsodic novel ''Macunaíma'' (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian [[folklore]], represents the apex of [[modernism]]'s nationalist prose through its creation of an offbeat native [[hero|national hero]]. Oswald de Andrade's experimental poetry, [[avant-garde]] prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and provocative manifestos exemplify the movement's break with tradition.<ref name="Modernism" />

Modernist artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo to launch their Modernist manifesto. The site happened to be a bastion of European culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, Austria and Italy. They defied the high society that frequented the venue and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving as if Brazilian culture did not matter.<ref name="Modernism">{{Cite web |last=noicols |date=July 12, 2013 |title=São Paulo Culture |url=http://sasopaulo.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/culture.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201212813/http://sasopaulo.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/culture.html |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |access-date=July 22, 2014 |publisher=Sasopaulo.blogspot.com.br}}</ref>

===Theaters===
Many historians believe that the first theatrical performance in Brazil was held in São Paulo. The Portuguese [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[José de Anchieta]] (1534–1597) wrote short plays that were performed and watched by the Tupi–Guarani natives. In the second half of the 19th century a cultural, musical and theatrical life emerged. [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European ethnic groups]] began holding performances in some of the state's rural cities. The most important period for the art in São Paulo was the 1940s. São Paulo had had a professional company, Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, (Brazilian Theater of Comedy), along with others.
[[File:Teatro Municipal de São Paulo 8.jpg|thumb|left|[[Municipal Theatre of São Paulo]]]]

During the 1960s, major theater productions in São Paulo and Brazil were presented by two groups. Teatro de Arena began with a group of students from Escola de Arte Dramática (Drama [[Art school|Art School]]), founded by Alfredo Mesquita, in 1948. In 1958, the group excelled with the play "Eles não usam black tie" by [[Gianfrancesco Guarnieri]] which was the first in the history of the Brazilian drama to feature [[Wage labour|labor]] [[Laborer|workers]] as [[protagonist]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Theaters – Culture – About SP – Governo do Estado de São Paulo |url=http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/conhecasp/cultura_teatros.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424112445/http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/conhecasp/cultura_teatros.php |archive-date=April 24, 2015 |access-date=May 23, 2015 }}</ref>

After the military coup of 1964, plays started focusing on [[History of Brazil|Brazilian history]] (Zumbi, Tiradentes). Teatro de Arena and Teatro Oficina supported the democratic resistance during the [[military dictatorship]] period, marked by its censorship. The Tropicalist movement began there. A number of plays represented [[history|historic]] moments, notably "O Rei da Vela", "Galileu Galilei" (1968), "Na Sela das Cidades" (1969) and "Gracias Señor" (1972).

The district of Bixiga concentrates the greatest number of [[theater]]s, around 40 including the theaters that are closed for refurbishing or for other reasons, and small alternatives companies venues. Some of the most important are Renault, Brigadeiro, Zaccaro, [[Bibi Ferreira]], Maria della Costa, Ruth Escobar, Opera, TBC, Imprensa, Oficina, Àgora, Cacilda Becker, Sérgio Cardoso, do Bixiga, and Bandeirantes.

From 1882 to 1978, 2.5&nbsp;million immigrants of more than 60 nationalities and ethnicities were guests there,<ref name="Hospedaria dos Imigrantes 1885">{{Cite web |title=Hospedaria dos Imigrantes (1885) |url=http://www.aprenda450anos.com.br/450anos/vila_metropole/2-2_hospedaria_imigrantes.asp# |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714035111/http://www.aprenda450anos.com.br/450anos/vila_metropole/2-2_hospedaria_imigrantes.asp |archive-date=July 14, 2009 |access-date=April 17, 2010 |publisher=Aprenda450anos.com.br}}</ref> all of them duly registered in the museum's books and lists.

In 1998 the hostel became a museum, where it preserves the immigrants' documentation, memory and objects. Located in one of the few remaining centenarian buildings, the museum occupies part of the former hostel. The museum also restores wooden train wagons from the former [[São Paulo Railway]]. Two restored wagons inhabit the museum. One dates from 1914, while a second class passenger car dates from 1931. The museum records the names of all immigrants who were hosted there from 1888 to 1978.<ref>[http://www.memorialdoimigrante.org.br/ahc/index.htm Acervo Histórico-Cultural]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323232658/http://www.memorialdoimigrante.org.br/ahc/index.htm |date=March 23, 2009 }}</ref>
