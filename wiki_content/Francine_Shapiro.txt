'''Francine Shapiro'''  (February 18, 1948 – June 16, 2019) was an American [[psychologist]] and educator who originated and developed [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] (EMDR), a form of psychotherapy for resolving the symptoms of traumatic and other disturbing life experiences.<ref>Shapiro, F. & Solomon, R.

In 1987, she had an experience walking through a park that ignited the chance observation that moving her eyes from side to side appeared to reduce the disturbance of negative thoughts and memories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emdr.com/history-of-emdr/|title=History of EMDR |website=EMDR.com |access-date=February 21, 2018 }}</ref>  This experience led her to examine this phenomenon more systematically.  Working with approximately 70 volunteers, she developed standardized procedures to maximize therapeutic outcomes, conducted additional research and published a randomized controlled study with trauma victims.<ref name="Shapiro, F. 1989">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jts.2490020207|title=Efficacy of the eye movement desensitization procedure in the treatment of traumatic memories|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|volume=2|issue=2|pages=199–223|year=1989|last1=Shapiro|first1=Francine}}</ref>  After further research and elaboration of the methodology, she published a textbook in 1995 detailing the eight phases of this form of psychotherapy.<ref>Shapiro, F.

==Early life==
Shapiro was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Dan, who managed a garage and a fleet of taxis, and his wife, Shirley. The death of her younger sister Debra at the age of nine affected her deeply.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/15/francine-shapiro-obituary|title = Francine Shapiro obituary|date=July 15, 2019 }}</ref>

==Education==
Shapiro held a BA (1968) and MA (1974) in English Literature from [[Brooklyn College]], [[City University of New York]]. In 1974, while employed full-time as a high school English teacher, she enrolled in a PhD program in English Literature at [[New York University]]. In 1979, having completed all but her dissertation, she was diagnosed with cancer. Shapiro travelled,<ref name="theguardian.com"/> then settled in San Diego and set up a nonprofit organization, Human Development Institute, along with Shirley Phares-Kime.<ref>{{cite news |last=McLean |first=Dan |title=Aiming at Superachievers NLP: Influencing Anybody to Do Just About Anything |work= Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, California |date=February 13, 1985 |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-02-13-vw-4747-story.html |access-date=July 2, 2019 }}</ref>

Her post-recovery experiences shifted her attention from literature to the [[Stress (biology)#Effect of stress on the immune system|effects of stress on the immune system]], based on the work of [[Norman Cousins]] and others.<ref>Cousins, N. (1979). Anatomy of an illness as perceived by the patient: Reflections on healing . NY: Norton</ref>

Over the next few years she participated in numerous workshops and programs exploring various stress reduction and self-care procedures. During that time, she enrolled in the Professional School of Psychological Studies, San Diego (which was not regionally accredited, but was approved by the state of California for psychologist licensure and is now defunct).<ref>{{cite web |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |title=Diploma mill |url=http://www.skepdic.com/diplomamill.html |access-date=December 28, 2011 |quote=Dr. Francine Shapiro--the creator of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy--got her doctorate from the now defunct and never accredited Professional School of Psychological Studies.}}</ref><ref>California Postsecondary Education Commission (1990).

She received her PhD in 1988, and her thesis was published in the ''Journal of Traumatic Studies'' in 1989,<ref name="Shapiro, F. 1989"/>  followed by an invited article that was published in the ''Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry''.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=2576656|year=1989|last1=Shapiro|first1=F.|title=Eye movement desensitization: A new treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|volume=20|issue=3|pages=211–7|doi=10.1016/0005-7916(89)90025-6}}</ref>
