'''Stephen F. Blinkhorn''', [[CPsychol]], [[FBPsS]] (born 1949) is a British [[Occupational psychology|occupational psychologist]] and [[psychometrician]] (based in [[Hertfordshire]]), who continues to contribute to [[psychology]] and [[psychometric testing]].

Blinkhorn is known for publishing a number of papers, many of which have taken the form of book reviews for [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] magazine, including: 'Willow, Titwillow, Titwillow'<ref>Blinkhorn, S. 1994. 'Willow, titwillow, titwillow!' ''Nature'' '''372''' (1 Dec.): 417–419.</ref> (a review of [[Richard Herrnstein|Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Murray]]'s ''[[The Bell Curve]]''); 'What skulduggery?'<ref>Blinkhorn, S. 1982. ''Nature'' '''296''' (8 April): 506.</ref> (a review of [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s '[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'); and 'A gender bender'<ref>Blinkhorn, S. 2005. [http://www.prd.co.uk/Docbank/Nature/SexIQ.pdf 'A Gender Bender'] ''Nature'' '''438''' (3 Nov.): 31–32.</ref> (a critique on Paul Irwing and [[Richard Lynn]]'s paper on [[sex and intelligence]]). Other papers have argued about the inappropriate use of the [[Rasch model]],<ref>Goldstein H., and S. Blinkhorn. 1977. 'Monitoring Educational Standards: an inappropriate model' ''Bull. Br. Psychol. Soc.'' 30: 309–311.</ref> and the misuse of [[personality tests]].<ref>Blinkhorn, S., C. Johnson, and R. Wood. 1988. 'Spuriouser and spuriouser: The use of ipsative personality tests.'

==Life and career==
After attending grammar school, Blinkhorn attended [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

===Academia===
From 1973 to 1987, he developed and ran one of the first postgraduate studies in Occupational Psychology (in Britain) at what was then [[Hatfield Polytechnic]], now the [[University of Hertfordshire]]. During this time, he also spent a year as a visiting professor in the neurological laboratory at [[Stanford University]], California (1981–1982).

On his return from Stanford, Blinkhorn was approached by [[nferNelson]] ([[NFER]]'s publishing arm) to design new ranges of tests for occupational selection. This led to the formation of the Psychometric Research Unit at Hatfield, which in turn was privatised by Dr. Blinkhorn in 1985.

===Psychology and psychometrics===
Blinkhorn has been responsible for some of the most widely used ability and aptitude tests for recruitment and selection.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} He is also known as a critic of bad testing practice, in particular the abuse of [[personality tests]] (see papers). At the age of 37, he became one of the then youngest fellows of the [[British Psychological Society]]. He has been a member of the BPS's Test Standards Committee, and served on the Society's Fellowships Committee. He is one of three consulting editors for ''Selection & Development Review'' (SDR)<ref>''Selection & Development Review''. Vol 23. No.4, 2007. ISSN 0963-2638</ref> (published by the BPS) alongside Victor Dulewicz and Neil Anderson.

Blinkhorn was also a member of the panel formed by the BPS to investigate the [[polygraph]] and contributed a chapter to the book ''The Polygraph Test'' (1988), which resulted from the investigation.<ref>Blinkhorn, S. (1988) 'Lie Detection as a psychometric procedure' In Anthony Gale, ed. ''The Polygraph Test: Lies, Truth and Science''. London: Sage Publications, pp. 29–39.</ref>

As an expert witness, he has acted on behalf of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] in several industrial tribunals.<ref>
''Jootley et al. v British Railways Board'', which became known as the 'Paddington Guards' case.</ref><ref>''Amos et al. v London Underground Ltd.''</ref>

He has worked with Harvey Goldstein (on the inappropriate implementation of the [[Rasch model]] in education), and was involved with the development of [[National Vocational Qualification]]s.<ref>Wood, R., C. Johnson, S. Blinkhorn, and J. Hall. 1989. ''Boning, Blanching and Backtacking: Assessing Performance in the Workplace''. Research and Development Series 46. Sheffield: Training Agency</ref>

Blinkhorn also contributed a chapter in ''[[Cyril Burt]]: Fraud or Framed?''<ref>Mackintosh, N. J. (ed.) 1995. ''Cyril Burt: Fraud or Framed?''  Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 156.</ref><ref>Goodhart, C. B.

More recently followed by 'There's no-one quite like Grandad'<ref>[https://archive.is/20120903162036/http://www.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/354/354_05.html ''London Mathematical Society Newsetter''] 9 February 2007.</ref> (Blinkhorn's speech at the [[Lighthill institute of mathematical sciences]], Dec 2006) on newly rediscovered evidence which cast 'fresh light on early developments of mathematics applied to psychology' including references to [[Charles Spearman]]'s original work on general intelligence, and also to J.C. Maxwell Garnett, Cyril Burt, Godfrey Thomson, and [[Louis Thurstone]].

===''Nature'' articles===
Since 1980, Blinkhorn has been writing for ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', starting with a book review of [[Arthur Jensen]]'s ''Bias in Mental Testing''.<ref>Blinkhorn, Steve (1980) 'Most orthodox heresy: Jensen on IQ myths',Nature 286, 743 – 744 (14 Aug 1980) Book Review</ref> Steve Blinkhorn has written a number of articles, a few of which have been on controversial issues, such as: Gender and IQ ('Gender Bender'), Vitamin  Pills and IQ ('A dose of Vitamins and a Pinch of salt'),<ref>Blinkhorn, S. 1991.

In 2003, Blinkhorn was listed among ''Nature's'' 'magnificent seven' (writers commended for writing outstanding articles, illustrating 'the great job that scientists can do in communicating and commenting on new research' Others included David Wark, Philip N Benfey, S. Blair Hedges, John Harte, Toren Finzel and Len A.Fisk.<ref>''Nature''. 2003. 'News and Views' '''426''' (18 Dec.): 773-773.</ref>
