Simon wrote many books and articles, mostly on [[Economics|economic]] subjects. He is best known for his work on [[population]], [[natural resource]]s, and [[immigration]]. Simon is sometimes associated with [[cornucopian]] views, but he denied the label.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Simon |first1=Julian |title=The Ultimate Resource |date=1981 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=0-691-00369-6 |page=41}}</ref> Rather than focus on the abundance of nature, Simon focused lasting economic benefits from continuous [[population growth]], even despite limited or finite physical resources, empowered primarily by human ingenuity which would create substitutes, and [[History of technology|technological progress]].

He is also known for the famous [[Simon–Ehrlich wager]], a bet he made with ecologist [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]. Ehrlich bet that the prices for five metals would increase over a decade, while Simon took the opposite stance. Simon won the bet, as the prices for the metals sharply declined during that decade.

==Theory==
Simon's 1981 book ''[[The Ultimate Resource (book)|The Ultimate Resource]]'' is a criticism of what was then the [[conventional wisdom]] on [[Zero-sum thinking#Resource scarcity beliefs|resource scarcity]], published within the context of the cultural background created by the best-selling and highly influential book ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' in 1968 by Paul R. Ehrlich and ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' analysis published in 1972. ''The Ultimate Resource'' challenged the conventional wisdom on [[population growth]], raw-material scarcity and resource consumption. Simon argues that our notions of increasing resource-scarcity ignore the long-term declines in wage-adjusted raw material prices. Viewed economically, he argues, increasing wealth and technology make more resources available; although supplies may be limited physically they may be regarded as economically indefinite as old resources are recycled and new alternatives are assumed to be developed by the market. Simon challenged the notion of an impending [[Malthusian catastrophe]]—that an increase in population has negative economic consequences; that population is a drain on natural resources; and that we stand at risk of running out of resources through [[over-consumption]]. Simon argues that population is the solution to resource scarcities and environmental problems, since people and markets innovate. His ideas were praised by [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]] economists [[Friedrich Hayek]]<ref name="business.uiuc">{{cite web

Simon examined different raw materials, especially metals and their prices in historical times. He assumed that besides temporary shortfalls, in the long run prices for raw materials remain at similar levels or even decrease. E.g. [[Hall-Héroult process#Economic impact|aluminium]] was never as expensive as before 1886 and [[Steel#Historical|steel]] used for medieval armor carried a much higher price tag in current dollars than any modern parallel. A recent discussion of commodity index long-term trends supported his positions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Mark J.|title=Julian Simon: Still more right than lucky in 2013|url=http://www.aei-ideas.org/2013/01/julian-simon-still-more-right-than-lucky-in-2013/|publisher=American Enterprise Institute|access-date=24 January 2013}}</ref>

His 1984 book ''[[The Resourceful Earth]]'' (co-edited by [[Herman Kahn]]), is a similar criticism of the conventional wisdom on population growth and resource consumption and a direct response to the [[The Global 2000 Report to the President|Global 2000]] report. For example, it predicted that "There is no compelling reason to believe that world oil prices will rise in the coming decades. In fact, prices may well fall below current levels". Indeed, oil prices trended downward for nearly the next 2 decades, before rising above 1984 levels in about 2003 or 2004. Oil prices have subsequently risen and fallen, and risen again. In 2008, the price of crude oil reached $100 per barrel, a level last attained in the 1860s (inflation adjusted). Later in 2008, the price again sharply fell, to a low of about $40, before rising again to a high around $125. Since mid-2011, prices were slowly trending downward until the middle of 2014, but falling dramatically until the end of 2015 to ca. $30. Since then prices were relatively stable (below $50).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ycharts.com/indicators/brent_crude_oil_spot_price |title=Brent Crude Oil Spot Price |access-date=2016-07-17

Simon was [[Environmental skepticism|skeptical]], in 1994, of claims that human activity caused global environmental damage, notably in relation to [[CFCs]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[climate change]], the latter primarily because of the perceived rapid switch from fears of [[global cooling]] and a new [[ice age]] (in the mid-1970s) to the later fears of [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite web

Simon also listed numerous claims about alleged environmental damage and health dangers from pollution as "definitely disproved". These included claims about [[Lead poisoning|lead pollution]] & IQ, [[DDT]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[malathion]], [[Agent Orange]], [[asbestos]], and the chemical contamination at [[Love Canal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wVyDwYqq5fMC&pg=PA260 The Ultimate Resource 2], pp. 260–65</ref>  He dismissed such concerns as a mere "value judgement."

{{blockquote|But also, to a startling degree, the decision about whether the overall effect of a child or migrant is positive or negative depends on the values of whoever is making the judgment – your preference to spend a dollar now rather than to wait for a dollar-plus-something in twenty or thirty years, your preferences for having more or fewer wild animals alive as opposed to more or fewer human beings alive, and so on.<ref>{{cite web

Simon was also the first to suggest that [[airline]]s should provide incentives for travelers to give up their seats on [[overbooking|overbooked]] flights, rather than arbitrarily taking random passengers off the plane (a practice known as "bumping").<ref name="business.uiuc"/> Although the airline industry initially rejected it, his plan was later implemented with resounding success, as recounted by Milton Friedman in the foreword to ''The Ultimate Resource II''. Economist James Heins said in 2009 that the practice had added $100 billion to the United States economy in the last 30 years.<ref name="overbooking">{{cite news

Although not all of Simon's arguments were universally accepted, they contributed to a shift in opinion in the literature on [[demographic economics]] from a strongly Malthusian negative view of population growth to a more neutral view.{{nonspecific|date=December 2016}}{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} More recent theoretical developments, based on the ideas of the [[demographic dividend]] and [[demographic window]], have contributed to another shift,{{how|date=December 2016}} this time away from the debate viewing population growth as either good or bad.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Simon wrote a memoir, ''A Life Against the Grain'', which was published by his wife after his death.

==Wagers with rivals==

}}</ref> in 1980 over the [[price]] of [[metal]]s a [[decade]] later; Simon had been challenging environmental scientists to the bet for some time. Ehrlich, [[John Harte (physicist)|John Harte]], and [[John Holdren]] selected a basket of five metals that they thought would rise in price with increasing scarcity and depletion. Simon won the bet, with all five metals dropping in price.<ref name="simon award"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |year=2010 |location=Toronto |page=232}}</ref>

Supporters of Ehrlich's position suggest that much of this price drop came because of an [[Petroleum|oil]] spike driving prices up in 1980 and a [[recession]] driving prices down in 1990, pointing out that the price of the basket of metals actually rose from 1950 to 1975. They also suggest that Ehrlich did not consider the prices of these metals to be critical indicators, and that Ehrlich took the bet with great reluctance. On the other hand, Ehrlich selected the metals to be used himself, and at the time of the bet called it an "astonishing offer" that he was accepting "before other greedy people jump in."

The total supply in three of these metals (chromium, copper and nickel) increased during this time. Prices also declined for reasons specific to each of the five:
* The price of [[tin]] went down because of an increased use of [[aluminium]], a much more abundant, useful and inexpensive material.
* Better mining technologies allowed for the discovery of vast [[nickel]] [[lode]]s, which ended the near [[monopoly]] that was enjoyed on the market.
* [[Tungsten]] fell due to the rise of the use of [[ceramic]]s in [[cookware]].
* The price of [[chromium]] fell due to better smelting techniques.
* The price of [[copper]] began to fall due to the invention of [[fiber optic cable]] (which is derived from [[sand]]), which serves a number of the functions once reserved only for copper wire.

In all of these cases, better technology allowed for either more efficient use of existing resources, or substitution with a more abundant and less expensive resource, as Simon predicted.

===Paul R. Ehrlich – proposed second wager===
In 1995, Simon issued a challenge for a second bet. Ehrlich declined, and proposed instead that they bet on a metric for human [[quality of life|welfare]]. Ehrlich offered Simon a set of 15 metrics over 10 years, victor to be determined by scientists chosen by the president of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 2005. There was no meeting of minds, because Simon felt that too many of the metric's measured attributes of the world were not directly related to human welfare, e.g. the amount of [[nitrous oxide]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref><!--Does this source undermine the statement? --> For such indirect, supposedly bad indicators to be considered "bad", they would ultimately have to have some measurable detrimental effect on actual human welfare. Ehrlich refused to leave out measures considered by Simon to be immaterial.

Simon summarized the bet with the following analogy:

{{blockquote|Let me characterize their [Ehrlich and Schneider's] offer as follows. I predict, and this is for real, that the average performances in the next Olympics will be better than those in the last Olympics. On average, the performances have gotten better, Olympics to Olympics, for a variety of reasons. What Ehrlich and others say is that they don't want to bet on athletic performances, they want to bet on the conditions of the track, or the weather, or the officials, or any other such indirect measure.<ref>{{cite web

===David South===
The same year as his second challenge to Ehrlich, Simon also began a wager with David South, professor of the [[Auburn University]] School of Forestry. The Simon / South wager<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> concerned timber prices. Consistent with his cornucopian analysis of this issue in ''The Ultimate Resource'', Simon wagered that at the end of a five-year term the consumer price of pine timber would have decreased; South wagered that it would increase. Before five years had elapsed, Simon saw that market and extra-market forces were driving up the price of timber, and he paid Professor South $1,000.{{Citation needed|reason=in USD?|date=May 2008}} Simon died before the agreed-upon date of the end of the bet, by which time timber prices had risen further.

Simon's reasoning for his early exit out of the bet was due to "the far-reaching quantity and price effects of logging restrictions in the Pacific-northwest."<ref>{{cite web

 |url-status=dead
}}</ref> He believed this counted as interference from the U.S. government, which rendered the bet worthless according to his economic principles. Simon's bet only considered the possibility of prices being driven up by Alabama's government; he did not believe anything worthwhile was shown when U.S. logging restrictions drove the prices up.

== Main statements and criticism ==
[[Jared Diamond]] in his book [[Collapse (book)|''Collapse'']], [[Albert Allen Bartlett|Albert Bartlett]] and [[Garrett Hardin]] describe Simon as being too optimistic and some of his assumptions being not in line with natural limitations.

{{blockquote|We now have in our hands—really, in our libraries—the technology to feed, clothe, and supply energy to an ever-growing population for the next seven billion years. (Simon along ''The State of Humanity: Steadily Improving 1995''<ref>{{cite web

 |url-status=dead
}}</ref>) }}

Diamond claims that a continued stable growth rate of earth's population would result in extreme over-population long before the suggested time limit. Regarding the attributed population predictions Simon did not specify that he was assuming a fixed growth rate as Diamond, Bartlett and Hardin have done. Simon argued that people do not become poorer as the population expands; increasing numbers produce what they needed to support themselves, and have and will prosper while [[food prices]] sink.

{{blockquote|There is no reason to believe that at any given moment in the future the available quantity of any natural resource or service at present prices will be much smaller than it is now, or non-existent.|Simon in The Ultimate Resource, 1981}}

Diamond believes, and finds absurd, Simon implies it would be possible to produce metals, e.g. [[copper]], from other elements.<ref>Diamond bases his criticism upon the fact that the [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of elements on a large scale is not currently possible. In theory, transmutation could allow humans to one day produce copper from other elements, but this would require significant breakthroughs in knowledge and technology in order to overcome the enormous barriers currently preventing this (i.e. the extremely large amounts of energy required to generate extremely small quantities)</ref> For Simon, human resource needs are comparably small compared to the wealth of nature. He therefore argued physical limitations play a minor role and shortages of raw materials tend to be local and temporary. The main scarcity pointed out by Simon is the amount of human brain power (i.e. "The Ultimate Resource") which allows for the perpetuation of human activities for practically unlimited time. For example, before copper ore became scarce and prices soared due to global increasing demand for copper wires and cablings, the global data and telecommunication networks have switched to glass fiber backbone networks.

{{blockquote|This is my long-run forecast in brief, ... The material conditions of life will continue to get better for most people, in most countries, most of the time, indefinitely. Within a century or two, all nations and most of humanity will be at or above today's Western living standards. I also speculate, however, that many people will continue to think and say that the conditions of life are getting worse.<ref name=doomslayer />}}

This and other quotations in ''Wired'' are supposed to be the reason for [[Bjørn Lomborg]]'s ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''. Lomborg has stated that he began his research as an attempt to counter what he saw as Simons' anti-[[ecology|ecological]] arguments but changed his mind after starting to analyze the data.
