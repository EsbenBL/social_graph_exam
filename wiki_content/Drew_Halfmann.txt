==Career==
Drew Halfmann is currently Associate Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California, Davis]].<ref>[http://sociology.ucdavis.edu/people/halfmann UCD Department of Sociology. Accessed 10/13/13.]</ref><ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/cars.12005/asset/cars12005.pdf;jsessionid=129D22A70B0CC408D852308542A761D3.f03t02?v=1&t=hpnw1mvl&s=4c763a1e683718a6b2321fb9b8b78267922508e2 Pike, Robert M. "Book Review." 2013. ''CRS/RCS'' 50(1): 116-120. Accessed 12/26/13.]</ref>

His book ''Doctors and Demonstrators: How Political Institutions Shape Abortion Law in the United States, Britain, and Canada'' ([[University of Chicago Press]], 2011), which won the 2012 [[Charles Tilly Award for Best Book]] from the [[American Sociological Association]] section on Collective Behavior and Social Movements,<ref>[http://cbsm-asa.org/awards/ Collective Behavior and Social Movements Section of the American Sociological Association: List of Award Recipients. Accessed 10/14/13.]</ref> explains that [[abortion law]] remains contentious in the United States mainly due to permeability of [[political parties]] by [[social movements]].<ref>[http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo11757207.html University of Chicago Press: ''Doctors and Demonstrators''. Accessed 10/13/13.]</ref> This, Halfmann argues, is in contrast to abortion law in Britain and Canada, where the topic is a settled issue, experienced now in politics merely as a medical matter.<ref>[http://www.lpbr.net/2012/07/doctors-and-demonstrators-how-political.html Cox, Gloria. "Law and Politics Book Review: ''Doctors and Demonstrators.''" 2012. ''LPBR'' 22(7):339-343. Accessed 10/13/13.]</ref>

Halfmann’s work has appeared in ''[[The American Sociological Review]]'', ''[[Mobilization (journal)|Mobilization]]'', ''[[Social Problems]]'', ''[[Health (journal)|Health]]'', and other [[academic journals]].

Halfmann earned his doctorate at [[New York University]] in 2001. He spent his undergraduate years at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].
