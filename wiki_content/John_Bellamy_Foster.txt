'''John Bellamy Foster''' (born August 15, 1953) is an American [[professor]] of [[sociology]] at the [[University of Oregon]] and editor of the ''[[Monthly Review]]''. He writes about [[political economy]] of [[capitalism]] and [[economic crisis]], ecology and [[ecological crisis]], and [[Marxist theory]].<ref>[http://monthlyreview.org/2012/12/01/the-planetary-emergency ''The Planetary Emergency''] with Brett Clark, Monthly Review</ref> He has given numerous interviews, talks, and invited lectures, as well as written invited commentary, articles, and books on the subject.<ref>{{cite web|last=University of Oregon|author-link=University of Oregon|first=Department of Sociology|title=Faculty Homepage|url=http://sociology.uoregon.edu/faculty/foster.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427182349/http://sociology.uoregon.edu/faculty/foster.php|archive-date=2012-04-27}}</ref>

== Beginnings ==
Foster was active in the [[anti-war]] and environmental movements before enrolling at [[Evergreen State College]] in 1971. He studied [[economics]] in response to what he saw as an unfolding crisis in the [[capitalist]] economy and US involvement with the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]].

In 1976, he moved to [[Canada]] and entered the [[political science]] graduate program at [[York University]] in [[Toronto]]. He submitted his 1979 paper, ''The United States and Monopoly Capital: The Issue of Excess Capacity'', to [[Paul Sweezy]] of ''Monthly Review''. He also was published in journals such as ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics|The Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' and ''[[Science & Society]]'', and, in 1986, published ''The Theory of Monopoly Capitalism: An Elaboration of Marxian Political Economy'', based on his Ph.D. dissertation.<ref name=TheoryMonoCap />

Foster was hired in 1985 as a Visiting Member of the Faculty at The Evergreen State College. One year later he took a position as assistant professor of sociology at the [[University of Oregon]], and became a full professor of sociology in 2000. In 1989 he became a director of the Monthly Review Foundation Board and a member of the editorial committee of Monthly Review.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elwell|first=Frank, W., ed.|title=Macrosociology: The Study of Sociocultural Systems|year=2009|publisher=Edwin Mellen|location=Lewiston|pages=77–106, Chapter 3}}</ref>

==''Monthly Review''==
{{American socialism |expanded=Theorists}}
Foster published his first article for ''[[Monthly Review]]'', "Is Monopoly Capital an Illusion?", while in graduate school in 1981. He became a director of the Monthly Review Foundation Board and a member of the ''[[Monthly Review]]'' editorial committee in 1989. Along with [[Robert W. McChesney|Robert McChesney]], who had since their days at Evergreen College become a leading scholar of the political economy of the media, Foster joined [[Paul Sweezy]] and [[Harry Magdoff]] as a co-editor of ''[[Monthly Review]]'' in 2000. Two years later, he became president of the Monthly Review Foundation.

After Paul Sweezy's death in 2004, Robert McChesney's resignation as co-editor (while remaining on the board), and Harry Magdoff's death in 2006, Foster was left as sole editor of the magazine.

== Work ==
Foster's initial research centered on Marxian political economies and theories of capitalist development, with a focus on Paul Sweezy and [[Paul A. Baran|Paul Baran]]'s theory of monopoly. This was reflected in Foster's early book ''The Theory of Monopoly Capitalism'' and the coedited volume (with [[Henryk Szlajfer]]), ''The Faltering Economy: The Problem of Accumulation under Monopoly Capitalism''.<ref name=TheoryMonoCap>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|title=The Theory of Monopoly Capitalism|date=1986|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York}}</ref><ref name=Falteringeconomy>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|last2=Szlajfer|first2=Henryk|title=The Faltering Economy|url=https://archive.org/details/falteringeconomy00fost_0|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York}}</ref>

In the late 1980s, Foster turned toward issues of ecology. He focused on the relationship between the global environmental crisis and the crisis in the capitalist economy, while stressing the imperative for a sustainable, socialist alternative. During this period he published ''The Vulnerable Planet: A Short Economic History of the Environment''; his article "Marx's Theory of Metabolic Rift" in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''; and ''Marx's Ecology: Materialism and Nature''.<ref name=Vulnplanet>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|title=The Vulnerable Planet|date=1999|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York}}</ref><ref name=MarxAJS>{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|title=Marx's Theory of Metabolic Rift|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|date=1999|volume=105|issue=2|pages=366–405|doi=10.1086/210315|citeseerx=10.1.1.534.2551|s2cid=53608115}}</ref> His reinterpretation of Marx on ecology introduced the concept of "[[metabolic rift]]" and was widely influential. This work led to his receiving the Distinguished Contribution Award of the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Environment and Technology section. ''Marx's Ecology'' itself received the book award from the ASA's Section on Marxist Sociology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asanet.org/communities-sections/sections/current-sections/marxist-sociology/marxist-sociology-award-recipient-history|title=Marxist Sociology Award Recipient History|date=November 5, 2010|website=American Sociological Association}}</ref> This work was soon followed up by his book ''Ecology Against Capitalism'', which focused on the critique of [[capitalist]] economics from the standpoint of the environment.<ref name=Ecovscap>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|title=Ecology Against Capitalism|date=2002|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York}}</ref>

As editor of ''[[Monthly Review]]'', Foster returned to his earlier work on the [[political economy]] of [[capitalism]], but with a renewed focus on the role of U.S. [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign policy]] following September 2001. His 2006 book ''[[Naked Imperialism]]'', along with frequent editorials in the pages of ''[[Monthly Review]]'', attempted to account for the growing U.S. military role in the world and the shift toward a more visible, aggressive global projection.<ref name=nakedimp>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|title=[[Naked Imperialism]]|date=2006|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York}}</ref> Additionally, Foster has worked to expand [[Paul Sweezy|Sweezy]] and [[Paul A. Baran|Baran’s]] theory of [[Monopoly Capital|monopoly capital]] in light of the current [[Financial capital|financially led]] phase of capitalism, which he terms "monopoly-finance Capital." In this context he has written several books on the [[financialization]] of [[capitalism]] and [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].<ref name=GFC>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|last2=Magdoff|first2=Fred|title=The Great Financial Crisis|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781583671849|url-access=registration|date=2009|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York}}</ref><ref name=Endlesscrisis>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|last2=McChesney|first2=Robert|title=The Endless Crisis|date=2012|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York}}</ref>

''[[Critique of Intelligent Design]]'', Foster’s book co-authored with [[Brett Clark (sociologist)|Brett Clark]] and Richard York, is a continuation of his research on [[materialism|materialist philosophy]] and the relationship between ancient Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Drawing on his ecological work, particularly ''Marx’s Ecology'', Foster defends [[historical materialism]] as fundamental to a rational, [[science|scientific]] worldview, against proponents of [[Intelligent Design]] and other non-[[materialist]] [[ideologies]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|last2=Clark|first2=Brett|last3=York|first3=Richard|title=Critique of Intelligent Design|url=https://archive.org/details/critiqueofintell00fost|url-access=registration|date=2008|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York}}</ref>

Foster's book ''The Return of Nature: Socialism and Ecology'' (2020) won the [[Deutscher Memorial Prize]] for that year. In the book, 'Foster explores how socialist analysts and materialist scientists of various stamps, first in Britain, then the United States, from [[William Morris]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] to [[Joseph Needham]], [[Rachel Carson]], and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], sought to develop a dialectical naturalism, rooted in a critique of capitalism.'<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foster|first=John Bellamy|title=Monthly Review {{!}} The Return of Nature: Socialism and Ecology|url=https://monthlyreview.org/product/the-return-of-nature/|access-date=2020-11-14|website=Monthly Review|language=en-US}}</ref>
