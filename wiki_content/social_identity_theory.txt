===Historical background===
The term 'social identity theory' achieved academic currency only in the late 1970s, but the basic underlying concepts associated with it had emerged by the early twentieth century.  [[William G. Sumner]], writing in 1906, captures the primary dynamics in this excerpt from his influential work ''Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals'':

:"Loyalty to the group, sacrifice for it, hatred and contempt for outsiders, brotherhood within, warlikeness without,—all grow together, common products of the same situation. ... Men of an others-group are outsiders with whose ancestors the ancestors of the we-group waged war. ...  Each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exalts its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders. Each group thinks its own folkways the only right ones, and if it observes that other groups have other folkways, these excite its scorn."<ref>Sumner, W. G. ''Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals''. New York: Ginn, 1906. p. 13.</ref>

By the late 1920s the [[Collectivism|collectivist]] perspective had all but disappeared from mainstream [[social psychology]].<ref name="Hogg 81–97">{{cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A.|author2=Williams, Kipling D.|date=1 January 2000|title=From I to we: Social identity and the collective self|journal=Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice|volume=4|issue=1|pages=81–97|doi=10.1037/1089-2699.4.1.81}}</ref> Over fifty years later, around the time of the first formal use of the term 'social identity theory', Tajfel wrote this on the state of social psychology:

:"Thus, social categorization is still conceived as a haphazardly floating '[[independent variable]]' which strikes at random as the spirit moves it. No links are made or attempted, between the conditions determining its presence and mode of operation, and its outcomes in widely diffused commonalities of social behaviour. Why, when and how is social categorisation salient or not salient? What kind of shared constructions of social reality, mediated through social categorization, lead to a social climate in which large masses of people feel they are in long-term conflict with other masses? What, for example, are the ''psychological'' transitions from a stable to an unstable social system?" (Original emphasis, p. 188)<ref name="Tajfel (1979)">{{cite journal|last1=Tajfel|first1=H.|year=1979|title=Individuals and groups in social psychology|journal=British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=183–190|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8260.1979.tb00324.x}}</ref>

Thus, social identity theory in part reflects a desire to reestablish a more collectivist approach to social psychology of the self and social groups.<ref name="Hogg 81–97" />

==Aspects==
[[Image:4-14 Marines in Fallujah.jpg|thumb|Henri Tajfel suggests that soldiers of opposing armies, fighting outside of view, is an illustrative example of behaviour at the extreme intergroup end of the intergroup-interpersonal continuum.<ref name="Tajfel (1978)">{{cite journal | last1 = Tajfel | first1 = H. | editor-last = Tajfel | editor-first = H. | year = 1978 | title = Interindividual and intergroup behaviour | journal = Differentiation Between Groups: Studies in the Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations | pages = 27–60 | location = London | publisher = Academic Press}}</ref>]]

===The interpersonal-intergroup continuum===
Social identity theory states that social behavior will want a person to change his/her behavior while in a group. It varies along a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] between [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] behavior and intergroup behaviour. Completely interpersonal behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the individual characteristics and interpersonal relationships that exists between only two people. Completely intergroup behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the social category memberships that apply to more than two people.<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)."/> The authors of social identity theory state that purely interpersonal or purely intergroup behaviour is unlikely to be found in realistic social situations. Rather, behaviour is expected to be driven by a compromise between the two extremes.<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)." /><ref name="Tajfel (1978)" /> The [[Cognition|cognitive]] nature of personal vs. social identities, and the relationship between them, is more fully developed in self-categorization theory.<ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2010)." /><ref name="Oakes et al.

===Positive distinctiveness===
A key assumption in social identity theory is that individuals are intrinsically [[motivation|motivated]] to achieve positive distinctiveness. That is, individuals "strive for a positive self-concept".<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)."/><ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/> As individuals to varying degrees may be defined and informed by their respective social identities (as per the interpersonal-intergroup continuum) it is further derived in social identity theory that "individuals strive to achieve or to maintain positive social identity".<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)."/> The precise nature of this strive for positive self-concept is a matter of debate (see [[Social identity theory#Self-esteem hypothesis|the self-esteem hypothesis]]).<ref name="Turner (1999)"/><ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2001)"/><ref name="Long & Spears (1997)"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | last3 = Jetten | first3 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Low status groups show in-group favoritism to compensate for their low status and to compete for higher status | url = http://psyarxiv.com/p73mf/| journal = Group Processes and Intergroup Relations | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 563–576 | doi = 10.1177/1368430213514122 }}</ref> Both the interpersonal-intergroup continuum and the assumption of positive distinctiveness motivation arose as outcomes of the findings of [[minimal group paradigm|minimal group studies]].<ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2010)." /> In particular, it was found that under certain conditions individuals would endorse resource distributions that would maximize the positive distinctiveness of an ingroup in contrast to an outgroup at the expense of personal self-interest.<ref name="Turner (1978)">{{cite journal |last1= Turner|first1= J.

===Positive distinctiveness strategies===
Building on the above components, social identity theory details a variety of strategies that may be invoked in order to achieve positive distinctiveness. The individual's choice of behaviour is posited to be dictated largely by the perceived intergroup relationship. In particular the choice of strategy is an outcome of the perceived permeability of group boundaries (e.g., whether a group member may pass from a low status group into a high status group), as well as the perceived stability and legitimacy of the intergroup status hierarchy.<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)."/><ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/> The self-enhancing strategies detailed in social identity theory are detailed below. Importantly, although these are viewed from the perspective of a low status group member, comparable behaviours may also be adopted by high status group members.<ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/>

====Individual mobility====
It is predicted that under conditions where the group boundaries are considered permeable individuals are more likely to engage in [[Social mobility|individual mobility]] strategies.<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)."/><ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/> That is, individuals "disassociate from the group and pursue individual goals designed to improve their personal lot rather than that of their ingroup".<ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p. 38.">Haslam, A. S. (2001). Psychology in Organizations. London, SAGE Publications. p. 38</ref>

====Social creativity====
Where group boundaries are considered impermeable, and where status relations are considered reasonably stable, individuals are predicted to engage in social creativity behaviours. Here, low-status ingroup members are still able to increase their positive distinctiveness without necessarily changing the objective resources of the ingroup or the outgroup. This may be achieved by comparing the ingroup to the outgroup on some new dimension, changing the values assigned to the attributes of the group, and choosing an alternative outgroup by which to compare the ingroup.<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)."/><ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/>

====Social competition====
Here an ingroup seeks positive distinctiveness and requires positive differentiation via direct competition with the outgroup in the form of [[Social identity theory#Ingroup favoritism|ingroup favoritism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tajfel|first=Henri|last2=Billig|first2=M. G.|last3=Bundy|first3=R.

S. (2001). p 26-57"/> Although not privileged in the theory, it is this positive distinctiveness strategy that has received the greatest amount of attention.<ref name="Ouwerkerk et al.

==Implications==
===Ingroup favoritism===
{{Main|In-group favoritism}}
In-group favoritism (also known as "ingroup bias", despite Turner's objections to the term<ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2001)"/>) is an effect where people give preferential treatment to others when they are perceived to be in the same ingroup. Social identity attributes the cause of ingroup favoritism to a psychological need for positive distinctiveness and describes the situations where ingroup favoritism is likely to occur (as a function of perceived group status, legitimacy, stability, and permeability).<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)."/><ref name="Ellemers & Barreto (2001)">{{cite book | last1 = Ellemers | first1 = N. | last2 = Barreto | first2 = M. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = S.

System justification theory was originally proposed by John Jost and Mahzarin Banaji in 1994 to build on social identity theory and to understand important deviations from ingroup favoritism, such as outgroup favoritism on the part of members of disadvantaged groups (Jost & Banaji, 1994; Jost, 2020).

===Prosocial Behaviors===
Social identification can lead individuals to engage in prosocial behaviors towards others.<ref name="Hackel, Zaki, and Bavel, (2017)">{{cite journal|last1=Hackel|last2=Zaki|last3=Bavel.|year = 2017| title=Social identity shapes social valuation: evidence from prosocial behavior and vicarious reward |journal= Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci|volume=12|issue=8|pages=1219–1228|doi=10.1093/scan/nsx045|pmid=28402506|pmc=5597888}}</ref> Examples include contexts such as food drives <ref name="Shipley, (2008)">{{cite journal|last1=Shipley|year = 2008| title=Social Comparison and prosocial behavior: An applied study of social identity theory in community food drives|journal= Psychological Reports|volume = 102|issue = 2|pages = 425–434|doi=10.2466/pr0.102.2.425-434|pmid = 18567213}}</ref> or even shared purchasing patterns, as might occur for motorcycle riders.<ref name="Johnson et al, (2013)">{{cite journal|last1=Johnson |last2=Massiah | last3=Allen |year = 2013| title=Community identification increases consumer-to-consumer helping, but not always|journal= Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=121–129 |doi=10.1108/07363761311304933}}</ref> Interestingly, consumers may have sub-identities that are nested into a larger identity.  As a result, "[w]hen consumers identify with the overall community, they assist other consumers. However, consumers are less likely to help consumers in the overall community when identifying with a subgroup".<ref name="Johnson et al, (2013)" />

=== Reluctance to bet against identity-relevant outcomes ===
Social identities are a valued aspect of the self, and people will sacrifice their pecuniary self-interest to maintain the self-perception that they belong to a given social group. Political partisans and fans of sports teams (e.g., Republicans and Democrats, or MLB, NFL, NCAA fans) are reluctant to bet against the success of their party or team because of the diagnostic cost such a bet would incur to their identification with it. As a result, partisans and fans will reject even very favorable bets against identity-relevant desired outcomes. More than 45% of N.C.A.A. basketball and hockey fans, for example, turned down a free, real chance to earn $5 if their team lost its upcoming game.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|last2=Tang|first2=Simone|last3=Larrick|first3=Richard P.|date=2016-10-12|title=Betting Your Favorite to Win: Costly Reluctance to Hedge Desired Outcomes|journal=Management Science|volume=64|issue=3|pages=997–1014|doi=10.1287/mnsc.2016.2656|issn=0025-1909}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Self-esteem hypothesis===
Social identity theory proposes that people are motivated to achieve and maintain positive concepts of themselves. Some researchers, including [[Michael Hogg]] and [[Dominic Abrams]], thus propose a fairly direct relationship between positive social identity and [[self-esteem]]. In what has become known as the "self-esteem hypothesis", self-esteem is predicted to relate to in-group bias in two ways. Firstly, successful intergroup discrimination elevates self-esteem. Secondly, depressed or threatened self-esteem promotes intergroup discrimination.<ref name="Hogg & Abrams (1990)">{{cite journal | last1 = Hogg | first1 = M.

Some social identity theorists, including John Turner, consider the self-esteem hypothesis as not canonical to social identity theory.<ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2001)"/><ref name="Long & Spears (1997)"/> In fact, the self-esteem hypothesis is argued to be conflictual with the tenets of the theory.<ref name="Turner (1999)"/><ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2001)"/><ref name="Turner & Oakes, (1997)">{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = P. J. | editor1-last = McGarty | editor1-first = C. | editor2-last = Haslam | editor2-first = S. A. | year = 1997  | title = The socially structured mind | journal = The Message of Social Psychology | pages = 355–373 | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Blackwell }}</ref> It is argued that the self-esteem hypothesis misunderstands the distinction between a social identity and a personal identity. Along those lines, John Turner and [[Penny Oakes]] argue against an interpretation of positive distinctiveness as a straightforward need for self-esteem or "quasi-biological drive toward prejudice".<ref name="Turner & Oakes, (1997)"/> They instead favour a somewhat more complex conception of positive self-concept as a reflection of the ideologies and social values of the perceiver. Additionally, it is argued that the self-esteem hypothesis neglects the alternative strategies to maintaining a positive self-concept that are articulated in social identity theory (i.e., individual mobility and social creativity).<ref name="Turner (1999)"/><ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2001)"/><ref name="Ellemers & Barreto (2001)"/>

===Positive-negative asymmetry===
In what has been dubbed the Positive-Negative Asymmetry Phenomenon, researchers have shown that punishing the out-group benefits self-esteem less than rewarding the in-group.<ref name="Bourhis & Gagnon (2001)">{{cite book | last1 = Bourhis | first1 = R. Y. | last2 = Gagnon | first2 = A. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = S. L. | editor2-last = Gaertner | year = 2001 | chapter = Social Orientations in the Minimal Group Paradigm | title = Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup Processes | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 133–152}}</ref> From this finding it has been extrapolated that social identity theory is therefore unable to deal with bias on negative dimensions. Social identity theorists, however, point out that for ingroup favouritism to occur a social identity "must be psychologically salient", and that negative dimensions may be experienced as a "less fitting basis for self-definition".<ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2010). p142">Turner, J. C. & Reynolds, K. J. (2010). The story of social identity. In T. Postmes & N. Branscombe (Eds). Rediscovering Social Identity: Core Sources. Psychology Press. p. 142</ref> This important qualification is subtly present in social identity theory, but is further developed in self-categorization theory. Empirical support for this perspective exist. It has been shown that when experiment participants can self-select negative dimensions that define the ingroup no positive–negative asymmetry is found.<ref name="Reynolds et al. (2000)">{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Turner | first2 = J. C. |  last3 = Haslam | first3 = S. A. | last4 = Ryan | first4 = M.

===Intergroup similarity===
It has been posited that social identity theory suggests that similar groups should have an increased motivation to differentiate themselves from each other.<ref name="brown2000"/><ref name="Brown (1984)">{{cite book | last1 = Brown | first1 = R. J. | editor-last = Tajfel | editor-first = H. | year = 1984 | title = The role of similarity in intergroup relations | journal = The Social Dimension | volume = 2 | pages = 603–623 | location = Cambridge | publisher = University Press | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511759154.012 | isbn = 9780511759154}}</ref> Subsequently, empirical findings where similar groups are shown to possess increased levels of intergroup attraction and decreased levels of in-group bias have been interpreted as problematic for the theory.<ref name="brown2000"/> Elsewhere it has been suggested that this apparent inconsistency may be resolved by attending to social identity theory's emphasis on the importance of the perceived stability and legitimacy of the intergroup status hierarchy.<ref name="Brown (1984)"/>

===Predictive power===
Social identity theory has been criticised for having far greater [[explanatory power]] than [[predictive power]].<ref name="Miller (1983)"/><ref name="Hogg 81–97"/><ref name="Duckitt (1992)">{{cite book|last=Duckitt|first=John|title=The social psychology of prejudice|year=1992|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=London|pages=84–90|chapter=5}}</ref>  That is, while the relationship between independent variables and the resulting intergroup behaviour may be consistent with the theory in retrospect, that particular outcome is often not that which was predicted at the outset. A rebuttal to this charge is that the theory was never advertised as the definitive answer to understanding intergroup relationships. Instead it is stated that social identity theory must go hand in hand with sufficient understanding of the specific social context under consideration.<ref name="Turner (1999)"/><ref name="Turner & Reynolds (2001)"/><ref name="Tajfel (1984)">{{cite book | last1 = Tajfel | first1 = H. | editor-last = Tajfel | editor-first = H. | year = 1984 | title = Intergroup relations, social myths and social justice in social psychology | journal = The Social Dimension | volume = 2 | pages = 695–715 | location = Cambridge | publisher = University Press | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511759154.016 | isbn = 9780511759154}}</ref> The latter argument is consistent with the explicit importance that the authors of social identity theory placed on the role of "objective" factors, stating that in any particular situation "the effects of [social identity theory] variables are powerfully determined by the previous social, economic, and political processes".<ref name="Tajfel & Turner (1979)."/>

===SIT-lite===
Some researchers interpret social identity theory as drawing a direct link between identification with a social group and ingroup favoritism.<ref name="Stangor & Jost (1997)">{{cite journal|last1=Stangor|first1=C.|last2=Jost|first2=J.

For example, [[Charles Stangor]] and [[John Jost]] state that "a main premise of social identity theory is that ingroup members will favour their own group over other groups".<ref name="Stangor & Jost (1997). p346">{{cite journal|last1=Stangor|first1=C.|last2=Jost|first2=J.

London, SAGE Publications. p. 40</ref> The likening of social identity theory with social competition and ingroup favouritism is partly attributable to the fact that early statements of the theory included empirical examples of ingroup favouritism, while alternative positive distinctiveness strategies (e.g., social creativity) were at that stage theoretical assertions.<ref name="Haslam et al., (2010a)."/> Regardless, in some circles the prediction of a straightforward identification-bias correlation has earned the pejorative title "social identity theory-lite".<ref name="McGarty, C. (2001)"/> This raises the problem of whether social identity theory really does explain the ubiquity of ingroup favoritism in the minimal group paradigm without making recourse to "the generic norm hypothesis" originally proposed by Tajfel but later abandoned.{{Fact|date=March 2021}}
