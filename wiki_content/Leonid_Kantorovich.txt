'''Leonid Vitaliyevich Kantorovich''' ({{lang-rus|Леони́д Вита́льевич Канторо́вич||p=lʲɪɐˈnʲit vʲɪˈtalʲjɪvʲɪtɕ kəntɐˈrovʲɪtɕ|a=Ru-Leonid_Vitaliyevich_Kantorovich.ogg}}; 19 January 1912{{spaced ndash}}7 April 1986) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[mathematician]] and [[economist]], known for his theory and development of techniques for the optimal allocation of resources. He is regarded as the founder of [[linear programming]]. He was the winner of the [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1949 and the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1975.

== Biography ==
Kantorovich was born on 19 January 1912, to a [[Russian Jewish]] family.<ref>''The Soviet Union: empire, nation, and system'', By Aron Kat︠s︡enelinboĭgen, page 406, Transaction Publishers, 1990</ref> His father was a doctor practicing in [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Gass | first1 = Saul I. | last2 = Rosenhead | first2 = J. | chapter = Leonid Vital’evich Kantorovich | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4419-6281-2_10 | title = Profiles in Operations Research | series = International Series in Operations Research & Management Science | volume = 147 | pages = 157 | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4419-6280-5 }}</ref> In 1926, at the age of fourteen, he began his studies at the [[Leningrad University]]. He graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics in 1930, and began his graduate studies. In 1934, at the age of 22 years, he became a full professor.

Later, Kantorovich worked for the [[Soviet government]]. He was given the task of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimizing]] production in a [[plywood]] industry. He devised the mathematical technique now known as [[linear programming]] in 1939, some years before it was advanced by [[George Dantzig]]. He authored several books including ''The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization'' (Russian original 1939), ''The Best Uses of Economic Resources'' (Russian original 1959), and, with Vladimir Ivanovich Krylov, ''Approximate methods of higher analysis'' (Russian original 1936).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Approximate methods of higher analysis'' by L. V. Kantorovich and V. I. Krylov|author=Kaplan, W.|author-link=Wilfred Kaplan|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|volume=66|year=1960|pages=146–147|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1960-10408-9|issue=3|doi-access=free}}</ref> For his work, Kantorovich was awarded the [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1949.

After 1939, he became the professor of [[Military Engineering-Technical University]]. During the [[Siege of Leningrad]], Kantorovich was the professor of [[Military Engineering-Technical University|VITU of Navy]] and in charge of safety on the [[Road of Life]]. He calculated the optimal distance between cars on ice, depending on thickness of ice and temperature of the air. In December 1941 and January 1942, Kantorovich personally walked between cars driving on the ice of Lake Ladoga, on the [[Road of Life]], to ensure the cars did not sink. However, many cars with food for survivors of the siege were destroyed by the [[Germans|German]] airstrikes. In 1948 Kantorovich was assigned to the atomic project of the USSR. For his feat and courage Kantorovich was awarded the [[Order of the Patriotic War]], and was decorated with the medal ''For Defense of Leningrad''. 

After 1960, Kantorovich lived and worked in [[Novosibirsk]], where he created and took charge of the Department of Computational Mathematics in [[Novosibirsk State University]].<ref>[http://www.nsu.ru/xmlui/bitstream/handle/nsu/2145/01.pdf Kantorovich`s biography in Russian]</ref>

The [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Memorial Prize]], which he shared with [[Tjalling Koopmans]], was given "for their contributions to the theory of optimum allocation of resources."

==Mathematics==
In [[mathematical analysis]], Kantorovich had important results in [[functional analysis]], [[approximation theory]], and [[operator theory]].

In particular, Kantorovich formulated fundamental results in the theory of [[Normed vector space|normed]] [[Riesz space|vector lattices]], which are called "K-spaces" in his honor.

Kantorovich showed that [[functional analysis]] could be used in the analysis of [[iterative method]]s, obtaining the [[Kantorovich inequality|Kantorovich inequalities]] on the [[Rate of convergence|convergence rate]] of the [[gradient method]] and of [[Newton's method]] (see the [[Kantorovich theorem]]).

Kantorovich considered [[infinite-dimensional optimization]] problems, such as the Kantorovich-Monge problem in [[Transportation theory (mathematics)|transportation theory]]. His analysis proposed the [[Kantorovich metric]], which is used in [[probability theory]], in the theory of the [[Weak convergence of measures#Weak convergence of measures|weak convergence]] of [[probability measure]]s.
