In 1987, when Muslim youths were killed under police custody, Swamy spoke against it and sat on a fast for more than a week in Jantar Mantar demanding the institution of an inquiry.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/item/51993-why-is-bjp-always-doing-congress-a-favour?.html |title=Why is BJP always doing Congress a favour? |periodical=[[The Pioneer (Indian newspaper)|Daily Pioneer]] |date=14 July 2012 |author=Shahroze Tariq Raza |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716233544/http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/item/51993-why-is-bjp-always-doing-congress-a-favour?.html |archive-date=16 July 2012}}</ref> After 25 years he started pursuing the case once again in court.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2012/07/10/subramanian-swamy-gets-weapon-against-chidambaram-riot-1032579.html |title=Subramanian Swamy gets brahmastra against Chidambaram |periodical=[[Oneindia.in|News One India]] |date=10 July 2012}}</ref>

On 15 April 2011, he filed a 206-page petition with PM Singh seeking permission to prosecute [[Sonia Gandhi]] on charges of corruption. He also raised doubts regarding her acquisition of Indian citizenship.<ref>{{citation |url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/article383222.ece |work=The New Indian Express |title=Permit me to prosecute Sonia: Swamy |date=19 April 2011 |access-date=1 August 2011}}</ref> Swamy filed documents in the court to prosecute [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] [[P.

====Sanction to prosecute telecom minister A. Raja====
On 31 January 2012, the [[Supreme Court of India]] accepted Swamy's petition against the [[Prime Minister's Office (India)|Prime Minister's Office]] in the 2G case, saying that all public authorities should give a sanction within three months against any public official if a request is made for prosecution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/2g-case-sc-allows-swamys-petition-on-grant-of-sanction/articleshow/11696767.cms|title=2G case: SC allows Swamy's petition on grant of sanction|date=2012-01-31|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>

The Supreme Court said that Swamy had the [[locus standi]] to seek sanction from the Prime Minister for the prosecution of A. Raja in the 2G case. Sanction by a competent authority for the prosecution of a public servant has to be granted within a time frame, the apex court said. Justice [[AK Ganguly]] said that the sanction would be deemed to be granted if competent authority failed to take a decision within four months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Prosecuting-corrupt-officials-SC-sets-deadline-for-govt/articleshow/11696857.cms|title=Prosecuting corrupt officials: SC sets deadline for govt {{!}} India News - Times of India|last1=Jan 31|first1=PTI {{!}} Updated|last2=2012|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2020-01-01|last3=Ist|first3=12:08}}</ref>

Swamy's arguments were that he wrote to the PMO on 29 November 2008, but it was only on 19 March 2010 the PMO replied that the plea made by Swamy was "premature" as investigation was being carried out by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI).Raja was arrested by the CBI in the case and got bail on 15 May 2012 after spending nearly 15 months in the [[Tihar Jail|Tihar Central Jail]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3421102.ece |location=Chennai |work=The Hindu |title=Raja gets bail, walks out of Tihar jail |date=15 May 2012}}</ref>

=== Petition to strike down "single directive provision" ===
In 1997, Swamy filed a petition in the [[Supreme Court of India]] to strike down a provision which barred [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] from investigating corruption charges against officers of the rank of joint secretary and above without prior permission of the [[Government of India]] called as ''"Dr. Subramanian Swamy Versus Director, Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr."''<ref name="With govt's single directive, law no longer above all">{{cite news |title=With govt's single directive, law no longer above all |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/With-govts-single-directive-law-no-longer-above-all/articleshow/1019946.cms |access-date=6 May 2014}}</ref> on 6 May 2014, a five-judge [[Constitution Bench (India)|constitution bench]] held the single directive provision as invalid and unconstitutional.

===Investigation on EVM===
{{further|Indian voting machines}}

Swamy demanded that an independent committee should be formed to check the security and safety of the [[Indian voting machines|Electronic Voting Machines]] (EVM) to avoid any rigging or tampering. He demanded that a printed receipt should be given to every voter after casting the vote.<ref>{{cite news |author=Special Correspondent |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/swamy-for-expert-panel-on-secure-evms/article106271.ece |title=Swamy for expert panel on secure EVMs |location=CHENNAI |work=The Hindu |date=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/evms-not-tamperfree/article712729.ece |title=EVMs not tamper-free |work=The Hindu |date=18 February 2010}}</ref> His [[Public-interest litigation (India)|PIL]] to investigate the working of EVM was dismissed by the [[Delhi High Court]] on 17 January 2012. The court refused to give any direction to the [[Election Commission of India|Election Commission]] to bring back paper-ballot system or use of printed receipts. The Commission argued that the use of paper is not feasible due to the huge size of Indian electorate. The court further asked the Election Commission to "immediately begin a process of wider consultations" and the Parliament "to go into this question in depth and decide".<ref>{{cite web |author=Anita |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2012/01/17/delhi-hc-says-not-impossible-to-tamper-evm-s.html |title=Delhi High Court says not impossible to tamper EVMs |work=OneIndia |date=17 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/delhi-hc-rejects-swamys-plea-to-bring-back-paper-ballots/900646 |title=Delhi HC rejects Swamy's plea to bring back paper ballots |work=The Indian Express |date=17 January 2012}}</ref>

==== Israel ====
In various speeches and articles, Swamy has expressed his admiration for, and solidarity with, the [[State of Israel]] and has credited its retaliatory capacity for its ability to survive as a nation in a hostile Arab environment. Swamy made pioneering efforts towards India's establishment of [[India–Israel relations|diplomatic relations with Israel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-israel-visas-from-india-were-issued-from-this-mps-residence/articleshow/59438603.cms |title=First Israel visas in India were issued from this MP's residence}}</ref> in 1982, Swamy became the first Indian political leader to make a well-publicised trip to Israel, where he met with several important Israeli leaders such as [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and then-Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]].

==== United States ====
Swamy is a strong supporter of U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], endorsing Trump's presidential candidacy in 2016 and comparing Trump to himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/modi-s-bet-on-trump-of-india-signals-risks-to-his-reform-push |title=Modi's Bet on 'Trump of India' Signals Risks to Reform Push |work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] |date=24 May 2016}}</ref>

After the [[Unite the Right rally|Charlottesville riots]] in August 2017, he posted a tweet urging Indians residing in the United States to "stand with Trump at this hour of his being hunted by cockeyed liberals & Left wing loonies on racism" and praised Trump for "having showed the hypocrites their place by telling it like it is."<ref>https://www.thequint.com/neon/social-buzz/subramanian-swamy-trolled-on-twitter</ref>

Following criticism of Pakistan by Trump, Swamy called for closer relations between India and the United States.<ref>http://www.freepressjournal.in/india/after-us-president-trumps-anti-pak-tweet-subramanian-swamy-calls-for-stronger-india-us-relations/1197599</ref>

===Domestic policy===
==== LGBT rights ====
In 2018, when the Indian Supreme Court decriminalised gay sexual acts, Swamy criticised the ruling, saying "It could give rise to an increase in the number of HIV cases."<ref>{{Cite web|title='It Will Give Rise to HIV Cases': Subramanian Swamy Frowns at SC Verdict on Section 377|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/it-will-give-rise-to-hiv-cases-gay-bars-bjps-subramanian-swamy-frowns-at-sc-verdict-on-sec-377-1869533.html|date=2018-09-06|website=News18|access-date=2020-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2018-09-06|title=Joy in India as gay sex becomes legal|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45404904|access-date=2020-05-16}}</ref>

==== Kashmir ====
In September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of "peacefully" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,

:"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. for our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]

:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, [[Hari Singh]], on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1345324.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kashmir defines Indian identity |date=25 September 2008}}</ref>
