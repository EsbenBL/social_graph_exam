==Biography==
===Early life===
Rubin was raised in a middle-class Jewish home in then-segregated [[South Carolina]]. She attended segregated public schools, her classes only being desegregated when she was a senior. Rubin has written that her experiences growing up in the segregated South has given her "an abiding hatred of racism in all its forms and a healthy respect for its tenacity." As one of the few Jews in her Southern city, she resented the dominance of white Protestants over African-Americans, Catholics, and Jews. The only Jewish child in her elementary school, she claims she was punished for refusing to recite the [[Lord's Prayer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubin |first=Gayle S. |date=2011 |title=Deviations: A Gayle Rubin Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMlJ-REYViwC&q=Deviations:+A+Gayle+Rubin+Reader |location=Durham & London |publisher=Duke University Press |page=2 |isbn=9780822349716 }}</ref>

===College, early activism, and early writing===
In 1968 Rubin was part of an early feminist [[consciousness raising]] group active on the campus of the University of Michigan and also wrote on [[feminist]] topics for [[women's movement]] papers and the ''[[Ann Arbor Argus]]''.<ref name="Feminists 1963-75">{{cite book|last=Love|first=Barbara J.|title=Feminists Who Changed America: 1963‚Äì1975|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252031892|page=[https://archive.org/details/feministswhochan00love/page/398 398]|url=https://archive.org/details/feministswhochan00love|url-access=registration|quote=feminists who changed.}}</ref>  In 1970 she helped found Ann Arbor ''[[Radicalesbians]]'', an early [[lesbian feminist]] group.<ref name="Feminists 1963-75"/>

===San Francisco===
In 1978 Rubin moved to [[San Francisco]] to begin studies of the gay male [[leather subculture]], seeking to examine a minority sexual practice neither from a clinical perspective nor through the lens of individual psychology but rather as an [[anthropologist]] studying a contemporary community.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|author2=Judith Butler|title=Sexual Traffic|journal=Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies|year=1994|volume=6|issue=2|page=91|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~decaste/OISE/page2/files/RubinButler.pdf|access-date=1 April 2018}}</ref>

Rubin was a member of Cardea, a women's discussion group within a San Francisco [[BDSM]] organization called the [[Society of Janus]]; Cardea existed from 1977 to 1978 before discontinuing. A core of lesbian members of Cardea, including Rubin, [[Patrick Califia|Pat Califia]] (who identified as a lesbian at the time), and sixteen others, were inspired to start [[Samois]] on June 13, 1978, as an exclusively lesbian BDSM group.<ref>[http://www.hawkeegn.com/bdsm/janhis.pdf Society of Janus: 25 Years, 1999, copyright T.

==Thought==

==="The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex"<ref name="genderstudiesgroupdu.files.wordpress.com"/>===
In this essay, Rubin devised the phrase "sex/gender system", which she defines as "the set of arrangements by which a society transforms biological sexuality into products of human activity, and in which these transformed sexual needs are satisfied." She takes as a starting point writers who have previously discussed gender and sexual relations as an economic institution ([[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]) which serves a conventional social function ([[Claude L√©vi-Strauss]]) and is reproduced in the psychology of children ([[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]). She argues that these writers fail to adequately explain women's oppression, and offers a reinterpretation of their ideas. Rubin addresses [[Marxist]] thought by identifying women's role within a capitalist society.<ref name="Rubin, Gayle 2004">Rubin, Gayle. "The Traffic in Women". ''Literary Theory: An Anthology''. Ed. Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan. 2nd ed. Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2004. 770‚Äì794.</ref> She argues that the reproduction of labor power depends upon women's housework to transform commodities into sustenance for the worker. The system of capitalism cannot generate surplus without women, yet society does not grant women access to the resulting capital.

Rubin argues that historical patterns of female oppression have constructed this role for women in capitalist societies. She attempts to analyze these historical patterns by considering the sex/gender system. According to Rubin, "Gender is a socially imposed division of the sexes."<ref name="Rubin, Gayle 2004"/> She cites the exchange of women within [[Patriarchy|patriarchal societies]] as perpetuating the pattern of female oppression, referencing Marcel Mauss' ''Essay on the Gift''<ref>Mauss, Marcel, and W. D. Halls. ''The Gift: the Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2000. Print.</ref> and using his idea of the "gift" to establish the notion that gender is created within this exchange of women by men in a [[kinship]] system. Women are born biologically female, but only become gendered when the distinction between male giver and female gift is made within this exchange. For men, giving the gift of a daughter or a sister to another man for the purpose of matrimony allows for the formation of kinship ties between two men and the transfer of "sexual access, genealogical statuses, lineage names and ancestors, rights and people"<ref name="Rubin, Gayle 2004"/> to occur. When using a Marxist analysis of capitalism within this sex/gender system, the exclusion of women from the system of exchange establishes men as the capitalists and women as their commodities fit for exchange. She ultimately hopes for an "androgynous and genderless" society in which sexual difference has no socially constructed and hierarchical meaning.<ref name="Rubin, Gayle 2004"/>

==="Thinking Sex"===
In her 1984 essay "Thinking Sex", Rubin interrogated the value system that social groups‚Äîwhether left- or right-wing, feminist or patriarchal‚Äîattribute to sexuality  which defines some behaviours as good/natural and others (such as [[pedophilia]]) as bad/unnatural.  In this essay she introduced the idea of the "Charmed Circle" of sexuality, that sexuality that was privileged by society was inside of it, while all other sexuality was outside of, and in opposition to it. The binaries of this "charmed circle" include couple/alone or in groups, monogamous/promiscuous, same generation/cross-generational, and bodies only/with manufactured objects. The "Charmed Circle" speaks to the idea that there is a hierarchical valuation of sex acts. In this essay, Rubin also discusses a number of ideological formations that permeate sexual views. The most important is sex negativity, in which Western cultures consider sex to be a dangerous, destructive force. If marriage, reproduction, or love are not involved, almost all sexual behavior is considered bad. Related to sex negativity is the fallacy of the misplaced scale. Rubin explains how sex acts are troubled by an excess of significance.

Rubin's discussion of all of these models assumes a domino theory of sexual peril. People feel a need to draw a line between good and bad sex as they see it standing between sexual order and chaos. There is a fear that if certain aspects of "bad" sex are allowed to move across the line, unspeakable acts will move across as well. One of the most prevalent ideas about sex is that there is one proper way to do it. Society lacks a concept of benign sexual variation. People fail to recognize that just because they do not like to do something does not make it repulsive. Rubin points out that we have learned to value other cultures as unique without seeing them as inferior, and we need to adopt a similar understanding of different sexual cultures as well.{{citation needed|reason=no citation|date=November 2015}}
