'''Jeffrey Roger Goodwin''' (born January 28, 1958) is a [[professor]] of [[sociology]] at [[New York University]]. He holds a BA, MA (Sociology) and PhD (Sociology) from [[Harvard University]].

His research interests include [[social movements]], [[revolutions]], [[political violence]], and [[terrorism]].  He is a past chair of the Comparative and Historical Sociology Section and the Collective Behavior and Social Movements Section of the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA).

The underlying argument of his best known book, ''[[No Other Way Out|No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991]]'', is that [[revolutionary movements]] are not only a response to [[economic inequality]] or [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]], but are also a response to [[political repression]] and violence.

Goodwin has written and edited a number of works with his friend and former NYU colleague [[James M. Jasper]]. They wrote a famous critique of the political-opportunity theory developed by [[Charles Tilly]] and [[Doug McAdam]], republished in ''Rethinking Social Movements,'' which Goodwin and Jasper edited. They also edited ''The Contexts Reader'' (New York: W. W. Norton), ''Social Movements'' (Routledge), ''The Social Movements Reader'' (Wiley-Blackwell), and (with Francesca Polletta) ''Passionate Politics'' (University of Chicago Press), a leading work in the [[sociology of emotions]].

In October 2011, Goodwin was one of 132 New York University (NYU) faculty and staff members who signed a statement calling for disinvestment in several American companies that do business in Israel. In response to sharp criticism from Congressman [[Gary Ackerman]], Goodwin accused Ackerman of [[moral blindness]] and stated that "Ackerman's apparent denial that Israel is occupying Palestinian territories and systematically violating basic Palestinian rights is simply shocking."<ref>[http://wedivest.org/2011/10/rep-ackerman-attacks-over-100-nyu-professors-for-signing-divestment-letter/ Rep. Ackerman attacks over 100 NYU professors for signing divestment letter], Posted on Wedivest.org, October 21, 2011.</ref>
