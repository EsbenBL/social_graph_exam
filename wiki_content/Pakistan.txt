It is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by population|fifth-most populous country]], with a population exceeding 225.1 million, and has the world's [[Islam by country#Countries|second-largest Muslim population]]. Pakistan is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|33rd-largest country by area]], spanning {{convert|881,913|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}. It has a {{convert|1,046|km|mi|adj=mid|abbr=off}} coastline along the [[Arabian Sea]] and [[Gulf of Oman]] in the south, and is bordered by [[India]] to [[India–Pakistan border|the east]], [[Afghanistan]] to [[Durand Line|the west]], [[Iran]] to [[Iran–Pakistan border|the southwest]], and [[China]] to [[China–Pakistan border|the northeast]].

Perhaps most importantly in a South Asian context, the role played by zebu makes this a distinctive, localised development, with a character completely different to other parts of the world. Finally, the longevity of the site, and its articulation with the neighbouring site of Nausharo (c. 2800—2000&nbsp;BCE), provides a very clear continuity from South Asia's first farming villages to the emergence of its first cities (Jarrige, 1984)."</ref> and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] of the [[Bronze Age]], the most extensive of the civilisations of the [[Old World]].<ref>{{citation |last=Wright |first=Rita P. |title=The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MG2ztAEACAAJ |quote=The Indus civilisation is one of three in the 'Ancient East' that, along with Mesopotamia and Pharaonic Egypt, was a cradle of early civilisation in the Old World (Childe, 1950).

But, even for those who survived, fear generated a widespread perception that one could be safe only among members of one's own community; and this in turn helped consolidate loyalties towards the state, whether India or Pakistan, in which one might find a secure haven. This was especially important for Pakistan, where the succour it offered to Muslims gave that state for the first time a visible territorial reality.

The growing political power of the British in Bengal had not yet reached the territories of modern Pakistan.

The [[1946 Indian provincial elections|1946 elections]] resulted in the Muslim League winning 90&nbsp;percent of the seats reserved for Muslims. Thus, the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite in which the Indian Muslims were to vote on the creation of Pakistan, a plebiscite won by the Muslim League. This victory was assisted by the support given to the Muslim League by the support of the landowners of Sindh and Punjab.

Instead, all three of these South Asian states began their independent life as Realms within the British Commonwealth and mirrored the style and institutions of the Dominions of Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Though their sovereignty was in no way impaired by this seemingly ambiguous position they all held the British sovereign as their head of state who was represented in each capital by a governor- general appointed on the advice of the local prime minister. India, Pakistan and Ceylon were Realms from 1947 to 1950, 1947 to 1956 and 1948 to 1972 respectively.}}</ref>

The climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. There is a [[monsoon]] season with frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at all. There are four distinct seasons in Pakistan: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November.<ref name="congress" /> Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, and patterns of alternate flooding and drought are common.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Pakistan-CLIMATE.html |title=Pakistan Climate |publisher=Encyclopedia of the Nations |date=28 March 2008|access-date=16 March 2009}}</ref>

=== Flora and fauna ===
{{Main|Flora of Pakistan|Fauna of Pakistan}}
The diversity of the landscape and climate in Pakistan allows a wide variety of trees and plants to flourish. The forests range from coniferous [[alpine plant|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] trees such as [[spruce]], [[pine]], and [[deodar cedar]] in the extreme northern mountains to [[deciduous]] trees in most of the country (for example, the mulberry-like [[Dalbergia sissoo|shisham]] found in the [[Sulaiman Mountains]]), to palms such as [[coconut]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]] in the southern Punjab, southern Balochistan, and all of Sindh. The western hills are home to [[juniper]], [[tamarisk]], coarse grasses, and scrub plants. [[Mangrove]] forests form much of the coastal wetlands along the coast in the south.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wwfpak.org/forest_mangrove.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225000128/http://wwfpak.org/forest_mangrove.php |archive-date=25 December 2004 |title=Conservation of Mangrove Forests in the Coastal Areas of Sindh and Balochistan |website=WWF Pakistan|access-date=17 March 2009}}</ref>

Coniferous forests are found at altitudes ranging from {{convert|1,000|to|4000|m|abbr=off}} in most of the northern and northwestern highlands. In the [[xeric]] regions of Balochistan, date palm and ''[[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]]'' are common.

The first successful [[2013 Pakistani general election|democratic transition]] occurred in May 2013. Politics in Pakistan is centred on, and dominated by, a homegrown [[social philosophy]] comprising a blend of ideas from [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialism]], [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservatism]], and the [[third way]]. As of the [[2013 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 2013, the three main political parties in the country are: the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservative]] [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League-N]]; the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialist]] PPP; and the [[Centre politics|centrist]] and third-way [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|Pakistan Movement for Justice]] (PTI).
* [[Head of State]]: The [[President of Pakistan|President]], who is elected by an [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Electoral College]] is the ceremonial head of the state and is the civilian [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] (with the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] as principal military adviser), but military appointments and key confirmations in the armed forces are made by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] after reviewing the reports on candidates' merit and performance. Almost all appointed officers in the judicature, [[Pakistani military|military]], the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|chairman joint chiefs]], [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|joint staff]], and legislature require the executive confirmation from the Prime Minister, whom the President must consult by law. However, the powers to pardon and grant clemency lie with the President of Pakistan.
* [[Legislative]]: The [[bicameral]] legislature comprises a 104-member [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] ([[Upper House|upper house]]) and a 342-member [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] ([[Lower House|lower house]]). [[Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan|Members]] of the National Assembly are elected through the [[first-past-the-post]] system under [[universal adult suffrage]], representing electoral districts known as National Assembly [[Constituencies of Pakistan|constituencies]]. According to the constitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation. Senate members are elected by provincial legislators, with all the provinces having equal representation.
[[File:A night side view of Prime Minister's Secretariat Building.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prime Minister's Office (Pakistan)|Prime Minister's Office]]]]
* Executive: The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the [[majority rule]] party or a coalition in the [[National Assembly (Pakistan)|National Assembly]]— the [[lower house]]. The Prime Minister serves as the [[head of government]] and is designated to exercise as the country's chief executive. The Prime Minister is responsible for appointing a [[Cabinet of Pakistan|cabinet]] consisting of ministers and advisers as well as running the government operations, taking and authorising executive decisions, appointments and recommendations of [[Central Superior Services|senior civil servants]] that require executive confirmation of the Prime Minister.
* [[List of provincial governments of Pakistan|Provincial governments]]: Each of the [[Four Provinces (Pakistan)|four provinces]] has a similar [[List of Chief Ministers in Pakistan|system of government]], with a [[Elections in Pakistan|directly elected]] [[:Category:Provincial Assemblies of Pakistan|Provincial Assembly]] in which the leader of the largest party or coalition is elected [[Chief Minister (Pakistan)|Chief Minister]]. Chief Ministers oversee the [[List of provincial governments of Pakistan|provincial governments]] and head the provincial cabinet. It is common in Pakistan to have different ruling parties or coalitions in each of the provinces. The provincial bureaucracy is headed by the [[Chief Secretary (Pakistan)|Chief Secretary]], who is appointed by the Prime Minister. The provincial assemblies have power to make laws and approve the provincial budget which is commonly presented by the provincial finance minister every fiscal year. [[List of Governors of Pakistan|Provincial governors]] who are the ceremonial heads of the provinces are appointed by the President.<ref name="ciafactbook" />
[[File:Supreme Court of Pakistan, Islamabad by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supreme Court of Pakistan]]]]
* [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judicature]]: The judiciary of Pakistan is a hierarchical system with two classes of courts: the superior (or higher) judiciary and the subordinate (or lower) judiciary. The [[Chief Justice of Pakistan]] is the [[chief judge]] who oversees the judicature's [[Court system of Pakistan|court system]] at all levels of command. The superior judiciary is composed of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]], the [[Federal Shariat Court]] and five [[High courts of Pakistan|high courts]], with the Supreme Court at the apex. The [[Constitution of Pakistan]] entrusts the superior judiciary with the obligation to preserve, protect and defend the constitution. Other regions of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan have separate court systems.

=== Military history ===
Since 1947 Pakistan has been involved in [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|four]] [[Conventional warfare|conventional wars]]. [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948|The first]] occurred in Kashmir with Pakistan gaining control of [[Western Kashmir]], (Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan), and India retaining [[Eastern Kashmir]] (Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh). Territorial problems eventually led to [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|another conventional war]] in 1965. The issue of [[East Bengali refugees|Bengali refugees]] led to another war in 1971 which resulted in Pakistan's [[Pakistani Instrument of Surrender|unconditional surrender]] in East Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |title=War History |url=http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/AWPReview/TextContent.aspx?pId=47&rnd=443 |website=Pakistan Army |access-date=24 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225060835/http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/AWPReview/TextContent.aspx?pId=47&rnd=443 |archive-date=25 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tensions in Kargil brought the two countries at the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1999|brink of war]].<ref name="kargil" /> Since 1947 the unresolved [[Durand Line|territorial problems]] with [[Afghanistan]] saw [[Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes|border skirmishes]] which were kept mostly at the [[Afghanistan Pakistan border|mountainous border]].

The structure of the Pakistani economy has changed from [[Agriculture in Pakistan|a mainly agricultural]] to a strong service base. Agriculture {{As of|2015|lc=y}} accounts for only 20.9% of the GDP.<ref name="DSEC">{{cite web |title=Pakistan Economic Survey 2014–15 |url=http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_15/Highlights.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Finance|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> Even so, according to the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], Pakistan produced 21,591,400 metric tons of wheat in 2005, more than all of Africa (20,304,585 metric tons) and nearly as much as all of South America (24,557,784 metric tons).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbp.org.pk/departments/stats/PakEconomy_HandBook/Chap-1.2.pdf |title=Sectoral Share in Gross Domestic Product |year=2010 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Statistics |page=10|access-date=30 December 2011}}</ref> Majority of the population, directly or indirectly, is dependent on this sector.

A large portion of the country's manufactured exports is dependent on raw materials such as cotton and hides that are part of the agriculture sector, while supply shortages and market disruptions in farm products do push up inflationary pressures. The country is also the fifth-largest producer of cotton, with cotton production of 14&nbsp;million bales from a modest beginning of 1.7&nbsp;million bales in the early 1950s; is self-sufficient in sugarcane; and is the fourth-largest producer in the world of milk. Land and water resources have not risen proportionately, but the increases have taken place mainly due to gains in labour and agriculture productivity. The major breakthrough in crop production took place in the late 1960s and 1970s due to the [[Green Revolution]] that made a significant contribution to land and yield increases of wheat and rice. Private tube wells led to a 50 percent increase in the cropping intensity which was augmented by tractor cultivation. While the tube wells raised crop yields by 50 percent, the High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of wheat and rice led to a 50–60 percent higher yield.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NnB-wi4YIZYJ:https://ishrathusain.iba.edu.pk/speeches/New/AgricultureSector_Issues_n_Prospects.docx+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=au |title=AGRICULTURE SECTOR: ISSUES AND PROSPECTS|access-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> Meat industry accounts for 1.4 percent of overall GDP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapter_10/03_Manufacturing.pdf |title=Manufacturing in Pakistan |publisher=Government of Pakistan|access-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

Industry is the second-largest sector of the economy, accounting for 19.74% of gross domestic product (GDP), and 24 percent of total employment. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM), at 12.2% of GDP, dominates the overall sector, accounting for 66% of the sectoral share, followed by small-scale manufacturing, which accounts for 4.9% of total GDP. Pakistan's cement industry is also fast growing mainly because of demand from [[Afghanistan]] and from the domestic real estate sector. In 2013 Pakistan exported 7,708,557 [[metric tons]] of cement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apcma.com/data_export.html |title=All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association Export Data |publisher=Apcma.com|access-date=15 October 2013}}</ref> Pakistan has an installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons of cement and 42,636,428 metric tons of clinker.

The [[Textile industry in Pakistan|textile industry]] has a pivotal position in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan. In Asia, Pakistan is the eighth-largest exporter of textile products, contributing 9.5% to the GDP and providing employment to around 15&nbsp;million people (some 30% of the 49&nbsp;million people in the workforce). Pakistan is the fourth-largest producer of cotton with the third-largest spinning capacity in Asia after China and India, contributing 5% to the global spinning capacity.<ref>{{cite news |title=Statistics on textile industry in Pakistan |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/522292/statistics-on-textile-industry-in-pakistan/|access-date=4 March 2017 |work=[[Express Tribune]] |date=18 March 2013}}</ref> China is the second largest buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527&nbsp;billion of textiles last fiscal.

{{Main|Motorways of Pakistan}}
[[File:M2-Motorway.jpg|thumb|The motorway passes through the [[Salt Range]] mountains]]
Motorways of Pakistan are a network of multiple-lane, high-speed, [[controlled-access highway]]s in Pakistan, which are owned, maintained, and operated federally by Pakistan's [[National Highway Authority]]. As of 20 February 2020, 1882&nbsp;km of motorways are operational, while an additional 1854&nbsp;km are under construction or planned. All motorways in Pakistan are pre-fixed with the letter 'M' (for "Motorway") followed by the unique numerical designation of the specific highway (with a hyphen in the middle), e.g. "M-1".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nha.gov.pk/en/|title=National Highways Authority – Committed to Excellence|access-date=16 March 2020|archive-date=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226015353/http://nha.gov.pk/en/%20|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Pakistan's motorways are an important part of Pakistan's "National Trade Corridor Project",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/81261/40075-pak-seia-0.pdf|title=Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility Pakistan: National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program|publisher=[[Asian Development Bank|ADB]]|date=April 2007|access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref> which aims to link Pakistan's three [[Arabian Sea]] ports ([[Karachi Port]], [[Port Bin Qasim]] and [[Gwadar Port]]) to the rest of the country through its national highways and motorways network and further north with [[Afghanistan]], [[Central Asia]] and China. The project was planned in 1990. The [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] project aims to link [[Gwadar Port]] and [[Kashgar]] (China) using Pakistani motorways, [[National Highways of Pakistan|national highways]], and [[Expressways of Pakistan|expressways]].

====Highways====
{{See also|National Highways of Pakistan}}
Highways form the backbone of Pakistan's transport system; a total road length of {{convert|263,942|km|mi|abbr=off}} accounts for 92% of passengers and 96% of inland freight traffic. Road transport services are largely in the hands of the [[Privatization in Pakistan|private sector]]. The National Highway Authority is responsible for the maintenance of national highways and motorways. The highway and motorway system depends mainly on north–south links connecting the southern ports to the populous provinces of Punjab and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]].

The [[Pakistan Railways]], under the [[Ministry of Railways (Pakistan)|Ministry of Railways]] (MoR), operates the railroad system. From 1947 until the 1970s the [[Pakistan Railways|train system]] was the primary means of transport until the nationwide constructions of the national highways and the [[economic boom]] of the [[Cars in Pakistan|automotive industry]]. Beginning in the 1990s there was a marked shift in traffic from rail to highways; dependence grew on roads after the introduction of [[Automotive industry in Pakistan|vehicles]] in the country. Now the railway's share of inland traffic is below 8% for passengers and 4% for freight traffic.<ref name="DSEC" /> As personal transportation began to be dominated by the automobile, total rail track decreased from {{convert|8,775|km|abbr=off}} in 1990–91 to {{convert|7,791|km|abbr=off}} in 2011.<ref name="pc" /><ref name="nation">{{cite web |title=PAKISTAN |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Pakistan.html |website=Encyclopedia Nation|access-date=31 December 2011}}</ref> Pakistan expects to use the rail service to boost [[Foreign trade of Pakistan|foreign trade]] with China, Iran, and Turkey.<ref>{{cite news |author=Syed Fazl-e-Haider |title=China-Pakistan rail link on horizon |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IB24Df02.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226192640/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IB24Df02.html|url-status=unfit|archive-date=26 February 2007|access-date=31 December 2011 |newspaper=Asia Times Online |date=24 February 2007}}<br>- {{cite news |title=Pakistan-Turkey rail trial starts |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8201934.stm|access-date=13 March 2012 |work=BBC News |date=14 August 2009}}</ref>

=== Urbanisation ===
{{Main|Urbanisation in Pakistan}}
[[File:Kalma Underpass1.jpg|[[Kalma Underpass]], [[Lahore]]|thumb]]
Since [[Independence of Pakistan|achieving independence]] as a result of the [[partition of India]], the [[Urbanisation in Pakistan|urbanisation]] has increased exponentially, with several different causes. The majority of the population in the south resides along the Indus River, with [[Karachi]] the most populous commercial city.<ref name="The Urban Frontier—Karachi" /> In the east, west, and north, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of [[Lahore]], [[Faisalabad]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Islamabad]], [[Sargodha]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Sialkot]], [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Jhelum]], [[Sheikhupura]], [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]], [[Mardan]], and [[Peshawar]]. During the period 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.<ref name="Jason Burke" /> [[Immigration to Pakistan|Immigration]], from both within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the [[1998 Pakistan Census|1998 national census]] highlighted the significance of the [[partition of India]] in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan.<ref name="Clark">{{cite book |last=Clark |first=David |title=The Elgar Companion to Development Studies |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=978-1-84376-475-5 |page=668}}</ref>
During and after the independence period, [[Muhajir (Urdu-speaking people)|Urdu speaking Muslims]] from India migrated in large numbers to Pakistan, especially to the port city of [[Karachi]], which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan. [[Immigration to Pakistan|Migration from other countries]], mainly from those nearby, has further accelerated the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities. Inevitably, the rapid urbanisation caused by these large population movements has also created new political and socio-economic challenges. In addition to immigration, economic trends such as the green revolution and political developments, among a host of other factors, are also important causes of urbanisation.<ref name="Clark" /> {{Largest cities of Pakistan}}

The population of Pakistan follow different religions. Most of Pakistanis are Muslims (96.47%) followed by [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindus]] (2.14%) and [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christians]] (1.27%). There are also people in Pakistan who follow other religions, such as [[Sikhism in Pakistan|Sikhism]], [[Buddhism in Pakistan|Buddhism]], [[Jainism in Pakistan|Jainism]] and the minority of [[Parsi]] (who follow [[Zoroastrianism]]). The [[Kalash people]] maintain a unique identity and religion within Pakistan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pakistan's Forgotten Pagans Get Their Due |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/28439107.html |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=19 April 2017}}</ref>

Hinduism is mostly associated with [[Sindhis]], and Pakistan hosts major events such as the [[Hinglaj_Mata_mandir#Annual_pilgrimage_(Hinglaj_Yatra_or_Theerth_Yatra)|Hinglaj Yatra]] pilgrimage. Hindu temples may be found [[Hinduism in Sindh Province|throughout Sindh]], where the dharma features prominently. Many Hindus in Pakistan complain about the prospect of religious violence against them and being treated like second-class citizens, and many have emigrated to India or further abroad.<ref name="bbc200703022">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6367773.stm |title=Hindus feel the heat in Pakistan |last=Sohail |first=Riaz |date=2 March 2007 |work=BBC News |quote=But many Hindu families who stayed in Pakistan after partition have already lost faith and migrated to India.|access-date=22 February 2011}}</ref>

In addition, some Pakistanis also do not profess any faith (such as [[atheism|atheists]] and [[agnosticism|agnostics]]) in Pakistan. According to the 1998 census, people who did not state their religion accounted for 0.5% of the population. [[Secularism]] and criticism of over-religiosity is not uncommon in well-educated civil society, although in general Pakistan is a highly religious society, and the [[irreligion|irreligious]] generally hide their beliefs due to fear of persecution.

[[Sufism]], a mystical Islamic tradition, has a long history and a large following among the Sunni Muslims in Pakistan, at both the academic and popular levels.

There are two levels of [[Sufism]] in Pakistan. The first is the 'populist' Sufism of the rural population. This level of Sufism involves belief in intercession through saints, veneration of their shrines, and forming bonds (Mureed) with a ''pir'' (saint). Many rural Pakistani Muslims associate with [[Pir (Sufism)|''pirs'']] and seek their intercession.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0616 |title=Pakistan |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World |quote=Sūfī Islam in Pakistan is represented at two levels. The first is the populist Sufism of the rural masses, associated with unorthodox religious rituals and practices, belief in the intercessory powers of saints, pilgrimage and veneration at their shrines, and a binding spiritual relationship between the shaykh or pir (master) and murīd (disciple). Many Muslims in rural areas of Pakistan, where orthodox Islam has yet to penetrate effectively, identify themselves with some pir, living or dead, and seek his intercession for the solution of their worldly problems and for salvation in the hereafter.}}</ref> The second level of Sufism in Pakistan is 'intellectual Sufism', which is growing among the urban and educated population. They are influenced by the writings of Sufis such as the medieval theologian [[al-Ghazali]], the Sufi reformer [[Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi|Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindi]], and [[Shah Wali Allah]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0616 |title=Pakistan |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World |quote=The other strain is that of scholastic or intellectual Sufism, a recent phenomenon based in urban areas and becoming increasingly popular in educated circles.

Sharif]] and [[Syed Zafarul Hasan|Zafar Hassan]] established the first major Pakistani philosophical movement in 1947.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}<!--Did this movement have a name?--><ref>{{cite web |display-authors=etal |author=Richard V.

{{Main|Pakistani architecture|Hindu and Buddhist architectural heritage of Pakistan}}
[[File:Minar e Pakistan night image.jpg|[[Minar-e-Pakistan]] is a national monument marking Pakistan's independence movement.|thumb]]
Four periods are recognised in Pakistani architecture: [[History of Pakistan#Early history|pre-Islamic]], [[History of Pakistan#Muslim period|Islamic]], [[History of Pakistan#Colonial era|colonial]], and [[History of Pakistan#Independence|post-colonial]]. With the beginning of the [[Indus civilization]] around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE,<ref>{{cite web |author=Vidja Dehejia |title=South Asian Art and Culture |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sasa/hd_sasa.htm |website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=10 February 2008}}</ref> an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this day.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Indus Valley And The Genesis Of South Asian Civilization |url=http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm |website=History World International |access-date=6 February 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68HwtFCFs?url=http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm |archive-date=9 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]], Harappa, and [[Kot Diji]] are among the pre-Islamic settlements that are now tourist attractions.<ref name="mountains" /> The rise of [[Buddhism]] and the influence of [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|Greek]] civilisation led to the development of a [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] style,<ref>Sachindra Kumar Maity.

The high point of this era was the [[Gandhara#Art|Gandhara style]]. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery [[Takht Bhai|Takht-i-Bahi]] in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.<ref>{{cite web |title=UNESCO Advisory Body Evaluation of Takht Bhai |publisher=International Council on Monuments and Sites |pages=1–2 |url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/140.pdf |date=29 December 1979|access-date=25 July 2010}}</ref>

The arrival of Islam in what is today Pakistan meant the sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless [[Islamic architecture]]. The most important [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]]-style building still standing is the [[Rukn-e-Alam|tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam]] in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of Persian-Islamic architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of Hindustani art. Lahore, as the occasional residence of Mughal rulers, contains many important buildings from the empire. Most prominent among them are the [[Badshahi Mosque]], the [[Lahore Fort|fortress of Lahore]] with the famous [[Alamgiri Gate]], the colourful, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]]-style [[Wazir Khan Mosque]],<ref>Simon Ross Valentine. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&pg=PA63 'Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice] Hurst Publishers, 2008 {{ISBN|1-85065-916-8}} p. 63</ref> the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] in Lahore, and the [[Shahjahan Mosque]] in [[Thatta]]. In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures such as the [[Faisal Mosque]], the [[Minar-e-Pakistan]], and the [[Mazar-e-Quaid]]. Several examples of architectural infrastructure demonstrating the influence of [[Architecture of the United Kingdom|British design]] can be found in [[Lahore]], [[Peshawar]], and [[Karachi]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kamil Khan Mumtaz |title=Architecture in Pakistan |year=1985 |publisher=Concept Media Pte Ltd |isbn=978-9971-84-141-6 |pages=32, 51, 160}}</ref>
