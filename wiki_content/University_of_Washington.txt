The '''University of Washington''' ('''UW''', simply '''Washington''', or informally '''U-Dub''')<ref>"Dub" being a phonetic shorthand for "W" ("double-you").</ref> is a [[Public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Founded in 1861, Washington is one of the oldest universities on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]; it was established in [[Seattle]] approximately a decade after the city's founding [[List of technology centers|to aid its economic development]]. Today, the university's 703 acre [[Campus of the University of Washington|main Seattle campus]] is in the [[University District, Seattle|University District]], [[Puget Sound region]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]]<!--, in one of the [[List of technology centers|largest technology clusters]] in the world-->. The university also has campuses in [[University of Washington Tacoma|Tacoma]] and [[University of Washington Bothell|Bothell]]. Overall, UW encompasses over 500 buildings and over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with more than 26 university libraries, as well as the [[UW Tower]], lecture halls, art centers, museums, laboratories, stadiums, and conference centers. The university offers degrees through 140 departments in various colleges and schools, and functions on a quarter system.

Washington is a member of the [[Association of American Universities]] and is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".<ref name="Carnegie">{{cite web |title=Carnegie Classifications Institution Lookup |url=https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=236948 |publisher=Center for Postsecondary Education |website=carnegieclassifications.iu.edu |access-date=July 26, 2020}}</ref> According to the [[National Science Foundation]], UW spent $1.41 billion on research and development in 2018, ranking it 5th in the nation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Table 20.

==History==
[[File:Territorial University of Washington - c1870.jpg|left|thumb|The original University building, {{circa}} 1870.]]

===Founding===
In 1854, territorial [[governor]] [[Isaac Stevens]] recommended the establishment of a university in the [[Washington Territory]]. Prominent Seattle-area residents, including [[Methodist]] preacher [[Daniel Bagley]], saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige. Bagley learned of a law that allowed United States territories to sell land to raise money in support of public schools. At the time, [[Arthur A. Denny]], one of the founders of Seattle and a member of the territorial legislature, aimed to increase the city's importance by moving the territory's capital from [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] to Seattle. However, Bagley eventually convinced Denny that the establishment of a university would assist more in the development of Seattle's economy. Two universities were initially chartered, but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in [[Lewis County, Washington|Lewis County]] provided that locally donated land was available. When no site emerged, Denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider Seattle as a location in 1858.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kuow.org/post/founding-university-washington-one-student-time |title=Founding The University Of Washington, One Student At A Time |last=Banel |first=Feliks |date=October 8, 2012 |website=KUOW.org |publisher=[[KUOW-FM]] |access-date=December 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101194300/http://kuow.org/post/founding-university-washington-one-student-time |archive-date=January 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="ws">{{cite book |last1=Speidel |first1=William |title=Sons of the Profits |date=1967 |publisher=Nettle Creek Publishing Company |location=Seattle |pages=81–103}}</ref>

[[File:Territorial University students, Seattle, 1864 (PEISER 89).jpeg|thumb|Territorial University students in 1864]]
In 1861, scouting began for an appropriate {{convert|10|acre|ha|0}} site in Seattle to serve as a new university campus. Arthur and Mary Denny donated eight acres, while fellow pioneers Edward Lander, and Charlie and Mary Terry, donated two acres on Denny's Knoll in [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown Seattle]].<ref name="bhatt">{{citation|last=Bhatt|first=Sanjay|title=UW has big plans for its prime downtown Seattle real estate|date=October 3, 2013|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2021960534_mettractxml.html|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=October 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005022707/http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2021960534_mettractxml.html|archive-date=October 5, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> More specifically, this tract was bounded by 4th Avenue to the west, 6th Avenue to the east, Union Street to the north, and Seneca Streets to the south.

[[File:Territorial University grammar class group portrait, Seattle, 1883 (PEISER 117).jpeg|thumb|Grammar, Class of 1883]]
John Pike, for whom [[Pike Street (Seattle)|Pike Street]] is named, was the university's architect and builder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2017/01/chs-retake-pikes-place-on-capitol-hill/|title=CHS Re:Take – Pike's place on Capitol Hill|date=January 15, 2017|access-date=October 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030205827/http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2017/01/chs-retake-pikes-place-on-capitol-hill/|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was opened on November 4, 1861, as the Territorial University of Washington. The legislature passed articles incorporating the university, and establishing its Board of Regents in 1862. The school initially struggled, closing three times: in 1863 for low enrollment, and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage. Washington awarded its first graduate [[Clara Antoinette McCarty Wilt]] in 1876, with a [[bachelor's degree]] in science.

===19th century relocation===
By the time [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] entered the [[United States|Union]] in 1889, both Seattle and the university had grown substantially. Washington's total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students, and the campus's relative isolation in downtown Seattle faced encroaching development. A special legislative committee, headed by UW graduate [[Edmond Meany]], was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty. The committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown Seattle]] called [[Union Bay (Seattle, Washington)|Union Bay]], which was the land of the [[Duwamish people|Duwamish]], and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and construction. In 1895, the university relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built [[Denny Hall]]. The University Regents tried and failed to sell the old campus, eventually settling with leasing the area. This would later become one of the university's most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day Seattle, generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the [[Metropolitan Tract (Seattle)|Metropolitan Tract]]. The original Territorial University building was torn down in 1908, and its former site now houses the [[Fairmont Olympic Hotel]].

The sole-surviving remnants of Washington's first building are four {{convert|24|ft|adj=on}}, white, hand-fluted cedar, Ionic columns. They were salvaged by [[Edmond S. Meany]], one of the university's first graduates and former head of its history department. Meany and his colleague, Dean Herbert T. Condon, dubbed the columns as "Loyalty," "Industry," "Faith", and "Efficiency", or "LIFE." The columns now stand in the [[Sylvan Grove Theater and Columns|Sylvan Grove Theater]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The University of Washington's Early Years |title=No Finer Site: The University of Washington's Early Years On Union Bay |chapter-url=http://www.lib.washington.edu/specialcollections/collections/exhibits/site/early |work=University Libraries |publisher=University of Washington |access-date=April 29, 2015}}</ref>
[[File:Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition - Rainier Vista.jpg|thumb|Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition on the UW campus toward [[Mount Rainier]] in 1909]]

===20th century expansion===
Organizers of the 1909 [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their [[World's Fair|world's fair]]. They came to an agreement with Washington's [[Board of Regents]] that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition, surrounding today's [[Drumheller Fountain]] facing towards [[Mount Rainier]]. In exchange, organizers agreed Washington would take over the campus and its development after the fair's conclusion. This arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several new buildings, prepared in part by [[John Charles Olmsted]]. The plan was later incorporated into the overall UW campus master plan, permanently affecting the campus layout.

Both [[World War]]s brought the military to campus, with certain facilities temporarily lent to the federal government. In spite of this, subsequent post-war periods were times of dramatic growth for the university.<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Washington|url=http://depts.washington.edu/depress/university_washington.shtml|publisher=Great Depression in Washington State Project|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925014239/http://depts.washington.edu/depress/university_washington.shtml|archive-date=September 25, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Interwar period|period between the wars]] saw a significant expansion of the upper campus. Construction of the [[Liberal Arts Quadrangle]], known to students as "The Quad," began in 1916 and continued to 1939. The university's architectural centerpiece, [[Suzzallo Library]], was built in 1926 and expanded in 1935.

After [[World War II]], further growth came with the [[G.I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]]. Among the most important developments of this period was the opening of the [[University of Washington School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] in 1946, which is now consistently ranked as the top [[medical school]] in the United States. It would eventually lead to the [[University of Washington Medical Center]], ranked by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' as one of the top ten hospitals in the nation.

[[File:Uwaerial1922.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of campus, circa 1922.]]

In 1942, all [[Japanese Americans|persons of Japanese ancestry]] in the Seattle area were forced into inland [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] as part of [[Executive Order 9066]] following the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. During this difficult time, university president [[Lee Paul Sieg]] took an active and sympathetic leadership role in advocating for and facilitating the transfer of Japanese American students to universities and colleges away from the Pacific Coast to help them avoid the mass incarceration.<ref name=exigenciesII>{{cite web | title=Phase II — A Place for Some of Our Best Students | url = https://www.lib.washington.edu/specialcollections/collections/exhibits/harmony/interrupted/phase2| access-date=May 17, 2020}}</ref> Nevertheless, many Japanese American students and "soon-to-be" graduates were unable to transfer successfully in the short time window or receive diplomas before being incarcerated. It was only many years later that they would be recognized for their accomplishments, during the University of Washington's [[The Long Journey Home (ceremonial event)|Long Journey Home]] ceremonial event that was held in May 2008.

From 1958 to 1973, the University of Washington saw a tremendous growth in student enrollment, its faculties and operating budget, and also its prestige under the leadership of [[Charles Odegaard]]. UW student enrollment had more than doubled to 34,000 as the [[post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] generation came of age. However, this era was also marked by high levels of [[student activism]], as was the case at many American universities. Much of the unrest focused around [[civil rights]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/BSU_intro.htm|title=The Black Student Union at UW: Black Power on Campus|publisher=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007071347/http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/BSU_intro.htm|archive-date=October 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_student.shtml|title=Student Activism at UW, 1948–1970|last=Kindig|first=Jesse|publisher=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424200237/http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_student.shtml|archive-date=April 24, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to anti-Vietnam War protests by the late 1960s, the University Safety and Security Division became the University of Washington Police Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/admin/police/about/history.html|title=UW Police Department: History|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101112410/http://www.washington.edu/admin/police/about/history.html|archive-date=November 1, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Odegaard instituted a vision of building a "community of scholars", convincing the Washington State legislatures to increase investment in the university. Washington [[United States Senate|senators]], such as [[Henry M. Jackson]] and [[Warren G. Magnuson]], also used their political clout to gather research funds for UW. The results included an increase in the operating budget from $37 million in 1958 to over $400 million in 1973, solidifying UW as a top recipient of federal research funds in the United States. The establishment of technology giants such as [[Microsoft]], [[Boeing]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] in the local area also proved to be highly influential in the UW's fortunes, not only improving graduate prospects<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paysa.com/blog/2017/06/05/top-colleges-in-tech/|title=Top Colleges in Tech {{!}} Paysa Blog|website=www.paysa.com|language=en-US|access-date=August 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803132603/https://www.paysa.com/blog/2017/06/05/top-colleges-in-tech/|archive-date=August 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/26/how-long-youll-need-to-go-to-school-to-work-at-top-tech-companies.html|title=Here's how much education you need to work at top tech companies|last=Hess|first=Abigail|date=July 26, 2017|access-date=August 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803134340/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/26/how-long-youll-need-to-go-to-school-to-work-at-top-tech-companies.html|archive-date=August 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> but also helping to attract millions of dollars in university and research funding through its distinguished faculty and extensive alumni network.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washington.edu/giving/recognition/gates-volunteer-service-award/about-the-gates-family/|title=About the Gates family {{!}} Give to the UW|website=www.washington.edu|language=en|access-date=August 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801231844/https://www.washington.edu/giving/recognition/gates-volunteer-service-award/about-the-gates-family/|archive-date=August 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>[[File:Drumhellerfountain.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Rainier]] viewed from [[Drumheller Fountain]]]]

===21st century===
In 1990, the University of Washington opened its additional campuses in [[University of Washington Bothell|Bothell]] and [[University of Washington Tacoma|Tacoma]]. Although originally intended for students who have already completed two years of higher education, both schools have since become four-year universities with the authority to grant degrees. The first freshman classes at these campuses started in fall 2006. Today both Bothell and Tacoma also offer a selection of master's degree programs.

In 2012, the university began exploring plans and governmental approval to expand the main [[Seattle]] campus, including significant increases in student housing, teaching facilities for the growing student body and faculty, as well as expanded public transit options. The [[University of Washington light rail station]] was completed in March 2015,<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/university-link-light-rail-service-starts-march-19/|title=University Link light-rail service starts March 19|date=January 26, 2016|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=August 1, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713045342/http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/university-link-light-rail-service-starts-march-19/|archive-date=July 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> connecting Seattle's [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] neighborhood to the UW Husky Stadium within five minutes of rail travel time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seattle.curbed.com/2016/3/17/11251862/uw-capitol-hill-light-rail-stations-open-on-saturday|title=UW & Capitol Hill Light Rail Stations Are Ready|last=Keeley|first=Sean|date=March 17, 2016|website=Curbed Seattle|access-date=August 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801233448/https://seattle.curbed.com/2016/3/17/11251862/uw-capitol-hill-light-rail-stations-open-on-saturday|archive-date=August 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It offers a previously unavailable option of transportation into and out of the campus, designed specifically to reduce dependence on private vehicles, bicycles and local [[King County, Washington|King County]] buses.

==Campus==
{{Main|Campus of the University of Washington}}
UW's main campus is situated in [[Seattle]], by the shores of [[Union Bay (Seattle, Washington)|Union]] and [[Portage Bay]]s with views of the [[Cascade Range]] to the east, and the [[Olympic Mountains]] to the west. The site encompasses {{convert|703|acre|km2|sp=us}} bounded by N.E. 45th Street on the north, N.E. Pacific Street on the south, Montlake Boulevard N.E. on the east, and 15th Avenue N.E. on the west.

[[Red Square (University of Washington)|Red Square]] is the heart of the campus, surrounded by landmark buildings and artworks, such as [[Suzzallo Library]], the ''[[Broken Obelisk]]'', and the [[Statue of George Washington (Seattle)|statue of George Washington]]. It functions as the central hub for students and hosts a variety of events annually. University Way, known locally as "[[The Ave]]", lies nearby and is a focus for much student life at the university.

The university is governed by ten Regents, one of whom is a student. Its most notable former regent is likely [[William H. Gates, Sr.]], the father of [[Bill Gates]]. The undergraduate student government is the [[Associated Students of the University of Washington]] (ASUW) and the graduate student government is the [[Graduate and Professional Student Senate]] (GPSS).

===Finances===
In 2017 the university reported $4.893 billion in revenues and $5.666 billion in expenses, resulting in an operating loss of $774 million. This loss was offset by $342 million in state appropriations, $443 million in investment income, $166 million in gifts, and $185 million of other non-operating revenues.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://finance.uw.edu/treasury/sites/default/files/2017%20Bondholders%20Report.pdf|title=2017 Bondholder Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511012734/https://finance.uw.edu/treasury/sites/default/files/2017%20Bondholders%20Report.pdf|archive-date=May 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Thus, the university's net position increased by $363 million in 2017.<ref name=":2" />

===Sustainability===
[[Environmental sustainability]] has long been a major focus of the university's Board of Regents and Presidents. In February 2006, the UW joined a partnership with Seattle City Light as part of their Green Up Program, ensuring that all of Seattle campus' electricity is supplied by and purchased from renewable sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/news/detail.asp?ID=5867&Dept=40|title=Mayor Announces UW Green Energy Purchase|date=February 2006|publisher=City of Seattle|access-date=February 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116004704/http://www.seattle.gov/news/detail.asp?ID=5867&Dept=40|archive-date=January 16, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2010, then UW President Emmert furthered the university's efforts with a host of other universities across the U.S., and signed the [[American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/html/signatories.php|title=Who's Who |work=American College & University|publisher=Presidentsclimatecommitment.org|access-date=September 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726041616/http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/html/signatories.php|archive-date=July 26, 2009}}</ref> UW created a Climate Action Team,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/news/archive/id/46996 |title=UW seeks to deepen its commitment to sustainability |last=Roseth|first=Robert|date=February 5, 2009|access-date=September 16, 2010}}</ref> as well as an Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee (ESAC) which keeps track of UW's greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/about/environmentalstewardship/UW_GHG_inventory_2005.pdf|title=About the Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee (ESAC)|date=August 10, 2004|publisher=Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee|access-date=September 16, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305002357/http://www.washington.edu/about/environmentalstewardship/UW_GHG_inventory_2005.pdf|archive-date=March 5, 2009}}</ref> Policies were enacted with environmental stewardship in mind, and institutional support was provided to assist with campus sustainability.<ref name="Environmental Stewardship">{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/about/environmentalstewardship/|title=Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee|publisher=University of Washington|access-date=May 21, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517051607/http://www.washington.edu/about/environmentalstewardship/|archive-date=May 17, 2008}}</ref>

Additionally, UW's Student Housing and Food Services (HFS) office has dedicated several million dollars annually towards locally produced, [[Organic food|organic]], and natural foods. HFS also ceased the use of [[foam food container]]s on-campus, and instead opted for compostable cups, plates, utensils, and packaging whenever possible. New residence halls planned for 2020 are also expected to meet silver or gold [[LEED standards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hfs.washington.edu/about_hfs/default.aspx?id=2228|title=Housing and Food Services: Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability|publisher=University of Washington |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725000650/http://www.hfs.washington.edu/about_hfs/default.aspx?id=2228 |archive-date=July 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Overall, the University of Washington was one of several universities to receive the highest grade, "A-", on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card in 2011.<ref name="Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card">{{cite web|url=http://www.endowmentinstitute.org/|title=College Sustainability Report Card 2008|publisher=Sustainable Endowments Institute|access-date=May 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717115307/http://www.endowmentinstitute.org/|archive-date=July 17, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The university was one of 15 Overall College Sustainability Leaders, among the 300 institutions surveyed.<ref name="uwnews.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/archive/id/44022|title=UW again receives grade of A- for sustainability|date=September 26, 2008|access-date=September 16, 2010}}</ref>

====Student government====
{{Main|Associated Students of the University of Washington}}
The Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) is one of two Student Governments at the University of Washington, the other being the Graduate and Professional Student Senate. It is funded and supported by student fees, and provides services that directly and indirectly benefit them. The ASUW employs over 72 current University of Washington students, has over 500 volunteers, and spends $1.03 million annually to provide services and activities to the student body of 43,000 on-campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://depts.washington.edu/safcom/programs/asuw/|title=Associated Students of the University of Washington {{!}} SAF {{!}} Services and Activities Fee|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=November 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118003658/https://depts.washington.edu/safcom/programs/asuw/|archive-date=November 18, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Student Senate was established in 1994 as a division of the Associated Students of the University of Washington. Student Senate is one of two official student governed bodies and provides a broad-based discussion of issues. Currently, the ASUW Student Senate has a legislative body of over 150 senators representing a diverse set of interests on and off-campus.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://senate.asuw.org/history/ |title=History |website=senate.asuw.org |access-date=November 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117225445/http://senate.asuw.org/history/ |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The ASUW was incorporated in the State of Washington on April 20, 1906.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/search_results.aspx?search_type=simple&criteria=all&name_type=contains&name=Associated+Students+of+the+University+of+Washington&ubi=|title=Corporations Division|publisher=Washington Secretary of State|access-date=October 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112225349/http://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/search_results.aspx?search_type=simple&criteria=all&name_type=contains&name=Associated+Students+of+the+University+of+Washington&ubi=|archive-date=January 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 30, 1932, the ASUW assisted in the incorporation of [[University Book Store]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/search_results.aspx?search_type=simple&criteria=all&name_type=contains&name=University+Book+Store&ubi=|title=Corporations Division|publisher=Washington Secretary of State|access-date=October 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112215654/http://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/search_results.aspx?search_type=simple&criteria=all&name_type=contains&name=University+Book+Store&ubi=|archive-date=January 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> which has been in continuous operation at the same location on University Way for over 70 years. The [[ASUW Experimental College]], part of the ASUW, was created in 1968 by several University of Washington students seeking to provide the campus and surrounding community with a selection of classes not offered on the university curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/asuwxpcl/about.php/|title=Experimental College|access-date=December 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105172357/https://depts.washington.edu/asuwxpcl/about.php|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Publication===
{{Main|The Daily of the University of Washington}}
The student newspaper is ''[[The Daily of the University of Washington]]'', usually referred to as ''The Daily''. It is the second-largest{{clarify|date=January 2021}} daily paper in Seattle. ''The Daily'' is published every day classes are in session during fall, winter and spring quarters, and weekly during summer quarters. In 2010, ''The Daily'' launched a half-hour weekly television magazine show, "The Daily's Double Shot," on [[UWTV]] Channel 27. The UW continues to use its proprietary [[UWTV]] channel, online and printed publications.<ref name="UWTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.uwtv.org/|title=UWTV|publisher=UWTV|access-date=June 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609230447/http://www.uwtv.org/|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The faculty also produce their own publications for students and alumni.

===Student Activism===
Throughout the 20th Century, UW student activism centered around a variety of national and international concerns, from [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] to the [[Vietnam War]] and [[civil rights]]. In 1948, at the beginning of the [[McCarthyism]] era, students brought their activism to bear on campus, by protesting the firing of three UW professors accused of communist affiliations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kindig |first1=Jessie |title=Student Activism at UW, 1948–1970 |url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_student.shtml |access-date=February 13, 2021 |publisher=UW Civil Rights and Labor History Consortium |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514024128/http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_student.shtml |archive-date=May 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=McBride |first1=Devon |title=The long history of activism at the UW |url=https://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_0414cc26-439e-11e9-8efb-f353659ce7d7.html |access-date=February 13, 2021 |publisher=The Daily |date=March 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328145032/https://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_0414cc26-439e-11e9-8efb-f353659ce7d7.html |archive-date=March 28, 2019}}</ref>

====Housing====
{{Main|Housing at the University of Washington}}
The university operates one of the largest campuses of any higher education institution in the world. Despite this, growing faculty and student count has strained the regional housing supply as well as transportation facilities. Starting in 2012, UW began taking active measures to explore, plan and enact a series of campus policies to manage the annual growth. In addition to new buildings, parking and [[light rail]] stations, new building construction and renovations have been scheduled to take place through 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpd.uw.edu/campus-master-plan|title=Campus Master Plan {{!}} Capital Planning and Development|website=cpd.uw.edu|language=en|access-date=August 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802040435/https://cpd.uw.edu/campus-master-plan|archive-date=August 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The plan includes the construction of three six-story [[residence hall]]s and two apartment complexes in the west section of campus, near the existing [[Terry and Lander Halls]], in Phase I, the renovation of six existing residence halls in Phase II, and additional new construction in Phase III. The projects will result in a net gain of approximately 2,400 beds. The Residence Hall Student Association (student government for the halls) is the second-largest student organization on campus and helps plan fun events in the halls. For students, faculty, and staff looking to live off-campus, they may also explore Off-Campus Housing Affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://housing.asuw.org/|title=Off-Campus Housing Affairs |publisher=ASUW |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215084410/http://housing.asuw.org/|archive-date=December 15, 2004}}</ref>

The Greek System at UW has also been a prominent part of student culture for more than 115 years. It is made up of two organizational bodies, the [[Interfraternity Council]] (IFC) and the Panhellenic Association.  The IFC looks over 34 fraternities with 1900+ members and Panhellenic consists of 19 sororities and 1900 members. The school has additional Greek organizations that do not offer housing and are primarily special interest.

====Disability resources====
In addition to the University of Washington's Disability Resources for Students (DRS) office, there is also a campus-wide [[The DO-IT Center|DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center]] program that assists educational institutions to fully integrate all students, including those with disabilities, into academic life. DO-IT includes a variety of initiatives, such as the [[DO-IT Scholars Program]], and provides information on the 'universal' design of educational facilities for students of all levels of physical and mental ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Programs/ud.html|title=Universal Design: Process, Principles, and Applications|date=June 14, 2012|publisher=Washington.edu|access-date=June 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428030609/http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Programs/ud.html|archive-date=April 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> These design programs aim to reduce systemic barriers which could otherwise hinder the performance of some students, and may also be applied to other professional organizations and conferences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/CUDE/app_project.html|title=Applications of Universal Design to Projects, Conference Exhibits, Presentations, and Professional Organizations|publisher=Washington.edu|access-date=June 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531051627/http://www.washington.edu/doit/CUDE/app_project.html|archive-date=May 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Athletics==
{{Main|Washington Huskies}}
UW students, sports teams, and alumni are called [[Washington Huskies]], and often referred to [[Metonymy|metonymically]] as "Montlake," due to the campus's location on Montlake Boulevard N.E.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/thiel/300600_thiel22.html|title=Mora's move generates intrigue|last1=Thiel|first1=Art|date=January 21, 2007|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|access-date=September 16, 2010}}</ref> (although the traditional bounds of the [[Montlake, Seattle, Washington|Montlake neighborhood]] do not extend north of the [[Montlake Cut]] to include the campus.) The [[husky]] was selected as the school mascot by the student committee in 1922, which replaced the "Sun Dodger", an abstract reference to the [[Seattle, Washington#Climate|local weather]].

The university participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s Division I-A, and the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. The [[Washington Huskies football|football team]] is traditionally competitive, having won the 1960 and 1991 national title, to go along with eight [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] victories and an [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] title. From 1907 to 1917, Washington football teams were unbeaten in 64 consecutive games, an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] record.<ref name="unbeaten">{{cite web |url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2014/fbs.pdf |title=2014 NCAA Football Record Book |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |page=117 |access-date=October 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006070611/http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2014/FBS.pdf |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Tailgate party|Tailgating]] by boat has been a Husky Stadium tradition since 1920 when the stadium was first built on the shores of [[Lake Washington]]. The [[Apple Cup]] game is an annual game against cross-state rival [[Washington State University]] that was first contested in 1900 with UW leading the all-time series, 65 wins to 31 losses and 6 ties. [[College Football Hall of Fame]] member [[Don James (American football)|Don James]] is a former head coach.

[[File:Hec Ed.JPG|thumb|The [[Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion|Hec Edmundson Pavilion]] hosts basketball and volleyball events.]]

The men's [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|basketball]] team has been moderately successful, though recently the team has enjoyed a resurgence under coach [[Lorenzo Romar]]. With Romar as head coach, the team has been to six [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournaments]] (2003–2004, 2004–2005, 2005–2006, 2008–2009, 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 seasons), 2 consecutive top 16 (sweet sixteen) appearances, and secured a No. 1 seed in 2005. On December 23, 2005, the men's basketball team won their 800th victory in Hec Edmundson Pavilion, the most wins for any NCAA team in its current arena.

[[College rowing (United States)|Rowing]] is a longstanding tradition at the University of Washington dating back to 1901. The Washington men's crew gained international prominence by winning the [[gold medal]] at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin, defeating the German and Italian crews much to the dismay of [[Adolf Hitler]] who was in attendance.<ref>{{cite news|last=Raley|first=Dan|title=Events of the century|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/article/Events-of-the-century-3835569.php|access-date=October 8, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Post Intelligencer|date=December 21, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103161427/http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/article/Events-of-the-century-3835569.php|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1958, the men's crew deepened their legend with a shocking win over [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] Trud's world champion rowers at the Moscow Cup, resulting in the first American sporting victory on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soil,<ref>{{cite news|last=Johns|first=Greg|title=Huskies crew earns return trip to Moscow|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Huskies-crew-earns-return-trip-to-Moscow-1247561.php|access-date=July 7, 2012|newspaper=Seattle PI|date=August 23, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103170939/http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Huskies-crew-earns-return-trip-to-Moscow-1247561.php|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Thiel|first=Art|title=UW crew gets front seat to history|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/UW-crew-gets-front-seat-to-history-1248665.php#page-2|access-date=July 7, 2012|newspaper=Seattle PI|date=September 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103163953/http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/UW-crew-gets-front-seat-to-history-1248665.php#page-2|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and certainly the first time a Russian crowd gave any American team a standing ovation during the [[Cold War]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/washington/water_world/ Water World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925103138/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/washington/water_world/ |date=September 25, 2005 }}, ''Sports Illustrated'', November 17, 2003.</ref> The men's crew have won 46 national titles<ref name="RowingSuccessful">{{cite news|last=Raley|first=Dan|title=Crew: UW's most successful, stable athletic enterprise|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Crew-UW-s-most-successful-stable-athletic-1113687.php|access-date=July 7, 2012|newspaper=Seattle PI|date=April 30, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103170129/http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Crew-UW-s-most-successful-stable-athletic-1113687.php|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> (15 [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], 1 [[National Collegiate Rowing Championship]]), 15 Olympic gold medals, two silver and five bronze.

Recent national champions include the [[Washington Huskies softball|softball]] team ([[2009 Women's College World Series|2009]]), the men's rowing team (2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2009, 2007), NCAA Division I women's [[Cross country running|cross country]] team (2008), and the women's volleyball team ([[2005 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2005]]). Individually, Scott Roth was the 2011 NCAA men's Outdoor [[Pole Vault]] and 2011 & 2010 NCAA men's Indoor Pole Vault champion. [[James Lepp]] was the 2005 NCAA men's golf champion. Ryan Brown (men's 800 meters) and Amy Lia (women's 1500 meters) won individual titles at the 2006 NCAA Track and Field Championships. [[Brad Walker (athlete)|Brad Walker]] was the 2005 NCAA men's Outdoor and Indoor Pole Vault champion.

The university has an extensive series of sports facilities, including but not limited to the [[Husky Stadium]] (football, track and field), the [[Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion]] (basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics), [[Husky Ballpark]] (baseball), Husky Softball Stadium, The [[William Quillian (athlete)|Bill Quillian Tennis Stadium]], The [[Nordstrom]] Tennis Center, Dempsey Indoor (Indoor track and field, football) and the [[Conibear Shellhouse]] (rowing). The golf team plays at the Washington National Golf Club and until recently, the swimming team called the [[Weyerhaeuser]] Aquatic Center and the Husky pool home. The university discontinued its men's and women's swim teams on May 1, 2009, due to budget cuts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/sports/2009157966_budgetcuts02.html|title=Huskies &#124; UW cuts swimming teams &#124; Seattle Times Newspaper|last=Condotta|first=Bob|date=May 2, 2009|publisher=Seattletimes.com|access-date=January 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105161833/http://seattletimes.com/html/sports/2009157966_budgetcuts02.html|archive-date=November 5, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Husky Stadium===
[[File:Husky Stadium - March 19, 2016.jpg|thumb|The rebuilt [[Husky Stadium]], in 2016.]]
{{Main|Husky Stadium}}
The rebuilt Husky Stadium is the first and primary source of income for the completely remodeled athletic district. The major remodel consisted of a new grand concourse, [[University of Washington station|underground light-rail station]] which opened on March 19, 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/university-link-light-rail-service-starts-march-19/|title=University Link light-rail service starts March 19|date=January 26, 2016|website=The Seattle Times|access-date=May 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713045342/http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/university-link-light-rail-service-starts-march-19/|archive-date=July 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> an enclosed west end design, replacement of bleachers with individual seating, removal of track and Huskytron, as well as the installation of a new press box section, private box seating, football offices, permanent seating in the east end zone that does not block the view of Lake Washington. The project also included new and improved amenities, concession stands, and bathrooms throughout. The cost for renovating the stadium was around $280 million and was designed for a slightly lower [[seating capacity]] than its previous design, now at 70,138 seats.

Besides hosting national and regional football games, the Husky Stadium is also used by the university for its annual Commencement event, departmental ceremonies, and other events. Husky Stadium is one of several places that may have been the birthplace of the crowd phenomenon known as "[[Audience wave|The Wave]]". It is claimed that the wave was invented by Husky graduate Robb Weller and UW band director Bill Bissel in October 1981, for an afternoon game facing opponents from [[Stanford University]].

===School songs===
The [[University of Washington Husky Marching Band]] performs at many Husky sporting events including all [[American football|football]] games. The band was founded in 1929, and today it is a cornerstone of Husky spirit. The band marches using a traditional high step, and it is one of only a few marching bands left in the United States to do so. Like many college bands, the Husky band has several traditional songs that it has played for decades, including the official [[fight song]]s "[[Bow Down to Washington]]" and "[[Tequila (Champs song)|Tequila]]", as well as fan-favorite "Africano".
