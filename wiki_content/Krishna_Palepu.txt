===Books===
;''Winning in Emerging Markets''
In ''[[Winning in Emerging Markets (book by Tarun Khanna and Krishna Palepu)|Winning in Emerging Markets]]'', released in 2010, [[Tarun Khanna]] and Krishna Palepu outline a practical framework for developing emerging market strategies based not on broad categorical definitions like geography, but on a structural understanding of these markets. Their framework describes how “institutional voids” – the absence of intermediaries like market research firms and credit card systems to efficiently connect buyers and sellers – create daunting obstacles for companies trying to operate in emerging markets. Understanding these voids – and learning how to work with them in specific markets – is the key to success.<ref name="winninin"/>
