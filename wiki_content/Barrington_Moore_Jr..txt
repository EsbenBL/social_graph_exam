===''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy''===
{{Main article |Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy}}
Moore's groundbreaking work ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'' (1966) was the cornerstone to what is now called [[comparative historical analysis]] in the social sciences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gerschewski|first=Johannes|date=2021|title=Explanations of Institutional Change: Reflecting on a “Missing Diagonal”|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/explanations-of-institutional-change-reflecting-on-a-missing-diagonal/781D6F3867B4A20CBDED2CF9E2AF643B|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=|pages=1–16|doi=10.1017/S0003055420000751|issn=0003-0554|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> 

Moore's concern was the transformation of pre-industrial agrarian social relations into "modern" ones. He highlighted what he called "three routes to the modern world" - the liberal democratic, the fascist, and the communist - each deriving from the timing of industrialization and the social structure at the time of transition.

He drew particular attention to the violence which preceded the development of democratic institutions.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Munck|first=Gerardo L.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Passion_Craft_and_Method_in_Comparative.html?id=itGOAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description|title=Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics|last2=Snyder|first2=Richard|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8464-1|pages=17|language=en}}</ref> Initially, Moore set out to study a large number of countries, but reduced his number of cases to eight.<ref name=":2" />

===On tolerance===
In 1965, Moore, Herbert Marcuse, and [[Robert Paul Wolff]] each authored an essay on the concept of [[Toleration|tolerance]] and the three essays were collected in the book ''[[A Critique of Pure Tolerance]]''. The title was a play on the title of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s book ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In the book Moore argues that academic research and society in general should adopt a strictly [[scientific]] and [[secular]] outlook and approach theories and conjectures with empirical verification.<ref>Moore, Barrington, [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Robert Paul Wolff]], ''A Critique of Pure Tolerance'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1965)</ref>

==Personal life==
While working at the OSS, he met [[Herbert Marcuse]], a lifelong friend, and also his future wife, Elizabeth Ito, at the OSS.  His wife died in 1992. They had no children.
