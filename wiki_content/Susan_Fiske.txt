Her theoretical contributions include the development of the stereotype content model, ambivalent sexism theory, power as control theory, and the continuum model of impression formation.

==Early years and personal life==
Fiske comes from a family of psychologists and social activists. Her father, [[Donald W. Fiske]], was an influential psychologist who spent most of his career at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name=Chicago>{{cite web|title=Donald W.

She currently resides in Princeton, New Jersey with her husband [[Douglas Massey]], a Princeton sociologist.<ref name="Susan Fiske"/>

== Career ==
The last semester of Fiske's senior year, she worked with [[Shelley Taylor]], an assistant professor at Harvard, studying [[social cognition]], particularly the effect [[attention]] has in [[social situation]]s.<ref name="Susan Fiske"/> After graduation, Fiske continued in the field of social cognition. There is conflict between the fields of [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive psychology]], and some researchers want to keep these two fields separate. Fiske felt that significant knowledge could be attained by combining the fields. Fiske's experience with this conflict and her interest in the field of social cognition resulted in Fiske's and Taylor's book ''Social Cognition''. This book provides an overview of the developing theories and concepts emerging in the field of social cognition, while explaining the use cognitive processes to understand social situations, ourselves and others.<ref name="Susan Fiske"/> Fiske and [[Steven Neuberg]] went on to develop the first dual process model of social cognition, the "continuum model."

She gave expert testimony in the landmark case, ''[[Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins]]'' which was eventually heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fiske | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Bersoff | first2 = D.

This testimony led to a continuing interest in the use of psychological science in legal contexts.<ref>Borgida, E., & Fiske, S. T. (Eds.) (2008). Beyond common sense: Psychological science in the courtroom. New York: Wiley-Blackwell.</ref>

Working with Peter Glick, Fiske analyzed the dependence of male-female interactions, leading to the development of [[ambivalent sexism]] theory. She also examined gender differences in social psychologists' publication rates and citations within the influential psychology journal, ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]].'' The male authors in the sample submitted more articles and had higher acceptance rates (18% vs. 14%). Women's impact was the same as men's as measured through the number of citations in textbooks and handbooks, so women were more cited per article published.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cikara | first1 = M. | last2 = Rudman | first2 = L. | last3 = Fiske | first3 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Dearth by a thousand cuts?: Accounting for gender differences in top‐ranked publication rates in social psychology | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 263–285 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.2012.01748.x | pmid = 24748688 | pmc = 3991494 }}</ref>

Fiske worked with Peter Glick and [[Amy Cuddy]] to develop the Stereotype Content Model.<ref name="Susan Fiske"/> This model explains that warmth and competence differentiate out group stereotypes.

Fiske has been involved in the field of social cognitive neuroscience.<ref name="Susan Fiske"/> This field examines how neural systems are involved in social processes, such as person perception.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ochsner | first1 = K.

===Stereotype content model===
The [[stereotype content model]] (SCM) is a [[psychological]] theory arguing that people tend to perceive social groups along two fundamental dimensions: warmth and competence.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Fiske|first=Susan T.|date=2018-02-28|title=Stereotype Content: Warmth and Competence Endure|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=27|issue=2|pages=67–73|doi=10.1177/0963721417738825|pmid=29755213|pmc=5945217|issn=0963-7214}}</ref> Warmth describes the group's perceived intent (friendly and trustworthy or not); competence describes their perceived ability to act on their intent.<ref name=":4" /> The SCM was originally developed to understand the social classification of groups within the population of the U.S. However, the SCM has since been applied to analyzing social classes and structures across countries<ref name="journey" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Durante|first1=Federica|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|last3=Gelfand|first3=Michele J.|last4=Crippa|first4=Franca|last5=Suttora|first5=Chiara|last6=Stillwell|first6=Amelia|last7=Asbrock|first7=Frank|last8=Aycan|first8=Zeynep|last9=Bye|first9=Hege H.|date=2017-01-09|title=Ambivalent stereotypes link to peace, conflict, and inequality across 38 nations|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=114|issue=4|pages=669–674|doi=10.1073/pnas.1611874114|pmid=28069955|pmc=5278477|issn=0027-8424|doi-access=free}}</ref> and history.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Durante|first1=Federica|last2=Volpato|first2=Chiara|last3=Fiske|first3=Susan T.|date=2009|title=Using the stereotype content model to examine group depictions in Fascism: An archival approach|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=n/a|doi=10.1002/ejsp.637|pmid=24403646|pmc=3882081|issn=0046-2772}}</ref>

Most samples view their own middle class as both warm and competent, but they view refugees, homeless people, and undocumented immigrants as neither warm nor competent. The SCM's innovation is identifying mixed stereotypes—high on competence but low on warmth (e.g., rich people) or high on warmth but low on competence (e.g., elderly people).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Durante|first1=Federica|last2=Tablante|first2=Courtney Bearns|last3=Fiske|first3=Susan T.|date=March 2017|title=Poor but Warm, Rich but Cold (and Competent): Social Classes in the Stereotype Content Model|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=73|issue=1|pages=138–157|doi=10.1111/josi.12208|issn=0022-4537}}</ref> Nations with higher income inequality tend to use these mixed stereotypes more frequently.<ref name=":5" />

Groups’ perceived cooperativeness predicts their perceived warmth, and this dimension reflects the importance of intent.<ref name=":2" /> Warmth predicts active helping and harming.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Cuddy|first1=Amy J.

===Ambivalent sexism theory===
Fiske and Peter Glick developed the [[ambivalent Sexism|ambivalent sexism]] inventory (ASI) as a way of understanding prejudice against women.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | last1 = Glick | first1 = P. | last2 = Fiske | first2 = S. T. | year = 1996 | title = The ambivalent sexism inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 491–512 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.491| citeseerx = 10.1.1.470.9865 }}</ref> The ASI posits two sub-components of gender stereotyping: hostile sexism (hostility towards nontraditional women), and benevolent sexism (idealizing and protecting traditional women). The theory posits that men and women's intimate interdependence, coupled with men's average status advantage, requires incentives for women to cooperate (benevolent sexism) and punishment for women who resist (hostile sexism).<ref>{{Citation|last1=Glick|first1=Peter|title=Ambivalent sexism|date=2001|work=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology Volume 33|pages=115–188|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780120152339|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(01)80005-8}}</ref> Both men and women can endorse hostile sexism and benevolent sexism, though men on average score higher than women, especially on hostile sexism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Glick|first1=Peter|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|date=2001|title=An ambivalent alliance: Hostile and benevolent sexism as complementary justifications for gender inequality.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=56|issue=2|pages=109–118|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.56.2.109|pmid=11279804|issn=0003-066X}}</ref> The ASI appears useful across nations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Glick|first1=Peter|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|last3=Mladinic|first3=Antonio|last4=Saiz|first4=José L.|last5=Abrams|first5=Dominic|last6=Masser|first6=Barbara|last7=Adetoun|first7=Bolanle|last8=Osagie|first8=Johnstone E.|last9=Akande|first9=Adebowale|date=2000|title=Beyond prejudice as simple antipathy: Hostile and benevolent sexism across cultures.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=79|issue=5|pages=763–775|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.763|pmid=11079240|issn=0022-3514|hdl=11511/40492|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The authors have also developed a parallel scale of ambivalence toward men.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Glick|first1=Peter|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|date=1999|title=The Ambivalence Toward Men Inventory|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=23|issue=3|pages=519–536|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1999.tb00379.x|s2cid=145242896|issn=0361-6843}}</ref>

===Power-as-control theory===
Power-as-control theory aims to explain how social power motivates people to heed or ignore others. In this framework, power is defined as control over valued resources and over others' outcomes. Low-power individuals attend to those who control resources, while powerful people need not attend to low-power individuals (since high-power individuals can, by definition, get what they want).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fiske | first1 = S. T. | year = 1993 | title = Controlling other people: The impact of power on stereotyping | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 48 | issue = 6| pages = 621–628 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.48.6.621 | pmid = 8328729 }}</ref>

===Continuum model of impression formation===
This model describes the process by which we form impressions of others. Impression formation is framed as depending on two factors: The available information and the perceiver's motivations.<ref>Fiske, S. T., Lin, M., & Neuberg, S. L. (1999). The continuum model. In S. Chaiken & Y. Trope (Eds.), Dual-Process Theories in Social Psychology. Guilford Press.</ref> According to the model, these two factors help to explain people's tendency to apply stereotyping processes vs. individuating processes when forming social impressions.

==Response to 'replication crisis'==
With the [[Replication crisis|replication crisis of psychology]] earning attention, Fiske drew controversy for calling out critics of psychology.<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/susan-fiske-methodological-terrorism-2016-9?r=US&IR=T|title=Scientists are furious after a famous psychologist accused her peers of 'methodological terrorism'|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/draft-of-observer-column-sparks-strong-social-media-response.html|title=Draft of Observer Column Sparks Strong Social Media Response|work=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref><ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/10/inside-psychologys-methodological-terrorism-debate.html|title=Inside Psychology's 'Methodological Terrorism' Debate|last=Singal|first=Jesse|work=Science of Us|access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref> In a letter intended for publication in ''APS Observer,'' she referred to these unnamed "adversaries" as "methodological terrorist" and "self-appointed data police", and said that criticism of psychology should only be expressed in private or through contacting the journals.<ref name=":12" /> Columbia University statistician and political scientist [[Andrew Gelman]], "well-respected among the researchers driving the replication debate", responded to Fiske, saying that she had found herself willing to tolerate the "dead paradigm" of faulty statistics and had refused to retract publications even when errors were pointed out.<ref name=":12" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://andrewgelman.com/2017/10/04/breaking-pnas-changes-slogan/|title=BREAKING . . . . . . .

She elaborated: "In a few rare but chilling cases, self-appointed data police are volunteering critiques" that "attack the person, not just the work; they attack publicly, without quality controls; they have reportedly sent their unsolicited, unvetted attacks to tenure-review committees and public-speaking sponsors; they have implicated targets' family members and advisors."<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=Fiske|first=APS Past President Susan T.|date=2016-10-31|title=A Call to Change Science's Culture of Shaming|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/a-call-to-change-sciences-culture-of-shaming|journal=APS Observer|volume=29|issue=9}}</ref> Since writing the column, Fiske has published peer-reviewed advice about publishing rigorous research in the 21st century<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fiske|first=Susan T.|date=2016|title=How to publish rigorous experiments in the 21st century|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=66|pages=145–147|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2016.01.006|pmid=30555180|pmc=6294447|issn=0022-1031}}</ref> and about adversarial collaboration as a remedy to public incivility among disagreeing perspectives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fiske|first=Susan T.|date=2017|title=Going in Many Right Directions, All at Once|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=4|pages=652–655|doi=10.1177/1745691617706506|pmid=28727963|pmc=5520646|issn=1745-6916}}</ref>
