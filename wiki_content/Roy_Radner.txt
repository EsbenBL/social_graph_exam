== Radner equilibrium ==
Among Radner's various contributions, the one that bears his name, [[Radner equilibrium]] (1968), is a model of [[financial markets]].<ref>Radner (Jan. 1968) "Competitive Equilibrium under Uncertainty", Econometrica, pp. 31-58. [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~rradner/publishedpapers/20CompetitiveEquilibrium.pdf]</ref><ref>Chiaki Hara (2006) "General Equilibrium Theory: Lecture Note,"  Kyoto University. {{cite web |url=http://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hara/GET_01.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 14, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014175233/http://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hara/GET_01.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2006 }}</ref><ref>Magill and [[Martine Quinzii|Quinzii]] (2002) "Theory of incomplete markets. 1," MIT Press.</ref> In the traditional approach if the value of an asset or a contingent claim is affordable then it can be achieved. Not so with incomplete market as the payoff has to be replicable by trading of available assets that are now part of the definition of the economy. The first consequence of such a requirement is that budget sets do not fill the available space and are typically smaller than hyperplanes. Because the dimension of vectors orthogonal to the budget set is larger than one there is no reason for the  price systems supporting an equilibrium to be unique up to scaling, likewise the first order conditions no longer implies that  gradient of agents are collinear at equilibrium. Both happen to fail to hold generically: the [[first theorem of welfare economics]] is hence the first victim of incompleteness. [[Pareto-optimality]] of [[General equilibrium theory|equilibria]] generally does not hold.<ref>Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1985) "Existence, Regularity, and Constrained Suboptimality of Competitive Allocations When the Asset Market Is Incomplete." [https://ideas.repec.org/p/cwl/cwldpp/764.html]</ref> In traditional complete markets any policy would be undone through trading of rational expectation agents. This is no longer the case with incomplete markets as such policy-neutralising trading is no longer necessarily possible. Various policies (tax-related,<ref>John Geanakoplos and H. M. Polemarchakis (2008) "Pareto improving taxes," [http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d16b/d1662.pdf]</ref> monetary,<ref>Drèze, J.H. and Polemarchakis, H. (2001).

Additionally incompleteness opens the door for a theory of financial innovation with real impact.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ronel |last=Elul |year=1995 |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=43–78 |title=Welfare Effects of Financial Innovation in Incomplete Markets Economies with Several Consumption Goods |doi=10.1006/jeth.1995.1002 }}</ref> This was not possible in the traditional complete market general equilibrium model as any contingent claim could be replicated by trading and financial innovation would have no real effect.
