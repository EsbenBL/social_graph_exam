==Life and career==

Wuthnow was born in [[Kansas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catholicbooksreview.org/2012/wutnow.htm|title = Catholic Books Review: Robert WUTHNOW. Red State Religion}}</ref> on June 23, 1946. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at the [[University of Kansas]] in 1968 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in sociology at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1975. His dissertation was ''Consciousness and the Transformation of Society''. While at Berkeley, Wuthnow worked closely with [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]], [[Neil Smelser]], [[Robert Neelly Bellah|Robert Bellah]], Guy Swanson, and Gertrude Selznick. Wuthnow's first years at Berkeley were during the widespread protests on campus around the US, which ultimately inspired his dissertation. Glock and Bellah received a grant to study the symbolic—especially the religious—dimensions of the counter-culture movement from the Institute for Religion and Social Change. This four-year project resulted in the edited volume ''The New Religious Consciousness'' in 1976. Wuthnow realized that the counter-culture movements were just the most prominent evidence of deeper changes in American culture and used data from the project to argue this in his dissertation, eventually published as ''The Consciousness Reformation'' in 1976.

After a couple years as an instructor at the University of Arizona from 1974 to 1976, when he took position as assistant professor of sociology at Princeton University where he is currently.
