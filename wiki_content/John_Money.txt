'''John William Money''' (8 July 1921 – 7 July 2006) was a New Zealand [[psychologist]], [[Sexology|sexologist]] and author known for his research into [[sexual identity]] and [[Sex determination and differentiation (human)|biology of gender]] and his conduct towards vulnerable patients. He was one of the first researchers to publish theories on the influence of societal constructs of [[gender]] on individual formation of [[gender identity]]. Money introduced the terms ''gender identity'', ''[[gender role]]'' and ''[[sexual orientation]]'' and popularised the term ''[[paraphilia]]''.<ref name="John Money, Ph.D" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRcWBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA45|title=Perverse Psychology: The pathologization of sexual violence and transgenderism|last=Tosh|first=Jemma|date=25 July 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317635444|language=en}}</ref> He spent a considerable amount of his career in the USA.

Money was a junior member of the psychology faculty at the [[University of Otago]] in Dunedin. Author [[Janet Frame]] attended some of Money's classes at the University of Otago as part of her teacher training. In October 1945, after Frame wrote an essay mentioning her thoughts of suicide,<ref name=Angel>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/6f1/frame-janet-paterson/print|title=Frame, Janet Paterson | first = Patrick | last = Evans | encyclopedia = Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand | year = 2010}}</ref> John Money facilitated Frame's committal to the psychiatric ward at Dunedin Public Hospital, leading to eight years in psychiatric institutions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkIoBgAAQBAJ|title=An Angel at My Table |last=Janet|first=Frame|publisher =Little, Brown Book Group | date = 2015 | isbn = 9780349006697}}</ref> In Frame's autobiography, ''An Angel at My Table'', Money is referred to as John Forrest.<ref name=Angel />

In 1947, at the age of 26, he emigrated to the United States to study at the Psychiatric Institute of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He left Pittsburgh and earned his PhD from [[Harvard University]] in 1952. He was married briefly in the 1950s but had no children.

Money proposed and developed several theories and related terminology, including [[gender identity]], [[gender role]],<ref name="diamond2">{{cite journal | last = Diamond | first = Milton | year = 2004 | title = Sex, gender, and identity over the years: a changing perspective | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 591–607 | pmid = 15183375 |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/historical/OverTheYears.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203153327/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/historical/OverTheYears.htm | archive-date=3 December 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2004.02.008 }}</ref> gender-identity/role and [[lovemap]]. He popularized the term ''paraphilia'' (appearing in the [[DSM-III]], which would later replace ''perversions'') and introduced the term ''sexual orientation'' in place of ''sexual preference'', arguing that attraction is not necessarily a matter of free choice.<ref name="John Money, Ph.D"/><ref name=":0" />

Money was a professor of [[pediatrics]] and [[medical psychology]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1951 until his death. He also established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965 along with [[Claude Migeon]] who was the head of pediatric endocrinology at Johns Hopkins. The hospital began performing sexual reassignment surgery in 1966.<ref name="The Journal of Sex Research">{{cite journal|last1=Bullough|first1=Vern|title=The Contributions of John Money: A Personal View| journal = The Journal of Sex Research |volume=40|issue=3|pages=230–236| publisher=Taylor and Francis, Ltd.|jstor=3813317|year=2003|doi=10.1080/00224490309552186|pmid=14533016|s2cid=22122271}}</ref> At Johns Hopkins, Money was also involved with the Sexual Behaviors Unit, which ran studies on [[sex-reassignment surgery]]. He received the [[Magnus Hirschfeld Medal]] in 2002 from the [[German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research]].

Money was also an early supporter of New Zealand's arts, both literary and visual. In 2002, as his [[Parkinson's disease]] worsened, Money donated a substantial portion of his art collection to the [[Eastern Southland Art Gallery]] in [[Gore, New Zealand]].<ref name="sunobit">{{cite news | last = Brewington | first = Kelly | date = 9 July 2006 |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-07-09/news/0607090031_1_gender-johns-hopkins-john-money | title = Dr. John Money 1921–2006: Hopkins pioneer in gender identity | work = [[Baltimore Sun]]}}</ref> In 2003, the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, opened the John Money wing at the Eastern Southland Gallery.<ref>{{Cite press release |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0312/S00341.htm|title=PM opens new wing at Eastern Southland Gallery | date = 12 December 2003 | author = Office of the Prime Minister |access-date=18 September 2017}}</ref>

{{further|Sexual identity|Gender identity|Gender role}}
Money introduced numerous definitions related to gender in journal articles in the 1950s, many of them as a result of his studies of hermaphroditism.

Money's definition of [[gender]] is based on his understanding of sex differences among human beings. According to Money, the fact that one sex produces [[ovum|ova]] and the other sex produces [[sperm]] is the irreducible criterion of sex difference. However, there are other ''sex-derivative differences'' that follow in the wake of this primary dichotomy.

These differences involve the way urine is expelled from the human body and other questions of [[sexual dimorphism]]. According to Money's theory, ''sex-adjunctive differences'' are typified by the smaller size of females and their problems in moving around while [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] infants. This then makes it more likely that the males do the roaming and hunting.

''Sex-arbitrary differences'' are those that are purely conventional: for example, color selection (baby blue for boys, [[Pink#The 20th century|pink for girls]]). Some of the latter differences apply to life activities, such as career opportunities for men versus women.

Finally, Money created the now-common term ''[[gender role]]'' which he differentiated from the concept of the more traditional terminology ''sex role''. This grew out of his studies of hermaphrodites. According to Money, the genitalia and erotic sexual roles were now, by his definition, to be included under the more general term "gender role" including all the non-genital and non-erotic activities that are defined by the conventions of society to apply to males or to females.

In his studies of hermaphrodites, Money found that there are six variables that define sex. While in the average person all six would line up unequivocally as either all "male" or "female", in hermaphrodites any one or more than one of these could be inconsistent with the others, leading to various kinds of anomalies. In his seminal 1955 paper he defined these factors as:<ref name=MHH-1955>{{cite journal |last1=Money |first1=John |author-link1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |pmid=13260820 }}</ref>
# assigned sex and sex of rearing
# external genital morphology
# internal reproductive structures
# hormonal and secondary sex characteristics
# gonadal sex
# chromosomal sex

and added, {{quote|"Patients showing various combinations and permutations of these six sexual variables may be appraised with respect to a seventh variable:
7. Gender role and orientation as male or female, established while growing up."<ref name=MHH-1955 />}}

He then defined gender role as {{quote|"all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively.  It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism.  Gender role is appraised in relation to the following:  general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor; play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices, and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry."<ref name=MHH-1955 />}}

Money made the concept of ''gender'' a broader, more inclusive concept than one of masculine/feminine. For him, gender included not only one's status as a man or a woman, but was also a matter of personal recognition, social assignment, or legal determination; not only on the basis of one's genitalia but also on the basis of somatic and behavioral criteria that go beyond genital differences.

In 1972, Money presented his theories in ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'', a college level textbook.The book featured David Reimer (see below) as an example of gender reassignment.

{{Confusing section|reason=there are terms in this section that require explanation as they are technical jargon used in Money's theoretical conceptualizing and do not have broad understanding|date=March 2016}}
In his book ''Gay, Straight and In-Between: The Sexology of Erotic Orientation'', Money develops a conception of "[[bodymind]]".<ref name=GayStraight-p116>Money 1988, p. 116.</ref> "Bodymind" is a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between [[nature versus nurture]], innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological. He suggested that all of these capitalize on the ancient, pre-Platonic, pre-biblical conception of body versus the mind, and the physical versus the spiritual. In coining the term "bodymind", in this sense, Money wishes to move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology.

Money also developed a view of "Concepts of Determinism" which, transcultural, transhistorical, and universal, all people have in common, sexologically or otherwise.<ref name=GayStraight-p114-119>Money 1988, pp. 114–119.</ref> These include pairbondage, troopbondage, abidance, ycleptance, foredoomance, with these coping strategies: adhibition (engagement), inhibition, explication.

Money suggested that the concept of "threshold"<ref name=GayStraight-p115>Money 1988, p. 115.</ref> – the release or inhibition of sexual (or other) behavior – is most useful for sex research as a substitute for any concept of motivation. Moreover, it confers the distinct advantage of having continuity and unity to what would otherwise be a highly disparate and varied field of research. It also allows for the classification of sexual behavior. For Money, the concept of threshold has great value because of the wide spectrum to which it applies. "It allows one to think developmentally or longitudinally, in terms of stages or experiences that are programmed serially, or hierarchically, or cybernetically (i.e. regulated by mutual feedback)."<ref name=GayStraight-p116 />

==Controversies==

===Sex reassignment of David Reimer===
{{Main|David Reimer}}During his professional life, Money was respected as an expert on sexual behavior, especially known for his views that gender was learned rather than innate. However, it was later revealed that his most famous case of [[David Reimer]], born Bruce Reimer, was fundamentally flawed.<ref name="Dr. Money And The Boy With No Penis">{{cite episode |url=https://www.documentarystorm.com/dr-money-and-the-boy-with-no-penis/ | title = Dr. Money and the Boy With No Penis | access-date = 24 December 2010 | series = Horizon | season = 41 | number = 8 | date = 4 November 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204095225/https://www.documentarystorm.com/dr-money-and-the-boy-with-no-penis/ |archive-date=2021-02-04}}</ref> In 1966, a botched [[circumcision]] left eight-month-old Reimer without a penis. Money persuaded the baby's parents that [[sex reassignment surgery]] would be in Reimer's best interest. At the age of 22 months, Reimer underwent an [[orchiectomy]], in which his testicles were surgically removed. He was reassigned to be raised as female and his name changed from Bruce to Brenda. Money further recommended hormone treatment, to which the parents agreed. Money then recommended a surgical procedure to create an artificial vagina, which the parents refused. Money published a number of papers reporting the reassignment as successful.

During subsequent appointments with Reimer and Reimer's twin brother Brian, Money forced the two to rehearse sexual acts, with David playing the bottom role as his brother "[pressed] his crotch against" David's buttocks. Money also forced the two children to strip for "genital inspections", occasionally taking photos. Money justified these criminal acts by claiming that "childhood 'sexual rehearsal play{{' "}} was important for a "healthy adult gender identity".{{sfn|Colapinto|2001b}}

For several years, Money reported on Reimer's progress as the "John/Joan case", describing apparently successful female gender development and using this case to support the feasibility of [[Sex reassignment therapy|sex reassignment]] and [[Sex reassignment surgery|surgical reconstruction]] even in non-[[intersex]] cases. Notes by a former student at Money's laboratory state that, during the yearly follow-up visits, Reimer's parents routinely lied to staff about the success of the procedure. Reimer's twin brother, Brian, later developed [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="bbc-horizon-tv-followup">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dr_money_prog_summary.shtml |title=Dr Money and the Boy with No Penis: An experiment on nature versus nurture goes tragically wrong |date=2005 |website=BBC |series=Science & Nature: TV & Radio Follow-up – Horizon |publisher=BBC |access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> At 14 years old and in extreme psychological agony, Reimer's parents told him the truth.

David Reimer's case came to international attention in 1997 when he told his story to [[Milton Diamond]], an academic [[sexology|sexologist]], who persuaded Reimer to allow him to report the outcome in order to dissuade physicians from treating other infants similarly.<ref name="PCSS">{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|author2=Sigmundson, HK|title=Sex reassignment at birth.

Money argued that media response to the exposé was due to right-wing [[media bias]] and "the antifeminist movement." He said his detractors believed "masculinity and femininity are built into the genes so women should get back to the mattress and the kitchen".<ref name="reason">[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (24 May 2004).

===Opinions on pedophilia===
John Money participated in debates on [[chronophilia]]s, especially [[pedophilia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Diederik|date=2017|title=John Money's "Chronophilia": Untimely Sex between Philias and Phylisms|url=http://www.sexual-offender-treatment.org/162.html|journal=Sexual Offender Treatment|volume=12|issue=1}}</ref> He stated that both sexual researchers and the public do not make distinctions between affectional pedophilia and [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadistic]] pedophilia. Money asserted that affectional pedophilia was about love and not sex.

{{quote|If I were to see the case of a boy aged ten or eleven who's intensely erotically attracted toward a man in his twenties or thirties, if the relationship is totally mutual, and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual [...] then I would not call it pathological in any way.<ref name="paidika">Interview: John Money.

Money held the view that affectional pedophilia is caused by a surplus of parental love that became erotic, and is not a behavioral disorder. Rather, he took the position that [[heterosexuality]] is another example of a societal and therefore superficial, ideological concept.<ref name="paidika"/><ref name="The True Story of John / Joan"/>

Researcher Mary Anne Case states that Money made "fraudulently deceptive claims about the malleability of gender in certain patients who had involuntarily undergone sex reassignment surgery" and that this fueled the [[anti-gender movement]].<ref name=Case>{{cite journal |last1=Case |first1=Mary Anne |title=Trans Formations in the Vatican's War on 'Gender Ideology' |journal=[[Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] |issn=0097-9740 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=13570&context=journal_articles |date=2019 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=639–664 |doi=10.1086/701498}}</ref>
