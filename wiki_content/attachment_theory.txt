'''Attachment theory''' is a [[psychological]], [[evolution]]ary and [[Ethology|ethological]] theory concerning [[interpersonal relationship|relationships between humans]]. The most important tenet is that young children need to develop a relationship with at least one primary caregiver for normal social and emotional development. The theory was formulated by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst [[John Bowlby]].<ref name="Cassidy">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1999 |title=The Nature of a Child's Ties |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York | veditors = Cassidy J, Shaver PR |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/3 3–20] |isbn=1572300876 | vauthors = Cassidy J |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/3 }}</ref>

Within attachment theory, infant behaviour associated with attachment is primarily the seeking of [[Wikt:proximity|proximity]] to an attachment figure in stressful situations. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with them, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the latter part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment; these, in turn, lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts and expectations in later relationships.<ref name="Bretherton/Mul">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1999 |title=Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York | veditors = Cassidy J, Shaver PR |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/89 89–114] |isbn=1572300876 |author=Bretherton I, Munholland KA |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/89 }}</ref> Separation anxiety or grief following the loss of an attachment figure is considered to be a normal and adaptive response for an attached infant.

Research by [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Mary Ainsworth]] in the 1960s and 70s underpinned the basic concepts, introduced the concept of the "secure base" and developed a theory of a number of attachment patterns in infants: secure attachment, avoidant attachment and anxious attachment.<ref name="Bretherton">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bretherton I |year=1992 |title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=759–775 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}</ref> A fourth pattern, disorganised attachment, was identified later.

To formulate a comprehensive theory of the nature of early attachments, Bowlby explored a range of fields, including [[evolutionary biology]], [[object relations theory]] (a school of [[psychoanalysis]]), [[systems theory|control systems theory]], and the fields of [[ethology]] and [[cognitive psychology]].<ref name="simpson">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1999 |title=Attachment Theory in Modern Evolutionary Perspective |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |veditors = Cassidy J, Shaver PR |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/115 115–40] |isbn=1572300876 |author=Simpson JA |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/115 }}</ref> After preliminary papers from 1958 onwards, Bowlby published the full theory in the trilogy ''Attachment and Loss'' (1969–82). In the early days of the theory, academic psychologists criticized Bowlby, and the psychoanalytic community ostracised him for his departure from psychoanalytical doctrines;<ref name="Rutter 95" /> however, attachment theory has since become the dominant approach to understanding early social development, and has given rise to a great surge of [[empirical research]] into the formation of children's close relationships.<ref name="Schaffer" /> Later criticisms of attachment theory relate to temperament, the complexity of social relationships, and the limitations of discrete patterns for classifications. Attachment theory has been significantly modified as a result of empirical research, but the concepts have become generally accepted.<ref name="Rutter 95" /> Attachment theory has formed the basis of new therapies and informed existing ones, and its concepts have been used in the formulation of social and childcare policies to support the early attachment relationships of children.<ref name="BZL" />

==Attachment==
[[Image:Mozambique024.jpg|thumb|alt=A young mother smiles up at the camera. On her back is her baby gazing at the camera with an expression of lively interest.|right|Although it is usual for the mother to be the primary attachment figure, infants will form attachments to any carer who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them.]]

Within attachment theory, ''attachment'' means an [[affectional bond]] or tie between an individual and an attachment figure (usually a caregiver). Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver, these bonds are based on the child's need for safety, security, and protection — paramount in infancy and childhood. The theory proposes that children attach to carers instinctively,<ref name="BrethQuote">{{cite news|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|quote=[Bowlby] begin by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like "fixed action patterns" to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be "goal-corrected" with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but – depending on the organism – can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies.}}</ref> for the purpose of survival and, ultimately, genetic replication.<ref name=pg15/> The biological aim is survival and the psychological aim is security.<ref name="Schaffer"/> Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist. In child-to-adult relationships, the child's tie is called the "attachment" and the caregiver's reciprocal equivalent is referred to as the "care-giving bond".<ref name=pg15>[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 15.</ref>

Infants will form attachments to ''any'' consistent caregiver who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. The quality of social engagement is more influential than the amount of time spent. The biological mother is the usual principal attachment figure, but the role can be taken by anyone who consistently behaves in a "mothering" way over a period of time. Within attachment theory, this means a set of behaviours that involves engaging in lively social interaction with the infant and responding readily to signals and approaches.<ref>Bowlby (1969) p. 365.</ref> Nothing in the theory suggests that fathers are not equally likely to become principal attachment figures if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction.<ref>[[#Holmes93|Holmes]] p. 69.</ref>

Some infants direct attachment behaviour (proximity seeking) towards more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top.<ref>Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. pp. 304–05.</ref> The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain a bond with an accessible and available attachment figure.<ref name=kobmad>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Kobak R, Madsen S|year=2008|title= Disruption in Attachment Bonds|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| veditors = Cassidy J, Shaver PR | publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=23–47|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> "Alarm" is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger. "Anxiety" is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure. If the figure is unavailable or unresponsive, separation distress occurs.<ref name="pg16">[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 16.</ref> In infants, physical separation can cause anxiety and anger, followed by sadness and despair. By age three or four, physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child's bond with the attachment figure. Threats to security in older children and adults arise from prolonged absence, breakdowns in communication, emotional unavailability or signs of rejection or abandonment.<ref name=kobmad/>

===Behaviours===
[[File:Kaitlyn reads a book..jpg|thumb|right|alt=A baby leans at a table staring at a picture book with intense concentration.| Insecure attachment patterns can compromise exploration and the achievement of self-confidence. A securely attached baby is free to concentrate on their environment.]]

The attachment behavioural system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=17}}

Pre-attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life. During the first phase (the first eight weeks), infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity.

During the second phase (two to six months), the infant discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. The infant's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}}

By the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened, and following when able.{{sfn|Karen|1998|pp=90–92}}

With the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a "safe base" from which to explore.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Disorders of childhood : development and psychopathology | first1 = Robin Hornik | last1 = Parritz | first2 = Michael F | last2 = Troy | name-list-style = vanc |date=2017-05-24 |isbn=9781337098113 |edition=Third |location=Boston, MA |oclc=960031712}}</ref>{{Rp|71}} Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore.

After the second year, as the child begins to see the caregiver as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|pp=19–20}} Children begin to notice others' goals and feelings and plan their actions accordingly.

===Tenets===
Modern attachment theory is based on three principles:<ref name=":9">{{cite book |title=Attachment Theory in Practice: Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) with Individuals, Couples and Families |last=Johnson |first=Susan M. | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=The Guildford Press |year=2019 |isbn=978-1462538287 |location=New York |pages=5}}</ref>  
# Bonding is an intrinsic human need. 
# Regulation of emotion and fear to enhance vitality.
# Promoting adaptiveness and growth. 
Common attachment behaviours and emotions, displayed in most social primates including humans, are [[Adaption|adaptive]]. The long-term evolution of these species has involved selection for social behaviors that make individual or group survival more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation and has similar advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|p=300}} There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone, or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure in the face of threat is the "set-goal" of the attachment behavioural system.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Bowlby's original account of a [[Critical period|sensitivity period]] during which attachments can form of between six months and two to three years has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

With further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the beginning, many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly toward one particular person. Bowlby used the term "monotropy" to describe this bias.{{sfn|Bowlby|1982|p=309}} Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean the relationship with the special figure differs ''qualitatively'' from that of other figures. Rather, current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships.<ref name="Rutter 95">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutter M | title = Clinical implications of attachment concepts: retrospect and prospect | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 549–71 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7650083 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x }}</ref><ref name="Main">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1999 |title=Epilogue: Attachment Theory: Eighteen Points with Suggestions for Future Studies |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |url= https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/845 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/845 845–87] |isbn=978-1-57230-087-3 |quote=although there is general agreement an infant or adult will have only a few attachment figures at most, many attachment theorists and researchers believe infants form 'attachment hierarchies' in which some figures are primary, others secondary, and so on.

Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others. This system, called the "internal working model of social relationships", continues to develop with time and experience.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|pp=39–40}}

Internal models regulate, interpret, and predict attachment-related behaviour in the self and the attachment figure. As they develop in line with environmental and developmental changes, they incorporate the capacity to reflect and communicate about past and future attachment relationships.<ref name="Bretherton/Mul"/> They enable the child to handle new types of social interactions; knowing, for example, an infant should be treated differently from an older child, or that interactions with teachers and parents share characteristics. This internal working model continues to develop through adulthood, helping cope with friendships, marriage, and parenthood, all of which involve different behaviours and feelings.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|pp=39–40}}<ref name="Bowlby 73">{{cite book |title=Separation: Anger and Anxiety | vauthors = Bowlby J |publisher=Hogarth |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-7126-6621-3 |series=Attachment and loss.

The development of attachment is a transactional process. Specific attachment behaviours begin with predictable, apparently innate, behaviours in infancy. They change with age in ways determined partly by experiences and partly by situational factors.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|pp=414–21}} As attachment behaviours change with age, they do so in ways shaped by relationships. A child's behaviour when reunited with a caregiver is determined not only by how the caregiver has treated the child before, but on the history of effects the child has had on the caregiver.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|pp=394–395}}<ref name="ainsworth 69">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ainsworth MD | title = Object relations, dependency, and attachment: a theoretical review of the infant-mother relationship | journal = Child Development | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 969–1025 | date = December 1969 | pmid = 5360395 | doi = 10.2307/1127008 | jstor = 1127008 }}</ref>

=== Cultural differences ===
In Western culture child-rearing, there is a focus on single attachment to primarily the mother. This dyadic model is not the only strategy of attachment producing a secure and emotionally adept child. Having a single, dependably responsive and sensitive caregiver (namely the mother) does not guarantee the ultimate success of the child. Results from Israeli, Dutch and east African studies show children with multiple caregivers grow up not only feeling secure, but developed "more enhanced capacities to view the world from multiple perspectives."<ref name=":12">{{cite book |title=Mothers and Others-The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding |last=Hrdy |first=Sarah Blaffer | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-674-03299-6 |location=United States of America |pages=130, 131, 132}}</ref> This evidence can be more readily found in hunter-gatherer communities, like those that exist in rural Tanzania.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Crittenden|first1=Alyssa N.|title=Cooperative Child Care among the Hadza: Situating Multiple Attachment in Evolutionary Context|date=2013|work=Attachment Reconsidered|pages=67–83|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-38674-8|last2=Marlowe|first2=Frank W.|doi=10.1057/9781137386724_3}}</ref>

In hunter-gatherer communities, in the past and present, mothers are the primary caregivers but share the maternal responsibility of ensuring the child's survival with a variety of different [[Allomothering|allomothers]]. So while the mother is important, she is not the only opportunity for relational attachment a child can make. Several group members (with or without blood relation) contribute to the task of bringing up a child, sharing the parenting role and therefore can be sources of multiple attachment. There is evidence of this communal parenting throughout history that "would have significant implications for the evolution of multiple attachment."<ref>{{cite book |title=Attachment Reconsidered: Cultural Perspectives on a Western Theory |last1=Quinn |first1=Naomi |last2=Mageo |first2=Jeannette Marie | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-137-38672-4 |location=United States of America |pages=73, 74}}</ref>

In "non-metropolis" India (where "dual income nuclear families" are more the norm and dyadic mother relationship is), where a family normally consists of 3 generations (and if lucky 4: great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, and child or children), the child or children by default have four to six caregivers from whom to select their "attachment figure". And a child's "uncles and aunts" (father's siblings and their spouses) also contribute to the child's psycho-social enrichment.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Although it has been debated for years, and there are small differences amongst cultures, research shows that the three basic aspects of Attachment Theory are universal.<ref name="IJzendoorn MH 2008. pp. 880">{{cite book | vauthors = Van Ijzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A | chapter = Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: Universal and contextual dimensions. | veditors = Cassidy J, Shaver PR | title = Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications. | edition = 2nd | location = New York, NY | publisher = Guilford Press | date = 2008 | pages = 880–905 }}</ref> The Hypotheses are: 1) that secure attachment is the most desirable state, and the most prevalent; 2) maternal sensitivity influences infant attachment patterns; and 3) specific infant attachments predict later social and cognitive competence.<ref name="IJzendoorn MH 2008. pp. 880" />

==Attachment patterns==

"The strength of a child's attachment behaviour in a given circumstance does not indicate the 'strength' of the attachment bond. Some insecure children will routinely display very pronounced attachment behaviours, while many secure children find that there is no great need to engage in either intense or frequent shows of attachment behaviour."<ref>Howe, D. (2011) Attachment across the lifecourse, London: Palgrave, p.13</ref> "Individuals with different attachment styles have different beliefs about romantic love period, availability, trust capability of love partners and love readiness."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Honari B, Saremi AA | year = 2015 | title = The Study of Relationship between Attachment Styles and Obsessive Love Style | journal = Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 165 | pages = 152–159 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.617 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Secure attachment===
{{Main|Secure attachment}}

A toddler who is securely attached to his or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.<ref>[[Daniel Schacter|Schacter, D.L.]] et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp.441</ref>

In the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as "Group B" infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4.<ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., & Wall, S.">{{cite book | vauthors = Ainsworth MD, Blehar MC, Waters E, Wall S | date = 1978 | title =  Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation. | location = Hillsdale, NJ | publisher = Earlbaum }}</ref> Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the comings and goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviors led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively "loose" terminology for these subgroups. B1's have been referred to as "secure-reserved", B2's as "secure-inhibited", B3's as "secure-balanced", and B4's as "secure-reactive". However, in academic publications the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply "B1" or "B2", although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology. Secure attachment is the most common type of attachment relationship seen throughout societies. <ref name="Ainsworth,1978a" />

Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child on how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.<ref name="Aronoff, J. 2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronoff J |year=2012 |title=Parental Nurturance in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: Theory, Coding, and Scores |journal=Cross-Cultural Research |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=315–347 |doi=10.1177/1069397112450851|s2cid=147304847 }}</ref>

===Anxious-ambivalent attachment===
Anxious-ambivalent attachment is also misnamed as "resistant attachment".<ref name="Ainsworth,1978a">{{cite book |title=Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation |vauthors=Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-89859-461-4 |location=Hillsdale NJ}}</ref> In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns.<ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., & Wall, S." /> The anxious-ambivalent strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant, C1) or helplessness (ambivalent passive, C2) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Solomon J, George C, De Jong A |year=1995 |title=Children classified as controlling at age six: Evidence of disorganized representational strategies and aggression at home and at school |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=447–463 |doi=10.1017/s0954579400006623}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Crittenden P | date = 1999 | chapter = Danger and development: the organization of self-protective strategies | title = Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk | veditors = Vondra JI, Barnett D | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell | pages = 145–171 }}</ref>

The C1 (ambivalent resistant) subtype is coded when "resistant behavior is particularly conspicuous. The mixture of seeking and yet resisting contact and interaction has an unmistakably angry quality and indeed an angry tone may characterize behavior in the preseparation episodes".<ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., & Wall, S." />

Regarding the C2 (ambivalent passive) subtype, Ainsworth et al. wrote:<blockquote>Perhaps the most conspicuous characteristic of C2 infants is their passivity. Their exploratory behavior is limited throughout the SS and their interactive behaviors are relatively lacking in active initiation. Nevertheless, in the reunion episodes they obviously want proximity to and contact with their mothers, even though they tend to use signalling rather than active approach, and protest against being put down rather than actively resisting release&nbsp;... In general the C2 baby is not as conspicuously angry as the C1 baby.<ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., & Wall, S." /></blockquote>Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999) found that children with abusive childhood experiences were more likely to develop ambivalent attachments. The study also found that children with ambivalent attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.<ref name="mccarthy1999avoidant">{{cite news |title=Avoidant/ambivalent attachment style as a mediator between abusive childhood experiences and adult relationship difficulties |last1=McCarthy |first1=Gerard |last2=Taylor |first2=Alan | name-list-style = vanc |work=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |year=1999 |issue=3 |volume=40 |pages=465–477 |doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00463 |ref=mccarthy1999avoidant}}</ref>

===Anxious-avoidant and dismissive-avoidant attachment===

An infant with an anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ainsworth MD, Bell SM | s2cid = 3942480 | title = Attachment, exploration, and separation: illustrated by the behavior of one-year-olds in a strange situation | journal = Child Development | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–67 | date = March 1970 | pmid = 5490680 | doi = 10.2307/1127388 | jstor = 1127388 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sroufe A, Waters E |year=1977 |title=Attachment as an Organizational Construct |journal=Child Development |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1184–1199 |citeseerx=10.1.1.598.3872 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1977.tb03922.x}}</ref>

Infants are depicted as anxious-avoidant when there is:<blockquote>...&nbsp;conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away&nbsp;... If there is a greeting when the mother enters, it tends to be a mere look or a smile&nbsp;... Either the baby does not approach his mother upon reunion, or they approach in "abortive" fashions with the baby going past the mother, or it tends to only occur after much coaxing&nbsp;... If picked up, the baby shows little or no contact-maintaining behavior; he tends not to cuddle in; he looks away and he may squirm to get down.<ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., & Wall, S." /></blockquote>
Ainsworth's narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The infant's needs were frequently not met and the infant had come to believe that communication of emotional needs had no influence on the caregiver.

Ainsworth's student [[Mary Main]] theorized that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situation Procedure should be regarded as "a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection" by de-emphasising attachment needs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Main M |year=1979 |title=The "ultimate" causation of some infant attachment phenomena |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=640–643 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00064992}}</ref>

Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ("disorganized distress"), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Main M | date = 1977 | chapter = Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some day-care children. | veditors = Webb R | title = Social Development in Childhood | pages = 33–78 | location = Baltimore | publisher = Johns Hopkins }}</ref>

==={{Anchor|disorganized attachment}}Disorganized/disoriented attachment===
Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed "tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be [[prodrome|prodromal]] to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through."<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S | date = 1978 | title = Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation | location = Hillsdale, NJ | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | page = 282 | isbn = 978-0-89859-461-4 }}</ref> Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress".<ref>{{cite thesis | vauthors = Crittenden PM | title = Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment | degree = Ph.D. | publisher = University of Virginia | date = May 1983 | page = 73 }}</ref>

Beginning in 1983, Crittenden offered A/C and other new organized classifications (see below). Drawing on records of behaviours discrepant with the A, B and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's colleague [[Mary Main]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention |last1=Main |first1=Mary |last2=Solomon |first2=Judith | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-30630-8 |editor-last=Greenberg |editor-first=Mark T. |location=Chicago |pages=121–60 |chapter=Procedures for Identifying Infants as Disorganized/Disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation |editor-last2=Cicchetti |editor-first2=Dante |editor-last3=Cummings |editor-first3=E. Mark |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHIfiCXE8EC&pg=PA121}}</ref> In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganized' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganized/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be more widely "recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior".<ref>Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Jean-Francois Bureau, M. Ann Easterbrooks, Ingrid Obsuth, Kate Hennighausen & Lauriane Vulliez-Coady (2013) Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal, Attachment & Human
Development, 15:5–6, 562–582</ref>

There is rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kochanska G, Kim S | title = Early attachment organization with both parents and future behavior problems: from infancy to middle childhood | journal = Child Development | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 283–96 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23005703 | pmc = 3530645 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01852.x }}</ref> However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Svanberg PO | date = 2009 | chapter = Promoting a secure attachment through early assessment and interventions. | veditors = Barlow J, Svanberg PO | title = Keeping the Baby in Min | pages = 100–114 | location = London | publisher = Routledge }}</ref> In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as "open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated as if they were the same thing.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Ainsworth M | date = 1990 | chapter = Epilogue | title = Attachment in the Preschool Years | veditors = Greenberg MT, Ciccheti D, Cummings EM | location = Chicago, IL | publisher = Chicago University Press | pages = 463–488 }}</ref> Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Solomon J, George C | date = 1999 | chapter = The place of disorganization in attachment theory. | veditors = Solomon J, George C | title = Attachment Disorganization | pages = 27 | location = NY | publisher = Guilford }}</ref>

Crittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent".<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Sroufe A, Egeland B, Carlson E, Collins WA | date = 2005 | title = The Development of the person: the Minnesota study of risk and adaptation from birth to adulthood | location = NY | publisher = Guilford Press | page = 245 }}</ref> However, "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response."<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Crittenden P | date = 1999 | chapter = Danger and development: the organization of self-protective strategies | title = Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk | veditors = Vondra JI, Barnett D | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell | pages = 159–160 }}</ref> For example, "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions.

=== Categorization differences across cultures ===
Across different cultures deviations from the Strange Situation Protocol have been observed.  A Japanese study in 1986 (Takahashi) studied 60 Japanese mother-infant pairs and compared them with Ainsworth's distributional pattern. Although the ranges for securely attached and insecurely attached had no significant differences in proportions, the Japanese insecure group consisted of only resistant children, with no children categorized as avoidant.  This may be because the Japanese child rearing philosophy stressed close mother infant bonds more so than in Western cultures.  In Northern Germany, Grossmann et al. (Grossmann, Huber, & Wartner, 1981; Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, & Unzner, 1985) replicated the Ainsworth Strange Situation with 46 mother infant pairs and found a different distribution of attachment classifications with a high number of avoidant infants: 52% avoidant, 34% secure, and 13% resistant (Grossmann et al., 1985).  Another study in Israel found there was a high frequency of an ambivalent pattern, which according to Grossman et al. (1985) could be attributed to a greater parental push toward children's independence.

=== Later patterns and the dynamic-maturational model ===
Techniques have been developed to allow verbal ascertainment of the child's state of mind with respect to attachment. An example is the "stem story", in which a child is given the beginning of a story that raises attachment issues and asked to complete it. For older children, adolescents and adults, semi-structured interviews are used in which the manner of relaying content may be as significant as the content itself.<ref name="Schaffer">{{cite book |title=Introducing Child Psychology | vauthors = Schaffer R |publisher=Blackwell |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-631-21628-5 |location=Oxford |pages=83–121}}</ref> However, there are no substantially validated measures of attachment for middle childhood or early adolescence (approximately 7 to 13 years of age).<ref name="AACAP-2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boris NW, Zeanah CH | title = Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 1206–19 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16239871 | doi = 10.1097/01.chi.0000177056.41655.ce | url = http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/rad.pdf | url-status = dead | access-date = September 13, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090824051123/http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/rad.pdf | others = Work Group on Quality Issues | archive-date = August 24, 2009 }}</ref>
Some studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behavior in infancy can develop into a child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organized, but the behaviour is treated by researchers as a form of 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organized according to parenting authority.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Main M, Cassidy J | date = 1988 | title = Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6. | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–426 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415 }}</ref>

American psychologist [[Patricia McKinsey Crittenden]] has elaborated classifications of further forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour, as seen in her model the [[Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation|Dynamic Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM)]]. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive compliance with the wishes of a threatening parent (A4).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Crittenden PM | date = 2008 | title = Raising Parents: Attachment, Parenting and Child Safety | location = London | publisher = Routledge }}</ref>

Crittenden's ideas developed from Bowlby's proposal that "given certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adulthood the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive".<ref>{{cite book | last = Bowlby |first =John |title=Loss: Sadness and depression|page=45 |year=1980 |place=New York|publisher=Basic Books|series = Attachment and Loss|volume = III|isbn =9780465042371}}</ref>

Crittenden proposed that the basic components of human experience of danger are two kinds of information:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Strathearn L, Fonagy P, Amico J, Montague PR | title = Adult attachment predicts maternal brain and oxytocin response to infant cues | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 34 | issue = 13 | pages = 2655–66 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19710635 | pmc = 3041266 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2009.103 }}</ref>

1. 'Affective information' – the emotions provoked by the potential for danger, such as anger or fear. Crittenden terms this "affective information". In childhood this information would include emotions provoked by the unexplained absence of an attachment figure. Where an infant is faced with insensitive or rejecting parenting, one strategy for maintaining the availability of their attachment figure is to try to exclude from consciousness or from expressed behaviour any emotional information that might result in rejection.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Andrea|first=Crittenden, Patricia McKinsey Landini|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/768809528|title=Assessing adult attachment : a dynamic-maturational approach to discourse analysis|date=2011|publisher=W.W Norton & Co|isbn=978-0-393-70667-3|oclc=768809528}}</ref>

2. Causal or other sequentially ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. If knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven is subject to segregation, then the infant can try to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Such behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety.<ref name="landa2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Landa S, Duschinsky R |s2cid=17508615 |title=Crittenden's dynamic–maturational model of attachment and adaptation |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=326–338 |year=2013 |doi=10.1037/a0032102 }}</ref>

Crittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure (See section above on Disorganized/disoriented attachment for distinction of "Types"): "Type A strategies were hypothesized to be based on reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Crittenden PM, Newman L | title = Comparing models of borderline personality disorder: Mothers' experience, self-protective strategies, and dispositional representations | journal = Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 433–51 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20603429 | doi = 10.1177/1359104510368209 | s2cid = 206707532 }}</ref> Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively utilise both kinds of information without much distortion.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Crittenden PM | title = Children's strategies for coping with adverse home environments: an interpretation using attachment theory | journal = Child Abuse & Neglect | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 329–43 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1617468 | doi = 10.1016/0145-2134(92)90043-q }}</ref> For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

===Significance of patterns===
Research based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care]] and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality. Lyons-Ruth, for example, found that "for each additional withdrawing behavior displayed by mothers in relation to their infant's attachment cues in the Strange Situation Procedure, the likelihood of clinical referral by service providers was increased by 50%."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons-Ruth K, Bureau JF, Easterbrooks MA, Obsuth I, Hennighausen K, Vulliez-Coady L | title = Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal | journal = Attachment & Human Development | volume = 15 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 562–82 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24299135 | pmc = 3861901 | doi = 10.1080/14616734.2013.841051 }}</ref>

There is an extensive body of research demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains.<ref name="PPP">{{cite book |title=Psychotherapy of abused and neglected children |vauthors=Pearce JW, Pezzot-Pearce TD |publisher=Guilford press |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-59385-213-9 |edition=2nd |location=New York and London |pages=17–20}}</ref> Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, but it is a liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood.{{sfn|Karen|1998|pp=248–66}} Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment.<ref name="Schaffer" /> Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function.<ref name="bercasapp">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=The Influence of Early Attachments on Other Relationships |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=333–47 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2 |vauthors=Berlin LJ, Cassidy J, Appleyard K |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR}}</ref> As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.<ref name="Schaffer" />

Studies have suggested that infants with a high-risk for [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haltigan JD, Ekas NV, Seifer R, Messinger DS | title = Attachment security in infants at-risk for autism spectrum disorders | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 41 | issue = 7 | pages = 962–7 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 20859669 | pmc = 4486071 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-010-1107-7 }}</ref> Behavioral problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting and the degree of risk in the family environment.<ref name=bercasapp/>

Some authors have questioned the idea that a [[wikt:taxonomy|taxonomy]] of categories representing a qualitative difference in attachment relationships can be developed.

There is some evidence that gender differences in attachment patterns of [[Adaption|adaptive]] significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. [[Adrenarche]] is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.<ref name="delguid">{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Giudice M | title = Sex, attachment, and the development of reproductive strategies | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–21; discussion 21–67 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19210806 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X09000016 | s2cid = 5396375 }}</ref>

==Changes in attachment during childhood and adolescence==
Childhood and adolescence allows the development of an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Age, cognitive growth, and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining.<ref name="Waters">{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters E, Kondo-Ikemura K, Posada G, Richters J |year=1991 |title=Learning to love: Mechanisms and milestones |journal=Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum |volume=23 |issue=Self–Processes and Development |veditors=Gunnar M, Sroufe T}}</ref> For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.<ref name="marbrit">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Normative Development: The Ontogeny of Attachment |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=269–94 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2 |vauthors=Marvin RS, Britner PA |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR}}</ref>

Ideally, these social skills become incorporated into the internal working model to be used with other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship.<ref name="Waters" /> By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual [[coregulation]] of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.<ref name="Waters" />

The attachment system used by adolescents is seen as a "safety regulating system" whose main function is to promote physical and psychological safety. There are 2 different events that can trigger the attachment system. Those triggers include, the presence of a potential danger or stress, internal and external, and a threat of accessibility and/or availability of an attachment figure. The ultimate goal of the attachment system is security, so during a time of danger or inaccessibility the behavioral system accepts felt security in the context of the availability of protection. By adolescence we are able to find security through a variety of things, such as food, exercise, and social media.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Kerns | first1 = Kathryn A. | first2 = Rhonda A. | last2 = Richardson | name-list-style = vanc | title = Attachment in Middle Childhood. | publisher = Guilford Press | date = 2005 }}</ref> Felt security can be achieved through a number of ways, and often without the physical presence of the attachment figure. Higher levels of maturity allows adolescent teens to more capably interact with their environment on their own because the environment is perceived as less threatening. Adolescents teens will also see an increase in cognitive, emotional and behavioral maturity that dictates whether or not teens are less likely to experience conditions that activate their need for an attachment figure. For example, when teenagers get sick and stay home from school, surely they want their parents to be home so they can take care of them, but they are also able to stay home by themselves without experiencing serious amounts of distress.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = McElhaney KB, Allen JP, Stephenson JC, Hare AL | chapter = Attachment and Autonomy During Adolescence | veditors = Lerner RM, Steinberg L | title = Part II: Domains of Individual Development in Adolescence | series = Handbook of Adolescent Psychology | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 30 October 2009 | doi = 10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy001012 | isbn = 978-0-470-47919-3 }}</ref>

* Secure adolescents are expected to hold their mothers at a higher rate than all other support figures, including father, significant others, and best friends.
* Insecure adolescents identify more strongly with their peers than their parents as their primary attachment figures. Their friends are seen as a significantly strong source of attachment support.
* Dismissing adolescents rate their parents as a less significant source of attachment support and would consider themselves as their primary attachment figure.

==Attachment styles in adults==
{{Main|Attachment in adults}}{{See also|Attachment measures}}
Attachment theory was extended to adult [[romantic relationship]]s in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hazan|first1=Cindy|last2=Shaver|first2=Phillip|date=1987|title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process.|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-21950-001|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=52|issue=3|pages=511–524|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511|pmid=3572722|via=APA PsycNet}}</ref> Four styles of attachment have been identified in adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}


'''Securely attached''' 

Securely attached adults have been “linked to a high need for achievement and a low fear of failure (Elliot & Reis, 2003)”. They will positively approach a task with the goal of mastering it and have an appetite for exploration in achievement settings (Elliot & Reis, 2003). Research shows that securely attached adults have a “low level of personal distress and high levels of concern for others”.<ref name="ams">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahmad S, Mohammad H, Shafique Z |date=2018 |title=The impact of attachment styles on helping behavior in adults |journal=Journal of Social Sciences and Humanity Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=24–29}}</ref> Due to their high rates of self-efficacy, securely attached adults typically do not hesitate to remove a person having a negative impact from problematic situations they are facing.<ref name="ams"/> This calm response is representative of the securely attached adult's emotionally regulated response to threats that many studies have supported in the face of diverse situations. Adult secure attachment comes from an individual's early connection with their caregiver(s), genes and their romantic experiences.<ref name="levine">{{cite book| vauthors = Levine A, Heller R |year=2011 |title=Attached: The new science of adult attachment and how it can help you find and keep love |location=New York, NY |publisher= Penguin Group}}</ref>

Within romantic relationships, a securely attached adult will appear in the following ways: excellent conflict resolution, mentally flexible, effective communicators, avoidance of manipulation, comfortable with closeness without fearfulness of being enmeshed, quickly forgiving, viewing sex and emotional intimacy as one, believing they can positively impact their relationship, and caring for their partner how they want to be cared for. In summation, they are great partners who treat their spouses very well, as they are not afraid to give positively and ask for their needs to be met. Securely attached adults believe that there are “many potential partners that would be responsive to their needs”, and if they come across an individual who is not meeting their needs, they will typically lose interest very quickly. In a study comparing secure-secure and secure-various attachment style relationships, there was no fluctuation in positive relational functioning. However, in any combination of two partners with attachment styles outside of secure, the relationships showed high levels of negative relationship functioning. This research indicates that it only takes one securely attached partner within a romantic relationship to maintain healthy, emotional relationship functioning.<ref name="levine"/>

{{citation needed span|date=March 2020|text=Sexually, securely attached individuals are less likely to be involved in one-night stands or sexual activity outside of the primary relationship, and more likely to report mutual initiation and enjoyment of sex.}}


'''Anxious-preoccupied''' 

Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They tend to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. The anxiety that adults feel prevents the establishment of satisfactory defense exclusion. Thus, it is possible that individuals that have been anxiously attached to their attachment figure or figures have not been able to develop sufficient defenses against separation anxiety. Because of their lack of preparation these individuals will then overreact to the anticipation of separation or the actual separation from their attachment figure. The anxiety comes from an individual's intense and/or unstable relationship that leave the anxious or preoccupied individual relatively defenseless.<ref name="Sperling, Michael B. 1994">{{cite book | last1 = Sperling | first1 = Michael B. | first2 = William H. | last2 = Berman | name-list-style = vanc | title = Attachment in Adults: Clinical and Developmental Perspectives | publisher = Guilford Press | date = 1994 }}</ref> Adults with this attachment style tend to look way too far into things, whether that's a text message or a face-to-face conversation. Their thoughts and actions can lead to a painful cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies and even self-sabotage. They often seek a dismissive-avoidant partner.<ref>{{cite web | last = Rivera | first = Chelsea | name-list-style = vanc | title = Avoidant Attachment: The Advanced Guide. | work = Depression Alliance | date = 29 May 2018 | url = https://www.depressionalliance.org/avoidant-attachment/ }}</ref>



'''Dismissive-avoidant'''

Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with conflict by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Adults lack the interest of forming close relationships and maintaining emotional closeness with the people around them. They have a great amount of distrust in others but at the same time possess a positive model of self, they would prefer to invest in their own ego skills. Because of their distrust they cannot be convinced that other people have the ability to deliver emotional support. They try to create high levels of self-esteem by investing disproportionately in their abilities or accomplishments. These adults maintain their positive views of self, based on their personal achievements and competence rather than searching for and feeling acceptance from others. These adults will explicitly reject or minimize the importance of emotional attachment and passively avoid relationships when they feel as though they are becoming too close. They strive for self-reliance and independence. When it comes to the opinions of others about themselves, they are very indifferent and are relatively hesitant to positive feedback from their peers. Dismissive avoidance can also be explained as the result of defensive deactivation of the attachment system to avoid potential rejection, or genuine disregard for interpersonal closeness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carvallo | first1 = Mauricio | last2 = Gabriel | first2 = Shira | name-list-style = vanc | year = 2006 | title = No Man Is an Island: The Need to Belong and Dismissing Avoidant Attachment Style | journal = PsycEXTRA Dataset | volume =  32| issue = 5| pages = 697–709 | doi = 10.1037/e511092014-160 | pmid = 16702161 }}</ref>

{{citation needed span|date=March 2020|text=Dismissive-avoidant individuals tend to report activities reflecting low psychological intimacy (one-night sex, extra-dyadic sex, sex without love), as well as less enjoyment of physical contact. Research has demonstrated that for both sexes, insecure-ambivalent attachment was related to enjoyment of holding and caressing, but not of more clearly sexual behaviors.}}


'''Fearful-avoidant''' 

Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.<ref name="Hazan, Shaver, 1987"/><ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1990">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |s2cid=53487697 |year=1990 |title=Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=270–80 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270}}</ref><ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1994">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1994 |title=Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=5 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}</ref><ref name="BarthoHoro">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM | s2cid = 3547883 | title = Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–44 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1920064 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226 }}</ref>



'''Relationships involving people with  different attachment styles'''<br>

{{citation needed span|date=March 2020|text=Relationally, insecure individuals tend to be partnered with insecure individuals, and secure individuals with secure individuals. Insecure relationships tend to be enduring but less emotionally satisfying compared to the relationship(s) of two securely attached individuals.}}

Attachment styles are activated from the first date onwards and impact relationship dynamics and how a relationship ends. Secure attachment has been shown to allow for better conflict resolution in a relationship and for one's ability to exit an unsatisfying relationship compared to other attachment types.  Secure individuals' authentic high self-esteem and positive view of others allows for this as they are confident that they will find another relationship.  Secure attachment has also shown to allow for the successful processing of relational losses (e.g. death, rejection, infidelity, abandonment etc.)  Attachment has also been shown to impact caregiving behavior in relationships, too (Shaver & Cassidy, 2018).


'''Assessing and measuring attachment'''<br>

Two main aspects of adult attachment have been studied. The organization and stability of the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment.<ref name="Fraley, Shaver,2000">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraley RC, Shaver PR |year=2000 |title=Adult romantic attachment: Theoretical developments, emerging controversies, and unanswered questions |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=132–54 |citeseerx=10.1.1.471.8896 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.132|s2cid=15620444 }}</ref><ref name="Pietro">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pietromonaco PR, Barrett LF |s2cid=17413696 |year=2000 |title=The internal working models concept: What do we really know about the self in relation to others? |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=155–75 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.155}}</ref> Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they have a set of rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.<ref name="Pietro" /><ref name="Rholes, Simpson, 2004">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title=Attachment theory: Basic concepts and contemporary questions |encyclopedia=Adult Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |pages=3–14 |isbn=978-1-59385-047-0 |vauthors=Rholes WS, Simpson JA |veditors=Rholes WS, Simpson JA}}</ref>

There are a number of different measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the [[Attachment measures#Adult Attachment Interview .28AAI.29|Adult Attachment Interview]]. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, platonic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.<ref name="crofrasha">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Measurement of Individual Differences in Adolescent and Adult Attachment |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=599–634 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2 |vauthors=Crowell JA, Fraley RC, Shaver PR |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR}}</ref>

Adult attachment styles are related to individual differences in the ways in which adults experience and manage their emotions.

==History==
{{Main|History of attachment theory}}

===Maternal deprivation===
{{Main|Maternal deprivation}}
The early thinking of the [[Object relations theory|object relations school]] of [[psychoanalysis]], particularly [[Melanie Klein]], influenced Bowlby. However, he profoundly disagreed with the prevalent psychoanalytic belief that infants' responses relate to their internal fantasy life rather than real-life events. As Bowlby formulated his concepts, he was influenced by case studies on disturbed and delinquent children, such as those of [[William Goldfarb]] published in 1943 and 1945.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Review of evidence on effects of deprivation.

The maternal deprivation hypothesis published in 1951 spurred a shift away from the use of residential nurseries in favour of foster homes.<ref name=rut/>]]

Bowlby's contemporary [[René Spitz]] observed separated children's grief, proposing that "psychotoxic" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care.<ref name="spitz1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spitz RA | title = Hospitalism; an inquiry into the genesis of psychiatric conditions in early childhood | journal = The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 1 | pages = 53–74 | year = 1945 | pmid = 21004303 | doi = 10.1080/00797308.1945.11823126 }}</ref><ref name="spitz">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spitz RA |year=1951 |title=The psychogenic diseases in infancy |journal=The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child |volume=6 |pages=255–75 |doi=10.1080/00797308.1952.11822915}}</ref> A strong influence was the work of social worker and psychoanalyst [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film ''A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital'' which was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visits by parents.<ref name="Schwartz">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Schwartz | name-list-style = vanc |title=Cassandra's Daughter: A History of Psychoanalysis  |publisher=Viking/Allen Lane |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-670-88623-4 |location=New York |page=225}}</ref>

In his 1951 monograph for the [[World Health Organization]], [[Maternal deprivation|''Maternal Care and Mental Health'']], Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment", the lack of which may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This was also published as ''Child Care and the Growth of Love'' for public consumption. The central proposition was influential but highly controversial.<ref name="WHO 62">{{cite book |title=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects |publisher=World Health Organization |year=1962 |series=Public Health Papers |location=Geneva |chapter=Preface |issue=14}}</ref> At the time there was limited empirical data and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Secure Base: Clinical Applications of Attachment Theory | vauthors = Bowlby J |publisher=Routledge |year=1988 |isbn=978-0415006408 |location=London |page=24}}</ref> Nevertheless, Bowlby's theory sparked considerable interest in the nature of early relationships, giving a strong impetus to, (in the words of Mary Ainsworth), a "great body of research" in an extremely difficult, complex area.<ref name="WHO 62" />

Bowlby's work (and Robertson's films) caused a virtual revolution in a hospital visiting by parents, hospital provision for children's play, educational and social needs, and the use of residential nurseries. Over time, orphanages were abandoned in favour of foster care or family-style homes in most developed countries.<ref name="rut">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Implications of Attachment Theory and Research for Child Care Policies |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=958–74 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2 | vauthors = Rutter M | veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR}}</ref>

===Formulation of the theory===
Following the publication of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health'', Bowlby sought new understanding from the fields of evolutionary biology, ethology, [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and control systems theory. He formulated the innovative proposition that mechanisms underlying an infant's emotional tie to the caregiver(s) emerged as a result of [[evolutionary pressure]]. He set out to develop a theory of motivation and behaviour control built on science rather than Freud's psychic energy model. Bowlby argued that with attachment theory he had made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''.<ref name="Bowlby 86">{{cite web |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1986/A1986F063100001.pdf |title=Citation Classic, ''Maternal Care and Mental Health'' | vauthors = Bowlby J |date=December 1986 |publisher=Current Contents |access-date=July 13, 2008 |volume=50 |issue=18}}</ref>

====Ethology====
Bowlby's attention was drawn to [[ethology]] in the early 1950s when he read [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s work.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bretherton |first=Inge | name-list-style = vanc |year=1992 |title=The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth |url=http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/online/inge_origins.pdf |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=759–775 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}</ref>  Other important influences were ethologists [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and [[Robert Hinde]].{{sfn|Holmes|1993|p=62}} Bowlby subsequently collaborated with Hinde.<ref name="3 vans">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bowlby J | title = John Bowlby and ethology: an annotated interview with Robert Hinde | journal = Attachment & Human Development | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–35 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17852051 | doi = 10.1080/14616730601149809 }}</ref> In 1953 Bowlby stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests."<ref name="bowlby 53">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bowlby J |year=1953 |title=Critical Phases in the Development of Social Responses in Man and Other Animals |journal=New Biology |volume=14 |pages=25–32}}</ref> Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "[[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]", a behaviour characteristic of some birds and mammals which involves rapid learning of recognition by the young, of a [[wikt:conspecific|conspecific]] or comparable object. After recognition comes a tendency to follow.
[[File:Moose-Imprinting-sr81-15.jpg|thumb|right |alt=A young woman in rubber boots is walking with arms crossed through a muddy clearing in a birch wood, followed by a young moose calf running through a puddle|This bottle-fed young moose has developed an attachment to its caregiver (at [[Kostroma Moose Farm]]).]]

Certain types of learning are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range known as a [[critical period]]. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions.{{sfn|Bowlby|1982|pp=220-23}} Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.<ref name="Rutter 95" />

Ethologists expressed concern about the adequacy of some research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalization to humans from animal studies.<ref name="crnic">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1982 |title=Animal models of human behavior: Their application to the study of attachment |encyclopedia=The development of attachment and affiliative systems |publisher=Plenum |location=New York |pages=31–42 |isbn=978-0-306-40849-6 |vauthors=Crnic LS, Reite ML, Shucard DW |veditors=Emde RN, Harmon RJ}}</ref><ref name="Brann">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1972 |title=Human non-verbal behaviour: A means of communication |encyclopedia=Ethological studies of child behaviour |publisher=Cambridge University Press | veditors = Blurton-Jones N |pages=37–64 |isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |quote=...&nbsp;it must be emphasized that data derived from species other than man can be used only to ''suggest'' hypotheses that may be worth applying to man for testing by critical observations.

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] concepts influenced Bowlby's view of attachment, in particular, the observations by [[Anna Freud]] and [[Dorothy Burlingham]] of young children separated from familiar caregivers during World War II.<ref name="anna">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/Freud_Burlingham_1943_War_and_Children_k |title=War and children |vauthors=Freud A, Burlingham DT |publisher=Medical War Books |year=1943 |isbn=978-0-8371-6942-2}}</ref> However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including "[[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|drive theory]]" in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the "[[Cupboard Love|cupboard-love]]" theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality.{{sfn|Holmes|1993|pp=62–63}} Based on ideas of primary attachment and [[Neo-Darwinism]], Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis: the overemphasis of internal dangers rather than external threat, and the view of the development of personality via linear ''phases'' with [[regression (psychology)|''regression'']] to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Bowlby instead posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.{{sfn|Holmes|1993|pp=64–65}}

From early in the development of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches of psychoanalysis. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.<ref name="Steele">{{cite journal |vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year=1998 |title=Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion |journal=Social Development |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=92–119 |doi=10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}</ref><ref name="Cass 98">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cassidy J |year=1998 |title=Commentary on Steele and Steele: Attachment and object relations theories and the concept of independent behavioral systems |journal=Social Development |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=120–26 |doi=10.1111/1467-9507.00054}}</ref><ref name="Steele 98">{{cite journal |vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year=1998 |title=Debate: Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion |journal=Social Development |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=92–119 |doi=10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}</ref>

====Internal working model====
The philosopher [[Kenneth Craik]] had noted the ability of thought to predict events. He stressed the survival value of natural selection for this ability. A key component of attachment theory is the attachment behavior system where certain behaviors have a predictable outcome (i.e. proximity) and serve as self-preservation method (i.e. protection).<ref name="Cassidy, Jude 2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cassidy J, Jones JD, Shaver PR | title = Contributions of attachment theory and research: a framework for future research, translation, and policy | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 25 | issue = 4 Pt 2 | pages = 1415–34 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24342848 | pmc = 4085672 | doi = 10.1017/s0954579413000692 }}</ref> All taking place outside of an individuals awareness,  This [[Internal Working Model of Attachment|internal working model]] allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik's ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.<ref name="JLaird">{{cite book |title=Mental models | vauthors = Johnson-Laird PN |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-674-56881-5 |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=179–87}}</ref>

Infants absorb all sorts of complex social-emotional information from the social interactions that they observe. They notice the helpful and hindering behaviors of one person to another. From these observations they develop expectations of how two characters should behave, known as a "secure base script." These scripts provide as a template of how attachment related events should unfold and they are the building blocks of ones internal working models.<ref name="Cassidy, Jude 2013"/>  [[infant]]'s internal working model is developed in response to the infant's experience based internal working models of self, and environment, with emphasis on the caregiving environment and the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviors. Theoretically, secure child and adult script, would allow for an attachment situation where one person successfully utilizes another as a secure base from which to explore and as a safe haven in times of distress. In contrast, insecure individuals would create attachment situations with more complications.<ref name="Cassidy, Jude 2013"/> For example, If the caregiver is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the caregiver consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the caregiver inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Main M, Kaplan N, Cassidy J |year=1985 |title=Security in Infancy, Childhood, and Adulthood: A Move to the Level of Representation |journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development |volume=50 |issue=1/2 |pages=66–104 |doi=10.2307/3333827 |jstor=3333827}}</ref> In retrospect, internal working models are constant with and reflect the primary relationship with our caregivers.

A [[parent]]'s internal working model that is operative in the attachment relationship with her infant can be accessed by examining the parent's mental representations.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Lieberman AF |title=Attachment and psychopathology |pages=277–292 |year=1997 | veditors = Atkinson L, Zucker KJ |chapter=Toddlers' internalization of maternal attributions as a factor in quality of attachment |place=New York, NY, US |publisher=Guilford Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeanah CH, Keener MA, Anders TF | title = Adolescent mothers' prenatal fantasies and working models of their infants | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 193–203 | date = August 1986 | pmid = 3749375 | doi = 10.1080/00332747.1986.11024321 }}</ref> Recent research has demonstrated that the quality of maternal attributions as markers of maternal mental representations can be associated with particular forms of maternal psychopathology and can be altered in a relative short time-period by targeted psychotherapeutic intervention.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schechter DS, Moser DA, Reliford A, McCaw JE, Coates SW, Turner JB, Serpa SR, Willheim E | display-authors = 6 | title = Negative and distorted attributions towards child, self, and primary attachment figure among posttraumatically stressed mothers: what changes with Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions (CAVES) | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–20 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 24553738 | pmc = 4139484 | doi = 10.1007/s10578-014-0447-5 }}</ref>

====Cybernetics====
The theory of control systems ([[cybernetics]]), developing during the 1930s and '40s, influenced Bowlby's thinking.<ref name="Robbins">{{cite journal | vauthors = Robbins P, Zacks JM | s2cid = 17846200 | title = Attachment theory and cognitive science: commentary on Fonagy and Target | journal = Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 457–67; discussion 493–501 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17601100 | doi = 10.1177/00030651070550021401 }}</ref> The young child's need for proximity to the attachment figure was seen as balancing [[Homeostasis|homeostatically]] with the need for exploration. (Bowlby compared this process to physiological homeostasis whereby, for example, blood pressure is kept within limits). The actual distance maintained by the child would vary as the balance of needs changed. For example, the approach of a stranger, or an injury, would cause the child exploring at a distance to seek proximity. The child's goal is not an object (the caregiver) but a state; maintenance of the desired distance from the caregiver depending on circumstances.<ref name="Cassidy"/>

====Cognitive development====
Bowlby's reliance on [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s theory of cognitive development gave rise to questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) in early attachment behaviours. An infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seemed to occur months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible.<ref name="fraiberg">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraiberg S | title = Libidinal object constancy and mental representation | journal = The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 24 | pages = 9–47 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5353377 | doi = 10.1080/00797308.1969.11822685 }}</ref> More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be more specific than those of Bowlby's time.<ref name="waters2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waters HS, Waters E | title = The attachment working models concept: among other things, we build script-like representations of secure base experiences | journal = Attachment & Human Development | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 185–97 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16938702 | doi = 10.1080/14616730600856016 | s2cid = 11443750 }}</ref>

====Behaviorism====
In 1969, Gerwitz discussed how mother and child could provide each other with positive reinforcement experiences through their mutual attention, thereby learning to stay close together. This explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment.<ref name= "Gewirtz">{{cite journal| vauthors = Gewirtz N|year=1969|title=Potency of a social reinforcer as a function of satiation and recovery|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 1|pages= 2–13|doi= 10.1037/h0026802}}</ref> Learning theory, ([[behaviorism]]), saw attachment as a remnant of dependency with the quality of attachment being merely a response to the caregiver's cues. Behaviorists saw behaviors like crying as a random activity meaning nothing until reinforced by a caregiver's response. To behaviorists, frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behavior to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists' view.<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 166–73.</ref>

In the last decade, [[Behavior analysis of child development|behavior analysts]] have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] relationships. These behavior analytic models have received some support from research<ref name="kassow">{{cite journal| vauthors = Kassow DZ, Dunst CJ|year=2004|title= Relationship between parental contingent-responsiveness and attachment outcomes|journal= Bridges|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 1–17}}</ref> and meta-analytic reviews.<ref name="dunst">{{cite journal| vauthors = Dunst CJ, Kassow DZ |year=2008|title= Caregiver Sensitivity, Contingent Social Responsiveness, and Secure Infant Attachment|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention|volume= 5|issue=1|pages= 40–56|doi=10.1037/h0100409|issn=1554-4893}}</ref>

====Developments since 1970s====
In the 1970s, problems with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with organizing functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life.<ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sroufe LA, Waters E |year=1977 |title=Attachment as an organizational construct |journal=Child Development |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1184–99 |doi=10.2307/1128475 |jstor=1128475}}</ref> This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct.<ref name="WatCum">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waters E, Cummings EM | title = A secure base from which to explore close relationships | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–72 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10836570 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00130 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.505.6759 }}</ref> Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined.<ref name="Tronick">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tronick EZ, Morelli GA, Ivey PK |s2cid=1756552 |year=1992 |title=The Efe forager infant and toddler's pattern of social relationships: Multiple and simultaneous |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=568–77 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.4.568}}</ref> The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm. The selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies.<ref name="ijzsag">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Cross-Cultural Patterns of Attachment; Universal and Contextual Dimensions |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=880–905 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2 |vauthors=van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR}}</ref> How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example [[Kisii people|Gusii]] infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices.<ref name=ijzsag/> The scholar [[Michael Rutter]] in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children.<ref>{{cite book | first = Michael | last = Rutter | name-list-style = vanc | date = 1974 | title = The Qualities of Mothering | location = New York, N.Y. }}</ref> Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.

The biggest challenge to the notion of the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of ''[[amae]]'' plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where ''amae'' is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory.<ref name=ijzsag/> Most recently a 2007 study conducted in [[Sapporo]] in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.<ref name="Behrens">{{cite journal | vauthors = Behrens KY, Hesse E, Main M | title = Mothers' attachment status as determined by the Adult Attachment Interview predicts their 6-year-olds' reunion responses: a study conducted in Japan | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1553–1567 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18020832 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1553 }}</ref><ref name="MainCass">{{cite journal |vauthors=Main M, Cassidy J |year=1988 |title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=415–26 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415}}</ref>

Critics in the 1990s such as [[Judith Rich Harris|J. R. Harris]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Jerome Kagan]] were generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism ([[nature versus nurture]]), stressing the effects of later experience on personality.<ref name="harris">{{cite book |title=The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do |title-link=The Nurture Assumption | vauthors = Harris JR |publisher=Free Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-684-84409-1 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nurtureassumptio00harr_0/page/1 1–4] |author-link=Judith Rich Harris}}</ref><ref name="pinker">{{cite book |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |title-link=The Blank Slate | vauthors = Pinker S |publisher=Allen Lane |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-14-027605-3 |location=London |pages=372–99 |author-link=Steven Pinker}}</ref><ref name="kagan">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/threeseductiveid00kaga_0/page/83 |title=Three Seductive Ideas | vauthors = Kagan J |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-674-89033-6 |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=[https://archive.org/details/threeseductiveid00kaga_0/page/83 83–150]}}</ref> Building on the work on [[temperament]] of [[Stella Chess]], Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament.<ref name=vbv/> Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.<ref name="schaffer">{{cite book |title=Introducing Child Psychology | vauthors =Schaffer HR |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-631-21627-8 |location=Oxford |page=113}}</ref>

Psychoanalyst/psychologists [[Peter Fonagy]] and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship through cognitive science as [[mentalization]]. Mentalization, or theory of mind, is the capacity of human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression.<ref name="Fonagy et al.">{{cite book |title=Affect regulation, mentalization, and the development of the self |vauthors=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Jurist EL, Target M |publisher=Other Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-59051-161-9 |location=New York}}</ref> It has been speculated that this connection between theory of mind and the internal working model may open new areas of study, leading to alterations in attachment theory.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|pp=165–68}} Since the late 1980s, there has been a developing rapprochement between attachment theory and psychoanalysis, based on common ground as elaborated by attachment theorists and researchers, and a change in what psychoanalysts consider to be central to psychoanalysis. [[Object relations]] models which emphasise the autonomous need for a relationship have become dominant and are linked to a growing recognition in psychoanalysis of the importance of infant development in the context of relationships and internalized representations. Psychoanalysis has recognized the formative nature of a child's early environment including the issue of childhood trauma. A psychoanalytically based exploration of the attachment system and an accompanying clinical approach has emerged together with a recognition of the need for measurement of outcomes of interventions.<ref name="fogeta">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=783–810 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2 |contribution=Psychoanalytic Constructs and Attachment Theory and Research |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |vauthors=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Target M|title=Handbook of Attachment, Second Edition: Theory, Research, and Clinical Applications }}</ref>

One focus of attachment research has been the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late-20th century, during which some authors stressed the deleterious effects of day care.<ref name="belsky">{{cite journal | vauthors = Belsky J, Rovine MJ | title = Nonmaternal care in the first year of life and the security of infant-parent attachment | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 157–67 | date = February 1988 | pmid = 3342709 | doi = 10.2307/1130397 | jstor = 1130397 }}</ref> As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a child to a specific care-giver. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|pp=160–63}} A [[natural experiment]] permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families after the end of the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by [[Michael Rutter]], followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutter M | s2cid = 10334844 | title = Nature, nurture, and development: from evangelism through science toward policy and practice | journal = Child Development | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–21 | date = January–February 2002 | pmid = 14717240 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00388 }}</ref> Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.<ref name=PPP/>

Authors considering attachment in non-Western cultures have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time.<ref name="MC">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1985 |title=Infant temperament, mother's mode of interaction, and attachment in Japan: An interim report |encyclopedia=Growing Points of Attachment Theory and Research: Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development |volume=50 (1–2, Serial No. 209 |pages=276–97 |isbn=978-0-226-07411-5 |vauthors=Miyake K, Chen SJ |veditors=Bretherton I, Waters E}}</ref> As children's experience of care changes, so may attachment-related experiences. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers or being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change has made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries. There has been an increase in the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources in first-world countries. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and gained legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|pp=152–56}} Issues have been raised to the effect that the [[wikt:dyadic|dyadic]] model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences, as infants often have multiple relationships within the family and in child care settings.<ref name="McHale">{{cite journal | vauthors = McHale JP | title = When infants grow up in multiperson relationship systems | journal = Infant Mental Health Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–392 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 21512615 | pmc = 3079566 | doi = 10.1002/imhj.20142 }}</ref> It is suggested these multiple relationships influence one another reciprocally, at least within a family.<ref name="Zhang">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang X, Chen H | title = Reciprocal influences between parents' perceptions of mother-child and father-child relationships: a short-term longitudinal study in Chinese preschoolers | journal = The Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 171 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–34 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20333893 | doi = 10.1080/00221320903300387 | s2cid = 35227740 }}</ref>

Studies show that attachment in adulthood is simultaneously related to biomarkers of immunity.

== Crime ==
Attachment theory has often been applied in the discipline of [[criminology]]. It has been used in an attempt to identify causal mechanisms in criminal behaviour – with uses ranging from [[offender profiling]], better understanding types of offence and the pursuit of preventative policy. It has been found that disturbances early on in child-caregiver relationships are a risk factor in criminality. Attachment theory in this context has been described as "perhaps the most influential of contemporary psychoanalytically oriented theories of crime".<ref>{{cite book |title=Psychology and Crime: An Introduction to Criminological Psychology |last=Hollin |first=Clive R. | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |location=USA & Canada |pages=62}}</ref>

=== History ===
In the 1870s, [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s "born criminal" theory, which posited that criminality was innate and inherited, had dominated thinking in criminology. The introduction of attachment theory in criminal theory created a shift away from seeing an individual as being "genetically doomed"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dixon |first=Angela | name-list-style = vanc |date=2003 |title='At all costs let us avoid any risk of allowing our hearts to be broken again': A review of John Bowlby's Forty-Four Juvenile Thieves |journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=279 |doi=10.1177/1359104503008002011|s2cid=144508353 }}</ref> to criminality, to instead studying criminal behaviour from a developmental perspective.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The origins of attachment theory within criminology can be found in the work of [[August Aichhorn]]. In applying psychoanalysis to [[pedagogy]] he argued that abnormal child development, stemming from relationship difficulties, underlies many instances of delinquency. He believed that within insecure child-parent relationships, socialisation may go awry, causing an arrest in the child's development allowing latent delinquency to become dominant.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wayward Youth |last=Aichhorn |first=August | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=The Viking Press |year=1935 |location=the University of Michigan}}</ref>

The intersection of crime and attachment theory was further researched by John Bowlby. In his first published work, ''Forty-four Juvenile Thieves'', he studied a sample of 88 children (44 juvenile thieves and 44 non-delinquent controls) to investigate the home life experiences of these two groups. It was identified that child-mother separation was a causative factor in delinquent character formation, particularly in the development of an "affectionless character" often seen in the persistent offender. 17 of the juvenile thieves had been separated from their mothers for longer than six months during their first five years, and only 2 children from the control group had such a separation. He also found that 14 of the thieves were "affectionless characters" distinguishing them from others by their lack of affection, no emotional ties, no real friendships, and having "no roots in their relationships".<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last=Bowlby |first=John | name-list-style = vanc |date=Jan 1, 1944 |title=Forty-four Juvenile Thieves: their Characters and Home-Life |journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis |volume=25}}</ref> He wrote:

<blockquote>They have a remarkably distinctive early history—prolonged separations from their mothers or foster-mothers—the conclusion forces itself upon one that we have here not only a distinct clinical syndrome, that of the Affectionless thief, but also an unusually clear example of the distorting influence of a bad early environment upon the development of personality.<ref name=":2" /></blockquote>

These 'affectionless' delinquents were children who, in the first 12 months of life, either had formed a bond with their mother which had subsequently been disrupted, or failed to form a bond at all. 14 of the 17 affectionless delinquents had experienced multiple moves between caregivers. Amongst the control group, there were no affectionless characters. He also noted that delinquents of an 'Affectionless Character' were far more likely to steal in a persistent and serious way than are delinquents of other types.

=== Age distribution of crime ===
The relationship between age and crime is one of the most replicated findings in criminology. It has been named "one of the brute facts of criminology"<ref name=":3">{{cite journal |last1=Hirschi |first1=Travis |last2=Gottfredson |first2=Michael |s2cid=144647077 | name-list-style = vanc |date=1983 |title=Age and the Explanation of Crime |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=552–584 |doi=10.1086/227905 |issn=0002-9602 |jstor=2779005}}</ref> claiming that "no fact about crime is more widely accepted."<ref name=":3" />  It has shown that the prevalence of offending increases during adolescence, peaks around the late teenage years and early twenties, and subsequently decreases sharply. Whilst the age-crime curve is regarded as fact, the mechanisms driving it are largely disputed.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The two main theories, developmental theory and life-course theory, have attachment theory in their origin. Developmental perspectives place importance on the role of childhood experiences, and argue that this can determine criminal patterns later on i.e. individuals who have disrupted childhood attachments, amongst other factors, will have criminal careers that continue long into adulthood.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moffitt TE, Caspi A | title = Childhood predictors differentiate life-course persistent and adolescence-limited antisocial pathways among males and females | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 355–75 | date = 2001 | pmid = 11393651 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579401002097 | s2cid = 29182035 }}</ref> [[Life course approach|Life course perspectives]] do not entirely deny the importance of childhood experiences, but argue that developmental theory is too deterministic in nature. Instead they argue that because humans have agency, every stage of the life course matters. Early childhood experiences remain important, albeit within a framework of [[Cumulative inequality theory|cumulative disadvantage]], and attachments later on in life can determine whether an individual will be likely to offend or not.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampson RJ, Laub JH |date=2005 |title=A Life-Course View of the Development of Crime |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |volume=602|pages=12–45 |doi=10.1177/0002716205280075 |s2cid=45146032 }}</ref>

=== Developmental perspectives ===
The developmental perspective aims to explain the age-crime curve by two qualitatively distinct types of people and their behavioural trajectories; adolescence-limited (those who start their criminal career in adolescence and desist from crime before adulthood) and life-course persistent (those who begin anti-social behaviour in adolescence and continue this criminal behaviour into adulthood).<ref name=":4" />

Attachment theory has been used to identify differences between these two trajectories. Life-course persistent offenders start with disrupted attachment relationships in their childhood, which drives a disordered personality and long term antisocial behaviours and criminal careers. By contrast, adolescence-limited offenders do not have disrupted family bonds and are described as having healthy pre-delinquent development.<ref name=":4" />

=== Life-course perspectives ===
The life-course perspective argues that individuals are not automatically assigned to a category in a dual taxonomy. Instead, there are within-individual changes in criminality, due to human agency. Individuals who have insecure attachment styles in childhood can therefore later create meaningful social ties and thereby desist from crime, allowing changes to criminality at different stages in the life course.<ref name=":5" />

=== Types of offenses ===
Since early childhood relationships can influence interpersonal relationships throughout the lifespan,<ref>{{cite book |title=A secure base: Parent-child attachment and healthy human development. |last=Bowlby |first=John | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Basic Books |year=1988 |location=New York, NY, USA}}</ref> attachment theory has been applied in research into particular crimes, particularly those which tend to occur within close relational ties.

Disrupted attachment patterns from childhood have been identified as a risk factor for domestic violence.<ref name=":6">{{cite web | vauthors = Gilchrist E, Johnson R, Takriti R, Weston S, Anthony Beech A, Kebbell M | url = http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r217.pdf | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218141158/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r217.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2011-02-18 | title = Domestic Violence offenders: characteristics and offending related needs | date = 2003 | work = Research, Development and Statistics Directorate | publisher = United Kingdom Home Office | access-date = 2019-03-29 }}</ref> These disruptions in childhood can prevent the formation of a secure attachment relationship, and in turn adversely affecting a healthy way to deal with stress.<ref name=":7">{{cite journal |last1=Kesner |first1=John E. |last2=Julian |first2=Teresa |last3=McKenry |first3=Patrick C. | name-list-style = vanc |date=1997-06-01 |title=Application of Attachment Theory to Male Violence Toward Female Intimates |journal=Journal of Family Violence |language=en |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=211–228 |doi=10.1023/A:1022840812546 |s2cid=26203922 |issn=1573-2851}}</ref> In adulthood, lack of coping mechanisms can result in intense conflict resulting in violent behaviour.<ref>{{cite book |title=Frustration and aggression |last1=Dollard |first1=John |last2=Miller |first2=Neal E. |last3=Doob |first3=Leonard W. |last4=Mowrer |first4=O.

This has been extended to theorise why domestic violence occurs; an adult with consistent experience of insecure attachment may use physical violence to express their attachment needs not being met by their partners. This perception of low support from partner has been identified as a strong predictor of male violence. &nbsp;Other predictors have been named as perceived deficiency in maternal love in childhood, low self-esteem.<ref name=":7" /> It has also been found that individuals with a dismissive attachment style, often seen in an antisocial/narcissistic-narcissistic subtype of offender, tend to be emotionally abusive as well as violent. Individuals in the borderline/emotionally dependent subtype have traits which originate from insecure attachment in childhood, and tend to have high levels of anger.<ref name=":6" />

It has been found that sexual offenders have significantly less secure maternal and paternal attachments compared with non-offenders which suggests that insecure attachments in infancy persist into adulthood.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smallbone S, Dadds M  |date=October 1998 |title=Childhood Attachment and Adult Attachment in Incarcerated Adult Male Sex Offenders |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=13 5}}</ref> In a recent study, 57% of sexual offenders were found to be of a preoccupied attachment style.<ref>{{cite book |title=What Works in Therapeutic Prisons | vauthors = Brown J, Miller S, Northey S, O'Neill D |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-137-30620-3 |location=London |chapter=Attachments: The Multiple Sorting Task Procedure |doi=10.1057/9781137306210}}</ref> There is also evidence that suggests subtypes of sexual crime can have different attachment styles. Dismissive individuals tend to be hostile towards others, and are more likely to offend violently against adult women. By contrast, child abusers are more likely to have preoccupied attachment styles as the tendency to seek approval from others becomes distorted and attachment relationships become sexualised.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ward T, Beech A |date=2006 |title=An integrated theory of sexual offending |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=11 |pages=44–63 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.05.002}}</ref>

==Practical applications==
As a theory of [[Developmental psychology|socioemotional development]], attachment theory has implications and practical applications in social policy, decisions about the care and welfare of children and mental health.

===Child care policies===
Social policies concerning the care of children were the driving force in Bowlby's development of attachment theory. The difficulty lies in applying attachment concepts to policy and practice.<ref name="rut08">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Implications of Attachment Theory and Research for Child Care Policies |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse_n9k8/page/958 958–74] |isbn=978-1-60623-028-2 | vauthors = Rutter M |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |url= https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse_n9k8/page/958 }}</ref> In 2008 [[C.H.

People have commented on this matter stating that "legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions".<ref name="Sweeney GM 2007. pp. 332">{{cite book | vauthors = Sweeney GM | chapter = Why childhood attachment matters: Implications for personal happiness, families and public policy. | veditors = Loveless S, Homan T | title = The family in the new millennium. | location = Westport, CT | publisher = Praeger | date = 2007 | pages = 332–346 }}</ref> Corporations should implement more flexible work arrangements that recognize child care as essential for all its employees. This includes re-examination of parental leave policies. Too many parents are forced to return to work too soon post childbirth because of company policy or financial necessity. No matter the reason this inhibits early parent child bonding.<ref name="Cassidy, Jude 2013" /> In addition to this, there should be increased attention to the training and screening of childcare workers. In his article reviewing Attachment Theory, Sweeney suggested, among several policy implications, "legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions".<ref name="Sweeney GM 2007. pp. 332" />

Historically, attachment theory had significant policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, and those in poor quality daycare.{{sfn|Karen|1998|pp=252–58}} Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although it is difficult to provide good quality, individualized care in group settings.<ref name=rut08/>

Attachment theory has implications in [[Residence in English family law|residence]] and [[Contact (law)|contact]] disputes,{{sfn|Karen|1998|pp=252–58}} and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus focusing on the quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. [[Michael Rutter|Rutter]] noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships.<ref name="rut99">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1999 |title=Implications of Attachment Theory for Child Care Policies |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/823 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/823 823–44] |isbn=978-1-57230-087-3 |vauthors=Rutter M, O'Connor TG |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR}}</ref> Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives.

Attachment theory can also inform decisions made in [[social work]], especially in [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]] ([[Microsociology|Petru Stefaroi]]),<ref name="Stefaroi">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stefaroi P | date = 2012 | title = Humanistic Paradigm of Social Work or Brief Introduction in Humanistic Social Work. | journal = Social Work Review | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–174 | quote = ICID 985513 }}</ref><ref name="Stefaroi P.">{{cite book | vauthors = Stefaroi P | date = 2014 | title = Humane & Spiritual Qualities of the Professional in Humanistic Social Work: Humanistic Social Work – The Third Way in Theory and Practice | location = Charleston, SC | publisher = Createspace }}</ref> and court processes about [[foster care]] or other placements.

Many researchers in the field were strongly influenced by it.<ref name=rut08/>

===Clinical practice in children===
Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of [[Developmental psychology|socioemotional development]] with one of the widest research lines in modern psychology, it has, until recently, been less used in clinical practice.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The attachment theory focused on the attention of the child when the mother is there and the responses that the child shows when the mother leaves, which indicated the attachment and bonding of the mother and the child. The attention therapy is the done while the child is being restrained by the therapists and the responses displayed were noted. The tests were done to show the responses of the child.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

This may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also be partly due to the mistaken association of attachment theory with the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] interventions misleadingly known as "[[attachment therapy]]".<ref name="Ziv">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title=Attachment-Based Intervention programs: Implications for Attachment Theory and Research |encyclopedia=Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |series=Duke series in child development and public policy |page=63 |isbn=978-1-59385-470-6 | vauthors = Ziv Y |veditors=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT}}</ref>

====Prevention and treatment====
{{Main|Attachment-based therapy (children)}}
In 1988, Bowlby published a series of lectures indicating how attachment theory and research could be used in understanding and treating child and family disorders.

====Reactive attachment disorder and attachment disorder====
{{Main|Reactive attachment disorder|Attachment disorder}}
One atypical attachment pattern is considered to be an actual disorder, known as ''reactive attachment disorder'' or RAD, which is a recognized psychiatric diagnosis ([[ICD-10]] F94.1/2 and [[DSM-IV-TR]] 313.89). Against common misconception, this is not the same as 'disorganized attachment'. The essential feature of reactive attachment disorder is markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before age five years, associated with gross pathological care. There are two subtypes, one reflecting a disinhibited attachment pattern, the other an inhibited pattern. RAD is not a description of insecure attachment styles, however problematic those styles may be; instead, it denotes a lack of age-appropriate attachment behaviours that may appear to resemble a clinical disorder.<ref name="Thompson (2000)">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson RA | s2cid = 18055255 | title = The legacy of early attachments | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 145–52 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10836568 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00128 }}</ref> Although the term "reactive attachment disorder" is now popularly applied to perceived behavioural difficulties that fall outside the DSM or ICD criteria, particularly on the Web and in connection with the pseudo-scientific attachment therapy, "true" RAD is thought to be rare.<ref name="chaffin">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaffin M, Hanson R, Saunders BE, Nichols T, Barnett D, Zeanah C, Berliner L, Egeland B, Newman E, Lyon T, LeTourneau E, Miller-Perrin C | s2cid = 11443880 | display-authors = 6 | title = Report of the APSAC task force on attachment therapy, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment problems | journal = Child Maltreatment | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–89 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16382093 | doi = 10.1177/1077559505283699 }}</ref>

"Attachment disorder" is an ambiguous term, which may refer to reactive attachment disorder or to the more problematic insecure attachment styles (although none of these are clinical disorders). It may also be used to refer to proposed new classification systems put forward by theorists in the field,{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|pp=223–25}} and is used within attachment therapy as a form of unvalidated diagnosis.<ref name="chaffin" /> One of the proposed new classifications, "secure base distortion" has been found to be associated with caregiver traumatization.<ref name="schecter">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schechter DS, Willheim E | title = Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–86 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19486844 | pmc = 2690512 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2009.03.001 }}</ref>

===Clinical practice in adults and families===
As attachment theory offers a broad, far-reaching view of human functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment.<ref name="Slade 2008">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Attachment Theory and Research: Implications for the theory and practice of individual psychotherapy with adults |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=762–82 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2 | vauthors = Slade A |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR}}</ref> Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within [[relational psychoanalysis]] and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns.<ref name="Slade 2008" /><ref name="Sable">{{cite book |title=Attachment & Adult Psychotherapy | vauthors = Sable P |publisher=Aaronson |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7657-0284-5 |location=Northvale, NJ}}</ref>

==Criticism==
For attachment theory to be viable, it must be believed that attachment behavior is entirely affected by one's environment.  A 2016 article from the ''Psychological Bulletin'' suggests that one's attachment is largely due to [[heredity]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barbaro |first1=Nicole |title=Rethinking the Transmission Gap: What Behavioral Genetics and Evolutionary Psychology Mean for Attachment Theory |url=http://toddkshackelford.com/downloads/Barbaro-et-al-PsychBull.pdf |publisher=Psychological Bulletin}}</ref>  In an interview, Dr. [[Jerome Kagan]] also suggests that a child's behavior is largely due to [[temperament]], as well as social class and culture.  He further states, "Attachment is a far less popular explanation in 2019 than it was in the 1960s, and in 10 to 15 years, it’s going to be rare to find anyone defending the theory. It’s just dying out slowly...Yes, what happens to you in the first year or two of life has an effect, but it’s tiny. If I take a 1-year-old child who is securely attached, and the parents die and the child is adopted by a cruel foster parent, that child is in trouble. Their secure attachment is useless. When you think about it, it’s silly that after the first year you could predict with any confidence what this person is going to be like in 20 years. It’s a ridiculous idea."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vinopal |first1=Lauren |title=Attachment Theory Is All Wrong. Here's What the Science Really Says |date=9 July 2019 |url=https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/attachment-theory-wrong-attachment-styles-dont-matter/ |publisher=Fatherly}}</ref>

Attachment theory suggests the idea of an all-encompassing label to describe one person, but a 2013 study from Utah State suggests an individual can have different attachment styles in relation to different people.  The study further concludes, "The relationship between father-child and mother-child attachment was not significant. Likewise, the relationship between child temperament and parent-child attachment was not significant. Also, parents’ time away from their child was not a significant predictor of attachment."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benware |first1=Jared |title=Predictors of F ors of Father-Child and Mother-Child A ather-Child and Mother-Child Attachment in T ttachment in TwoParent Families |url=https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=2731&context=etd |publisher=Utah State University}}</ref> Attachment theory models are based on stressful situations and it focuses heavily on attachment to the mother and doesn't value as much the attachments to other family members and peers.<ref name="field">{{cite journal | vauthors = Field T | s2cid = 15251864 | title = Attachment and separation in young children | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 541–61 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8624142 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.47.1.541 }}</ref>  [[Salvador Minuchin]] suggested that attachment theory's focus on the mother-child relation ignores the value in other familial influences: "The entire family—not just the mother or primary caretaker—including father, siblings, grandparents, often cousins, aunts and uncles, are extremely significant in the experience of the child...And yet, when I hear attachment theorists talk, I don't hear anything about these other important figures in a child's life."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wylie |first1=Mary Sykes |title=Do We Still Need Attachment Theory? |url=https://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/blog/details/1103/do-we-still-need-attachment-theory |publisher=Psychotherapy Networker}}</ref>

In exploring the relationship between childhood attachment and romantic relationships, a 2013 study concluded, "The first variable of attachment to parent, compared to romantic partner, had a medium effect size. This would suggest that the attachment to a parent is occasionally associated to the attachment to romantic partner, but is not strongly correlated."  Additional variables comparing relationship quality/satisfaction, care/avoidance and alienation/anxiety fail to have strong correlations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Twedt |first1=Matia |title=A Comparison of the Attachment with Parents and the Attachment of Romantic Partner |url=https://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1013&context=psychology_students |publisher=College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University}}</ref>
