Who is considered part of "the people" and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries, but over time more and more of a democratic country's inhabitants have generally been included. Cornerstones of democracy include [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of association|association]] and [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[Social exclusion#Social inclusion|inclusiveness]] and [[political equality|equality]], [[citizenship]], [[consent of the governed]], [[voting rights]], freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the [[right to life]] and [[liberty]], and [[minority rights]].

The notion of democracy has evolved over time considerably. The original form of democracy was a direct democracy. The most common form of democracy today is a [[representative democracy]], where the people elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a [[parliamentary democracy|parliamentary]] or [[presidential democracy]].<ref name="Tangian2020Book">{{Cite book

Prevalent day-to-day decision making of democracies is the [[majority rule]],<ref name= "webster">{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy|title=Definition of DEMOCRACY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref><ref>Locke, John.

No rational people could desire and constitute a society that had to dissolve straightaway because the majority was unable to make the final decision and the society was incapable of acting as one body."[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_4BGe7-pFIC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=%E2%80%9CThere+is+no+practical+alternative+to+majority+political+rule+%E2%80%93+i.e.,+to+taking+the+consent+of+the+majority+as+the+act+of+the+whole+and+binding+every+individual."#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CThere is no practical alternative to majority political rule %E2%80%93 i.e., to taking the consent of the majority as the act of the whole and binding every individual."&f=false Google Books].</ref> though other decision making approaches like [[supermajority]] and [[consensus democracy|consensus]] have also been integral to democracies. They serve the crucial purpose of inclusiveness and broader legitimacy on sensitive issues—counterbalancing [[majoritarianism]]—and therefore mostly take precedence on a constitutional level. In the common variant of [[liberal democracy]], the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but the [[constitution]] limits the majority and protects the minority—usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, e.g. freedom of speech or freedom of association.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "democracy".</ref><ref name="Brittanica">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Watkins |first1=Frederick |title=Democracy |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=1970 |publisher=William Benton |isbn=978-0-85229-135-1 |pages=215–23 |edition=Expo '70 hardcover |language=en |volume=7}}</ref>

The term appeared in the 5th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in [[Greek city-state]]s, notably [[Classical Athens]], to mean "rule of the people", in contrast to [[aristocracy]] ({{lang|grc|ἀριστοκρατία}}, ''{{lang|la|aristokratía}}''), meaning "rule of an elite".<ref>Wilson, N.G. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''. New York: Routledge. p. 511. {{ISBN|0-415-97334-1}}.</ref> [[Western democracy]], as distinct from that which existed in antiquity, is generally considered to have originated in [[city-states]] such as those in Classical Athens and the [[Roman Republic]], where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in [[Western world|the West]] at the beginning of [[late antiquity]]. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the [[suffrage]] movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in [[autocracy|autocratic]] systems like [[absolute monarchy]], or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an [[oligarchy]]—oppositions inherited from [[ancient Greek philosophy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Ernest|title=The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle|year=1906|publisher=G.P.

Although democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting,<ref name="Oxford"/><ref name="Brittanica" /> no consensus exists on a precise definition of  democracy.<ref name="economist2007" /> [[Karl Popper]] says that the "classical" view of democracy is simply,<ref>Popper, Karl (April 23, 1988). "The open society and its enemies revisited", [[The Economist]]'' ([https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/01/31/from-the-archives-the-open-society-and-its-enemies-revisited 2016 reprint]).</ref> "in brief, the theory that democracy is the rule of the people, and that the people have a right to rule."

Democratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being [[Equality before the law|equal before the law]] and having equal access to legislative processes.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} For example, in a [[representative democracy]], every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative,{{according to whom|date=January 2015}} and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically protected by a [[constitution]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Dahl | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = Ian | last3 = Cheibub | first3 = José Antônio | title = The democracy sourcebook | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-262-54147-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8THIuSkiqgC Details.]</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Hénaff | first1 = Marcel | last2 = Strong | first2 = Tracy B. | title = Public space and democracy | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-8166-3388-3}}</ref> Other uses of "democracy" include that of [[direct democracy]], in which issues are directly voted on by the constituents.

One theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kimber | first = Richard | title = On democracy | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 201, 199–219| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1989.tb00090.x | date = September 1989 }} [https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/view/13057/24875 Full text.]</ref> [[Legal equality]], [[political freedom]] and [[rule of law]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eXJMXnraPQC&pg=PA3|title=Assessing the Quality of Democracy|first1=Larry|last1=Diamond|first2=Leonardo|last2=Morlino|date=25 November 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8287-6|via=Google Books}}</ref> are often identified as foundational characteristics for a well-functioning democracy.<ref name="economist2007">{{cite news | last = Staff writer |url=http://www.economist.com/markets/rankings/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8908438|title=Liberty and justice for some|work=[[The Economist]] | publisher = [[Economist Group]] | date = 22 August 2007}}</ref>

The term "democracy" is sometimes used as shorthand for [[liberal democracy]], which is a variant of representative democracy that may include elements such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]]; equality before the law; the [[right to petition]] elected officials for redress of grievances; [[due process]]; [[civil liberties]]; [[human rights]]; and elements of [[civil society]] outside the government.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Roger Scruton]] argued that democracy alone cannot provide personal and political freedom unless the institutions of [[civil society]] are also present.<ref>{{cite news | last = Scruton | first = Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23607302 | title=A Point of View: Is democracy overrated? | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher= [[BBC]] | date=9 August 2013}}</ref>

In some countries, notably in the [[United Kingdom]] which originated the [[Westminster system]], the dominant principle is that of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], while maintaining [[judicial independence]].<ref name="Kopstein2014" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/sovereignty/ |title=Parliamentary sovereignty |publisher=UK Parliament |access-date=18 August 2014|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|access-date=9 November 2014}}</ref> In [[India]], parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the [[Constitution of India]] which includes [[judicial review]].<ref>{{cite news |last = Daily Express News|url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/All-party-meet-vows-to-uphold-Parliament-supremacy/2013/08/02/article1713808.ece |title=All-party meet vows to uphold Parliament supremacy |date=2 August 2013 |access-date=18 August 2013 |work=[[The New Indian Express]]| publisher = Express Publications (Madurai) Limited}}</ref> Though the term "democracy" is typically used in the context of a [[state (polity)|political state]], the principles also are applicable to private [[organisation]]s.

There are many decision-making methods used in democracies, but [[majority rule]] is the dominant form. Without compensation, like legal protections of individual or group rights, [[minority group|political minorities]] can be oppressed by the "[[tyranny of the majority]]". Majority rule is a competitive approach, opposed to [[consensus democracy]], creating the need that [[elections]], and generally [[deliberation]], are substantively and procedurally "[[wikt:fair|fair]]," i.e. [[wikt:just|just]] and [[wikt:equitable|equitable]]. In some countries, [[freedom (political)|freedom of political expression]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], and [[E-democracy|internet democracy]] are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed, enabling them to vote according to their own interests.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC&pg=PA27|title=The Judge in a Democracy|first=Aharon|last=Barak|date=2 November 2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12017-1|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kelsen | first = Hans | s2cid = 144699481 | title = Foundations of democracy | journal = Ethics | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–101 | doi = 10.1086/291036 | jstor = 2378551 | date = October 1955 }}</ref>

It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum |title=Women and human development: the capabilities approach |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-00385-8}}</ref> With its emphasis on notions of [[social contract]] and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political [[collectivism]] because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Snyder | first1 = Richard | last2 = Samuels | first2 = David | contribution = Devaluing the vote in Latin America | editor-last1 = Diamond | editor-first1 = Larry | editor-last2 = Plattner | editor-first2 = Marc F. | title = Electoral systems and democracy | page = 168 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8018-8475-7 | postscript = .}}</ref>

[[Republic]]s, though often associated with democracy because of the shared principle of rule by [[consent of the governed]], are not necessarily democracies, as [[republicanism]] does not specify ''how'' the people are to rule.<ref name="auto">[[R. R. Palmer]], ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800'' (1959)</ref>

Retrospectively different polities, outside of declared democracies, have been described as proto-democratic.

===Origins===
{{see also|Athenian democracy}}

The term ''democracy'' first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of [[Athens]] during [[classical antiquity]].<ref>John Dunn, ''Democracy: the unfinished journey 508 BC&nbsp;– 1993 AD'', Oxford University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-19-827934-5}}</ref>{{sfn|Raaflaub|Ober|Wallace|2007|p={{page needed|date=July 2014}} }} The word comes from ''dêmos'' '(common) people' and ''krátos'' 'force/might'.<ref>[[Luciano Canfora]], ''La   democrazias:Storia di un'ideologia,'' [[Laterza]]  (2004) 2018 pp.12-13</ref> Under [[Cleisthenes]],  what is generally held as the first example of a type of democracy in 508–507 BC was established in Athens. Cleisthenes is referred to as "the father of [[Athenian democracy]]".<ref>R. Po-chia Hsia, Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie G. Smith, ''The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures, A Concise History, Volume I: To 1740'' (Boston and New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2007), 44.</ref>

Athenian democracy took the form of a direct democracy, and it had two distinguishing features: the [[sortition|random selection]] of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices,<ref>Aristotle Book 6</ref> and a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens.<ref>{{cite book|first=Leonid E. |last=Grinin |url=http://www.socionauki.ru/book/early_state_en/ |title=The Early State, Its Alternatives and Analogues |publisher=Uchitel' Publishing House |year=2004}}</ref> All eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city state. However, Athenian citizenship excluded women, slaves, foreigners (μέτοικοι / ''métoikoi''), and youths below the age of military service.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=John K.|date=1977|title=Athenian Citizenship: The Descent Group and the Alternatives|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=73|issue=2|pages=105–121|jstor=3296866|issn=0009-8353}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_women_and_family?page=4|title=Women and Family in Athenian Law|website=www.stoa.org|language=en|access-date=1 March 2018}}</ref>{{Contradict-inline|article=Athenian democracy|date=September 2014}} Effectively, only 1 in 4 residents in Athens qualified as citizens. Owning land was not a requirement for citizenship.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Manville|first=Philip Brook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBcABAAAQBAJ&q=athenian citizenship requirements&pg=PA94|title=The Origins of Citizenship in Ancient Athens|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-6083-8|language=en}}</ref> The exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship. In most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns.<ref>Susan Lape, ''Reproducing Athens: Menander's Comedy, Democratic Culture, and the Hellenistic City'', Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 4, {{ISBN|1-4008-2591-1}}</ref>

Athenian democracy was not only ''direct'' in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also the ''most direct'' in the sense that the people through the assembly, [[Boule (ancient Greece)|boule]] and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.{{sfn|Raaflaub|Ober|Wallace|2007|p=5}} Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense (the ancient Greeks had no word for "rights"{{sfn|Ober|Hedrick|1996|p=107}}), those who were citizens of Athens enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.{{sfn|Clarke|Foweraker|2001|pp=194–201}}

[[Range voting]] appeared in [[Sparta]] as early as 700 BC. The [[Apella]] was an assembly of the people, held once a month, in which every male citizen of at least 30 years of age could participate. In the Apella, Spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting (the vote is then decided on how loudly the crowd shouts). [[Aristotle]] called this "childish", as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the Athenian citizenry. Sparta adopted it because of its simplicity, and to prevent any biased voting, buying, or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rangevoting.org/SpartaBury.html |title=Full historical description of the Spartan government |publisher=Rangevoting.org |access-date=28 September 2013}}</ref><ref>Terrence A. Boring, ''Literacy in Ancient Sparta'', Leiden Netherlands (1979). {{ISBN|90-04-05971-7}}</ref>

Even though the [[Roman Republic]] contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of [[gerrymandering]], so most high officials, including members of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], came from a few wealthy and noble families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://annourbis.com/Ancient-Rome/8rome10.html |title=Ancient Rome from the earliest times down to 476 A.D |publisher=Annourbis.com |access-date=22 August 2010}}</ref> In addition, the [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|overthrow of the Roman Kingdom]] was the first case in the Western world of a polity being formed with the explicit purpose of being a [[republic]], although it didn't have much of a democracy. The Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries,<ref>{{harvnb|Livy|De Sélincourt|2002|p=34}}</ref> and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader.<ref>{{harvnb|Watson|2005|p=271}}</ref>

[[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], capital city of the [[Vajji|Vajjian Confederacy]] of (Vrijji [[mahajanapada]]), [[India]] was also considered one of the first examples of a [[republic]] around the 6th century BCE.<ref>{{cite book |title=India: Lonely planet Guide|last=Bindloss|first=Joe |author2=Sarina Singh |year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn= 978-1-74104-308-2|page=556|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7ZHUhSEleYC&q=Vaishali&pg=PA556 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Students' Britannica India, Volumes 1-5 |last=Hoiberg|first=Dale |author2=Indu Ramchandani |year=2000|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=0-85229-760-2|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPP7O3nb3g0C&q=Vaishali&pg=PA208 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A history of India|last=Kulke|first=Hermann|author2=Dietmar Rothermund |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-32919-1|page= 57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPVq3ykHyH4C&q=Vaishali&pg=PA57 }}</ref>

Other cultures, such as the [[Iroquois]] Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society before they came in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Graymont|first=Barbara|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/194977|title=The Iroquois in the American Revolution|date=1972|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=0-8156-0083-6|edition=[1st ed.]|location=[Syracuse, N.Y.]|oclc=194977}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
While most regions in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]] were ruled by [[clergy]] or [[feudal lords]], there existed various systems involving elections or assemblies, although often only involving a small part of the population. In [[Scandinavia]], bodies known as [[Thing (assembly)|things]] consisted of freemen presided by a [[lawspeaker]]. These deliberative bodies were responsible for settling political questions, and variants included the [[Althing]] in [[Iceland]] and the [[Løgting]] in the [[Faeroe Islands]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2osDwAAQBAJ&q=althing+democracy&pg=PR7|title=On Democracy: Second Edition|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|date=1 October 2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-23332-2|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mG7vCgAAQBAJ&q=althing+democracy&pg=PT30|title=Heritage and Identity: Shaping the Nations of the North|last1=Fladmark|first1=J.

In [[Poland]], noble democracy was characterized by an increase in the activity of the middle [[szlachta|nobility]], which wanted to increase their share in exercising power at the expense of the magnates. Magnates dominated the most important offices in the state (secular and ecclesiastical) and sat on the royal council, later the senate. The growing importance of the middle nobility had an impact on the establishment of the institution of the land ''[[sejm]]ik'' (local assembly), which subsequently obtained more rights. During the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth century, sejmiks received more and more powers and became the most important institutions of local power. In 1454, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] granted the sejmiks the right to decide on taxes and to convene a mass mobilization in the [[Nieszawa Statutes]]. He also pledged not to create new laws without their consent.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lukowski |first1=Jerzy |last2=Zawadzki |first2=Hubert |title=A Concise History of Poland |date=January 2019 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108333993 |edition=3rd}}</ref>

After the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] was enacted in 1689 which codified certain rights and liberties and is still in effect.

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth.

Renewed interest in the Magna Carta, the English Civil War, and the Glorious Revolution in the 17th century prompted the growth of [[political philosophy]] on the British Isles. [[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first philosopher to articulate a detailed [[social contract theory]]. Writing in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), Hobbes theorized that individuals living in the [[state of nature]] led lives that were "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short" and constantly waged a [[Bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]]. In order to prevent the occurrence of an anarchic state of nature, Hobbes reasoned that individuals ceded their rights to a strong, authoritarian government. Later, philosopher and physician [[John Locke]] would posit a different interpretation of social contract theory. Writing in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689), Locke posited that all individuals possessed the inalienable rights to life, liberty and estate (property).<ref name="Locke-Laslett1988">{{cite book |title=Two Treatises of Government |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |first=John |last=Locke |author-link=John Locke |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Laslett |at=[https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofgo00john/page/ Sec. 87, 123, 209, 222] |year=1988 |orig-year=1689 |isbn=0-521-35448-X |url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofgo00john/page/}}</ref> According to Locke, individuals would voluntarily come together to form a state for the purposes of defending their rights. Particularly important for Locke were property rights, whose protection Locke deemed to be a government's primary purpose.<ref>Locke, John. ''Two Treatises on Government: a Translation into Modern English''. Quote: "Government has no other end, but the preservation of property.

For Locke, citizens had the [[right of revolution|right to revolt]] against a government that acted against their interest or became tyrannical. Although they were not widely read during his lifetime, Locke's works are considered the founding documents of [[liberalism|liberal]] thought and profoundly influenced the leaders of the [[American Revolution]] and later the [[French Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Curte|first1=Merle |date=1937|title=The Great Mr. Locke: America's Philosopher, 1783–1861|journal=The Huntington Library Bulletin|language=en|issue=11|pages=107–151|doi=10.2307/3818115|jstor=3818115 |issn=1935-0708}}</ref> His liberal democratic framework of governance remains the preeminent form of democracy in the world.

[[World War I]] and the dissolution of the autocratic [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empires resulted in the creation of new nation-states in Europe, most of them at least nominally democratic. In the 1920s democratic movements flourished and [[Timeline of women's suffrage|women's suffrage]] advanced, but the [[Great Depression]] brought disenchantment and most of the countries of Europe, Latin America, and Asia turned to strong-man rule or dictatorships. [[Fascism]] and dictatorships flourished in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], as well as non-democratic governments in the [[Baltics]], the [[Balkans]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], [[China]], and [[Japan]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.depaul.edu/contents/current/syllabi/HC_314.doc |title=Age of Dictators: Totalitarianism in the inter-war period |access-date=7 September 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907220746/http://www.snl.depaul.edu/contents/current/syllabi/HC_314.doc |archive-date=7 September 2006}}</ref>

[[World War II]] brought a definitive reversal of this trend in western Europe. The [[democratisation]] of the [[Allied Control Council|American, British, and French sectors of occupied Germany]] (disputed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=599 |title=Did the United States Create Democracy in Germany?: The Independent Review: The Independent Institute |publisher=Independent.org |access-date=22 August 2010}}</ref>), Austria, Italy, and the [[occupied Japan]] served as a model for the later theory of [[government change]]. However, most of [[Eastern Europe]], including the [[German Democratic Republic|Soviet sector of Germany]] fell into the non-democratic [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet-dominated bloc]].

The war was followed by [[decolonisation]], and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions.

A subsequent wave of [[democratisation]] brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many states, dubbed "third wave of democracy." Portugal, Spain, and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the 1970s and 1980s.{{refn|group=nb|[[Portuguese transition to democracy|Portugal in 1974]], [[Spanish democratic transition|Spain in 1975]], [[Argentine transition to democracy|Argentina in 1983]], [[History of Bolivia|Bolivia]], [[History of Uruguay|Uruguay in 1984]], [[History of Brazil (1985–present)|Brazil in 1985]], and [[Chilean transition to democracy|Chile in the early 1990s]].}} This was followed by countries in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]] by the mid-to-late 1980s. Economic malaise in the 1980s, along with resentment of Soviet oppression, contributed to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], the associated end of the [[Cold War]], and the democratisation and [[liberalisation]] of the former [[Eastern bloc]] countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now either part of the [[European Union]] or [[Potential enlargement of the European Union|candidate states]]. In 1986, after the toppling of the most prominent Asian dictatorship, the only democratic state of its kind at the time emerged in the [[Philippines]] with the rise of [[Corazon Aquino]], who would later be known as the Mother of Asian Democracy.

The liberal trend spread to some states in Africa in the 1990s, most prominently in South Africa. Some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the [[Indonesian Revolution of 1998]], the [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|Bulldozer Revolution]] in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the [[Rose Revolution]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine, the [[Cedar Revolution]] in Lebanon, the [[Tulip Revolution]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], and the [[2010–2011 Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in [[Tunisia]].

==Theory<!--'Democratic theory' redirects here-->==

===Early theory===
[[Aristotle]] contrasted rule by the many (democracy/[[timocracy]]), with rule by the few ([[oligarchy]]/[[aristocracy]]), and with rule by a single person ([[tyranny]] or today [[autocracy]]/[[absolute monarchy]]). He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system (he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy).<ref>{{cite web|title=Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII, Chapter 10 (1160a.31-1161a.9)|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.8.viii.html|access-date=21 June 2018|publisher=Internet Classics Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aristotl.htm|title=Aristotle|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

A common view among early and renaissance [[Republicanism|Republican]] theorists was that democracy could only survive in small political communities.<ref name=":0" /> Heeding the lessons of the Roman Republic's shift to monarchism as it grew larger or smaller, these Republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny.<ref name=":0" /> Democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically, as it could only survive in small political units, which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units.<ref name=":0" /> [[Montesquieu]] famously said, "if a republic is small, it is destroyed by an outside force; if it is large, it is destroyed by an internal vice."<ref name=":0" /> [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] asserted, "It is, therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic, of middling ones to be subject to a monarch, and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince."<ref name=":0" />

===Contemporary theory===
Among modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of democracy: ''aggregative democracy'', ''[[deliberative democracy]]'', and ''[[radical democracy]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Springer|first1=Simon|year=2011|title=Public Space as Emancipation: Meditations on Anarchism, Radical Democracy, Neoliberalism and Violence|url=https://www.academia.edu/354048|journal=Antipode|volume=43|issue=2|pages=525–62|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00827.x}}</ref>

====Aggregative====
The theory of ''aggregative democracy'' claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens' preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt. Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on [[voting]], where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.

Different variants of aggregative democracy exist. Under ''minimalism'', democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not "rule" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] articulated this view most famously in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''.<ref>[[Joseph Schumpeter]], (1950). ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''. Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-133008-6}}.</ref> Contemporary proponents of minimalism include [[William H. Riker]], [[Adam Przeworski]], [[Richard Posner]].

According to the theory of [[direct democracy]], on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.

Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are [[Median voter theorem|close to the views of the median voter]]—with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. [[Anthony Downs]] suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.<ref>[[Anthony Downs]], (1957). ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. Harper Collins College. {{ISBN|0-06-041750-1}}.</ref>

[[Robert A. Dahl]] argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term [[polyarchy]] to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open [[elections]] which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.<ref>[[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl, Robert]], (1989). ''Democracy and its Critics''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-04938-2}}</ref> Similarly, [[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that "democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal."<ref>Dworkin, Ronald (2006). ''Is Democracy Possible Here?'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13872-5}}, p. 134.</ref>

====Deliberative====
''[[Deliberative democracy]]'' is based on the notion that democracy is government by [[deliberation]]. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. ''Authentic deliberation'' is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.<ref>Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2002).

====Radical====
''[[Radical democracy]]'' is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes.

===Difficulties in measuring democracy===

Because democracy is an overarching concept that includes the functioning of diverse institutions which are not easy to measure, strong limitations exist in quantifying and econometrically measuring the potential effects of democracy or its relationship with other phenomena—whether inequality, poverty, education etc.<ref name="Journal of Economic Methodology" /> Given the constraints in acquiring reliable data with within-country variation on aspects of democracy, academics have largely studied cross-country variations. Yet variations between democratic institutions are very large across countries which constrains meaningful comparisons using statistical approaches. Since democracy is typically measured aggregately as a macro variable using a single observation for each country and each year, studying democracy faces a range of econometric constraints and is limited to basic correlations. Cross-country comparison of a composite, comprehensive and qualitative concept like democracy may thus not always be, for many purposes, methodologically rigorous or useful.<ref name="Journal of Economic Methodology" />

Dieter Fuchs and Edeltraud Roller suggest that, in order to truly measure the quality of democracy, objective measurements need to be complemented by "subjective measurements based on the perspective of citizens".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fuchs |first1=Dieter |last2=Roller |first2=Edeltraud |title=Conceptualizing and Measuring the Quality of Democracy: The Citizens' Perspective |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=22 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i1.1188 |year=2018 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Similarly, Quinton Mayne and Brigitte Geißel also defend that the quality of democracy does not depend exclusively on the performance of institutions, but also on the citizens' own dispositions and commitment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mayne |first1=Quinton |last2=Geißel |first2=Brigitte |title=Don't Good Democracies Need "Good" Citizens?

==Types of governmental democracies==
{{main|Types of democracy}}

Democracy has taken a number of forms, both in theory and practice. Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others.<ref>G.F. Gaus, C. Kukathas, ''Handbook of Political Theory'', SAGE, 2004, pp.&nbsp;143–45, {{ISBN|0-7619-6787-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RGisaLxA6eMC Google Books link]</ref><ref>''The Judge in a Democracy'', Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 26, {{ISBN|0-691-12017-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC Google Books link]</ref> However, if any democracy is not structured to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the [[separation of powers]] in its favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.<ref>A. Barak, ''The Judge in a Democracy'', Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 40, {{ISBN|0-691-12017-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC Google Books link]</ref><ref>T.R.

]]

The following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another: many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co-exist in a single system.

===Basic forms===
Several variants of democracy exist, but there are two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is [[direct democracy]], in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making, for example voting on policy initiatives directly.<ref>{{cite book|author=Budge, Ian|chapter=Direct democracy|editor=Clarke, Paul A.B. |editor2=Foweraker, Joe|title=Encyclopedia of Political Thought|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-19396-2|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srzDCqnZkfUC&pg=PA224}}</ref> In most modern democracies, the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called a [[representative democracy]].

====Direct====
[[File:Landsgemeinde Glarus, 2009.jpg|thumb|A [[Landsgemeinde]] (in 2009) of the [[canton of Glarus]], an example of direct democracy in Switzerland]]
[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without needing to register, every citizen receives [[ballot papers]] and information brochures for each vote (and can send it back by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]
{{Main|Direct democracy}}

Direct democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives.  A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to:
# Change constitutional laws,
# Put forth [[initiative]]s, [[referendum]]s and suggestions for laws,
# Give binding orders to elective officials, such as revoking them before the end of their elected term or initiating a lawsuit for breaking a campaign promise.

Within modern-day representative governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens' initiatives and [[recall election]]s are referred to as forms of direct democracy.<ref>Beramendi, Virginia, and Jennifer Somalie. Angeyo. ''Direct Democracy: The International Idea Handbook''. Stockholm, Sweden: International IDEA, 2008. Print.</ref> However, some advocates of direct democracy argue for local assemblies of face-to-face discussion. Direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]],<ref name="Golay" /> the [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities]],<ref>Niels Barmeyer, ''Developing Zapatista Autonomy'', Chapter Three: Who is Running the Show?

=====Lot system=====
The use of a lot system, a characteristic of [[Athenian democracy]], is a feature of some versions of direct democracies. In this system, important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery.<ref name ="Manin 1997">{{cite journal|author=Manin, Bernard|title= Principles of Representative Government|journal= Choice Reviews Online|year=1997|volume= 35|issue= 6|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=8–11| doi = 10.5860/choice.35-3567| s2cid=153766786}}</ref>

====Representative====
{{Main|Representative democracy}}
Representative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. If the head of state is also [[Democratically elected government|democratically elected]] then it is called a democratic [[republic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REV/RADICAL.HTM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203212816/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REV/RADICAL.HTM |archive-date=3 February 1999 |title=Radical Revolution – The Thermidorean Reaction |publisher=Wsu.edu |date=6 June 1999 |access-date=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the votes. Most western countries have representative systems.<ref name="Golay" />

Representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district (or [[constituency]]), or represent the entire electorate through [[Proportional representation|proportional]] systems, with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as [[referendum]]s. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people's interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy,<ref>{{cite book| last = Köchler | first = Hans | title = The Crisis of Representative Democracy | publisher = Frankfurt/M., Bern, New York | isbn = 978-3-8204-8843-2 | year = 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Urbinati | first = Nadia | title = Representative Democracy: Principles and Genealogy | isbn = 978-0-226-84279-0 | date = 1 October 2008 | chapter = 2}}</ref> pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Fenichel Pitkin | first = Hanna | s2cid = 154048078 | title = Representation and democracy: uneasy alliance | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–42 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2004.00109.x | date = September 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Aristotle | title = Politics | volume = Book 4| chapter = Ch. 9}}</ref>

=====Parliamentary=====
{{Main|Parliamentary system}}
Parliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by or can be dismissed by, representatives as opposed to a "presidential rule" wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.<ref>Keen, Benjamin, A History of Latin America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1980.</ref><ref>Kuykendall, Ralph, Hawaii: A History. New York: Prentice Hall, 1948.</ref><ref>Brown, Charles H., The Correspondents' War. New York: Charles Scribners' Sons, 1967.</ref><ref>Taussig, Capt. J.K., "Experiences during the Boxer Rebellion," in Quarterdeck and Fo'c'sle. Chicago: Rand McNally & Company, 1963</ref>

Parliamentary systems have the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing their job to the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal.<ref name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010" /> In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies, extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the "[[loyal opposition]]". The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.

=====Presidential=====
{{Main|Presidential system}}
Presidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president by election. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren't easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.<ref name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010" />

The president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature, but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily. This provides some measure of [[separation of powers]]. In consequence, however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.<ref name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010" />

A [[semi-presidential system]] is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.<ref name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010" />

====Hybrid or semi-direct====
{{See also|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}
Some modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies, which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy, are termed ''hybrid democracies'',<ref>{{cite web |author=Garret, Elizabeth |url=http://clhc.usc.edu/centres/cslp/assets/docs/cslp-wp-048.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171009224922/http://clhc.usc.edu/centres/cslp/assets/docs/cslp-wp-048.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 October 2017 |title=The Promise and Perils of Hybrid Democracy |publisher=The Henry Lecture, University of Oklahoma Law School |date=13 October 2005 |access-date=7 August 2012 }}</ref> ''semi-direct democracies'' or ''participatory democracies''. Examples include Switzerland and some [[U.S. state]]s, where frequent use is made of [[referendum]]s and [[initiatives]].

The [[Swiss confederation]] is a semi-direct democracy.<ref name="Golay" /> At the federal level, citizens can propose changes to the constitution ([[federal popular initiative]]) or ask for a [[Optional referendum|referendum]] to be held on any law voted by the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|parliament]].<ref name="Golay" /> Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, to answer 103 questions (during the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums).<ref name="Golay" /> Although in the past 120 years less than 250 initiatives have been put to referendum. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of the initiatives put before them; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Examples include the extensive use of [[referendum]]s in the US state of [[California]], which is a state that has more than 20 million voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3985561 |title=Article on direct democracy by Imraan Buccus |publisher=Themercury.co.za |access-date=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117121519/http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3985561 |archive-date=17 January 2010}}</ref>

In [[New England]], [[Town meeting]]s are often used, especially in rural areas, to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government, with a local [[direct democracy]] and a representative state government. For example, most [[Vermont]] towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.vt.us/townmeeting/citizens_guide.html |title=A Citizen's Guide To Vermont Town Meeting |date=July 2008 |access-date=12 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805023214/http://www.sec.state.vt.us/TownMeeting/citizens_guide.html |archive-date=5 August 2012}}</ref>

===Variants===

====Constitutional monarchy====
{{main|Constitutional monarchy}}
[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen [[Elizabeth II]], a constitutional monarch]]

Many countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[Bhutan]] turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs with limited or, often gradually, merely symbolic roles. For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].<ref name="Kopstein2014" /><ref name="refNARoP" />

In other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in [[France]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]]). An elected person, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.

Elite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many states. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British [[House of Lords]]) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the [[Australian Senate]]).

====Republic====
{{Main|Republicanism}}
The term ''[[republic]]'' has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[President (government title)|president]], serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic |title=Republic – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-W.com |date=25 April 2007 |access-date=22 August 2010}}</ref>

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticised democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy, often without the protection of a constitution enshrining basic rights; [[James Madison]] argued, especially in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]], that what distinguished a direct ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.

What was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted,<ref>Novanglus, no. 7. 6 March 1775</ref> was that the government be "bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend." As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution, [[Elizabeth Willing Powel]]<ref name="Brockell">{{cite news |last1=Brockell |first1=Gillian |title='A republic, if you can keep it': Did Ben Franklin really say Impeachment Day's favorite quote? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/12/18/republic-if-you-can-keep-it-did-ben-franklin-really-say-impeachment-days-favorite-quote/ |access-date=20 January 2021 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2019-12-19 |language=en}}</ref> asked him "Well, Doctor, what have we got—a republic or a monarchy?".

====Liberal democracy====
{{main|Liberal democracy}}
A liberal democracy is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the [[rule of law]], and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities (see [[civil liberties]]).

In a liberal democracy, it is possible for some large-scale decisions to [[Emergent democracy|emerge]] from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make. In other words, citizens can "vote with their feet" or "vote with their dollars", resulting in significant informal government-by-the-masses that exercises many "powers" associated with formal government elsewhere.

====Socialist====
{{See also|Democracy in Marxism}}

[[Socialism|Socialist]] thought has several different views on democracy. [[Social democracy]], [[democratic socialism]], and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (usually exercised through [[Soviet democracy]]) are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of [[participatory democracy|participatory]], [[industrial democracy|industrial]], [[economic democracy|economic]] and/or [[workplace democracy]] combined with a [[representative democracy]].

Within [[Democracy in Marxist theory|Marxist orthodoxy]] there is a hostility to what is commonly called "liberal democracy", which is simply referred to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature. Because of orthodox Marxists' desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Leninism|Leninists]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of [[commune (Socialism)|communes]] (which are sometimes called [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]). This system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy.

====Anarchist====
[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority-rule is tyrannic or not]].  To many anarchists, the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.<ref>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''General Idea of the Revolution'' See also commentary by [[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/proudhon/grahamproudhon.html ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution'']</ref> However, [[anarcho-communist]] [[Murray Bookchin]] criticised [[individualist anarchists]] for opposing democracy,<ref>Bookchin, Murray. Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism. Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998, AK Press 1999, p. 155</ref> and says "majority rule" is consistent with anarchism.<ref>Bookchin, Murray. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/soclife.html Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]</ref>

Some anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt-in favour of a non-majoritarian form of [[consensus democracy]], similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.<ref>Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''</ref> [[Henry David Thoreau]], who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for "a better government"<ref>Thoreau, H.D. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/71/71.txt On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]''</ref> and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent.

====Sortition====
{{Main|Sortition}}
Sometimes called "democracy without elections", [[sortition]] chooses decision makers via a random process. The intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large, and be more fair and impartial than an elected official. The technique was in widespread use in [[Athenian Democracy]] and [[Republic of Florence|Renaissance Florence]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dowlen|first1=Oliver|title=The Political Potential of Sortition: A study of the random selection of citizens for public office|date=2008|publisher=Imprint Academic}}</ref> and is still used in modern [[jury selection]].

====Consociational====
{{Main|Consociational democracy}}
A consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them.

====Consensus democracy====
{{Main| Consensus democracy}}
A consensus democracy, in contrast, would not be dichotomous. Instead, decisions would be based on a multi-option approach, and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support, either in a purely verbal agreement or via a consensus vote—a multi-option preference vote. If the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level, minorities would be as it were protected automatically. Furthermore, any voting would be ethno-colour blind.

====Supranational====
[[Qualified majority voting]] is designed by the [[Treaty of Rome]] to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the [[European Council of Ministers]]. This system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. This might be seen as a form of representative democracy, but representatives to the Council might be appointed rather than directly elected.

====Inclusive====
{{Youth rights sidebar}}
{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}
Inclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for [[direct democracy]] in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, [[economic democracy]] in a [[Stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in "Towards An Inclusive Democracy" and was further developed in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.

The basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.

The citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker. Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example, to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.

====Participatory politics====
{{Main|Participatory politics}}
A [[Parpolity]] or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a [[Parpolity|Nested Council]] structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25–50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.

A council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the [[tyranny of the majority]], and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a [[participatory economy]].

====Cosmopolitan====
{{Main|Cosmopolitan democracy}}
Cosmopolitan democracy, also known as ''Global democracy'' or ''World Federalism'', is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |title=Article on Cosmopolitan democracy by Daniele Archibugi |access-date=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220629/http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2011}}</ref>

According to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing [[international organisations]], e.g. the [[United Nations]], as well as the creation of new institutions such as a [[World Parliament]], which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.

Cosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |title=letter by Einstein – "To the General Assembly of the United Nations" |access-date=2 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510174259/http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead}}, first published in United Nations World New York, Oct 1947, pp. 13–14</ref> writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist [[George Monbiot]], and professors [[David Held]] and [[Daniele Archibugi]].<ref>Daniele Archibugi & David Held, eds., ''Cosmopolitan Democracy.

Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy''], Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008</ref> The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.

====Creative democracy====
{{Main|Creative democracy}}
Creative Democracy is advocated by American philosopher [[John Dewey]]. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of "Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf |title=Creative Democracy – The Task Before Us |access-date=12 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212175652/http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf |archive-date=12 February 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a [[Morality|moral ideal]] requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. "The task of democracy", Dewey concludes, "is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute".

====Guided democracy====
{{Main|Guided democracy}}
Guided democracy is a form of democracy that incorporates regular popular elections, but which often carefully "guides" the choices offered to the electorate in a manner that may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them.  Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority.  Russian-style democracy has often been referred to as a "Guided democracy."<ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/17149/pdf Ten Years After the Soviet Breakup: From Democratization to "Guided Democracy"] Journal of Democracy. By Archie Brown. Oct. 2001. Downloaded 28 April 2017.</ref>  Russian politicians have referred to their government as having only one center of power/ authority, as opposed to most other forms of democracy which usually attempt to incorporate two or more naturally competing sources of authority within the same government.<ref>[http://www.russialist.org/archives/2009-35-32.php Putin's Rule: Its Main Features and the Current Diarchy] Johnson's [[Russia]] List. By Peter Reddaway. 18 February 2009. Downloaded 28 April 2017.</ref>

==Non-governmental democracy==
Aside from the public sphere, similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups. Many [[non-governmental organisation]]s decide policy and leadership by voting. Most [[trade union]]s and [[cooperative]]s are governed by democratic elections. [[Corporation]]s are controlled by [[shareholder]]s on the principle of [[one share, one vote]]—sometimes supplemented by [[workplace democracy]]. [[Amitai Etzioni]] has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with [[sharia law]], termed ''[[Wiktionary:Islamocracy|Islamocracy]]''.<ref>Compare: {{cite book |last1= Tibi|first1= Bassam |title= The Sharia State: Arab Spring and Democratization |date= 2013|page= 161 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uXAdAAAAQBAJ |isbn= 978-1-135-92468-3}}</ref> There is also a growing number of [[Democratic education]]al institutions such as  [[Sudbury school]]s that are co-governed by students and staff.

== Justification ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
Several justifications for democracy have been postulated.

=== Legitimacy ===
[[Social contract|Social contract theory]] argues that the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy of government]] is based on [[consent of the governed]], i.e. an election, and that political decisions must reflect the [[general will]].

=== Better decision-making ===
[[Condorcet's jury theorem]] is logical proof that if each decision-maker has a better than chance probability of making the right decision, then having the largest number of decision-makers, i.e. a democracy, will result in the best decisions. This has also been argued by theories of [[Wisdom of the crowd|the wisdom of the crowd]].

=== Democratic peace ===
[[Democratic peace theory]] claims that liberal democracies do not go to war against each other.

=== Economic success ===
In ''[[Why Nations Fail]]'', [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that democracies are more economically successful because undemocratic political systems tend to limit markets and favor [[Monopoly|monopolies]] at the expense of the [[creative destruction]] which is necessary for sustained [[economic growth]].

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of democracy}}

=== Arrow's theorem ===
[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] suggests that democracy is logically incoherent. This is based on a certain set of criteria for democratic decision-making being inherently conflicting, i.e. these three "fairness" criteria:
{{quote|
* If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
* If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
* There is no "dictator": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.
}}

[[Kenneth Arrow]] summarised the implications of the theorem in a non-mathematical form, stating that "no voting method is fair", "every ranked voting method is flawed", and "the only voting method that isn't flawed is a dictatorship".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Raghunathan |first1=Viswanathan |title=The Corruption Conundrum and Other Paradoxes and Dilemmas |date=2010 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780670083565}}</ref>

However, Arrow's formal premises can be considered overly strict, and with their reasonable weakening, the logical incoherence of democracy looks much less critical.<ref name="Tangian2020Book" />

===Inefficiencies===

Some economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy, citing the premise of the irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Democracy a Pre-Condition in Economic Growth? A Perspective from the Rise of Modern China|url=https://unchronicle.un.org/article/democracy-pre-condition-economic-growth-perspective-rise-modern-china|website=UN Chronicle|access-date=24 January 2017|archive-date=16 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316230321/https://unchronicle.un.org/article/democracy-pre-condition-economic-growth-perspective-rise-modern-china|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On the other hand, [[Socrates]] believed that democracy without educated masses (educated in the broader sense of being knowledgeable and responsible) would only lead to [[populism]] being the criteria to become an elected leader and not competence. This would ultimately lead to a societal demise. This was quoted by Plato in book 10 of The Republic, in Socrates' conversation with Adimantus.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Conversation of Socrates|first1=Plato|last2=H|first2=Translated by Spens|title=The Republic of Plato – Book ten – A conversation between Socrates and Admimantus}}</ref> Socrates was of the opinion that the right to vote must not be an indiscriminate right (for example by birth or citizenship), but must be given only to people who thought sufficiently of their choice.

===Popular rule as a façade===

The 20th-century Italian thinkers [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Gaetano Mosca]] (independently) argued that democracy was illusory, and served only to mask the reality of elite rule. Indeed, they argued that elite oligarchy is the unbendable law of human nature, due largely to the apathy and division of the masses (as opposed to the drive, initiative and unity of the elites), and that democratic institutions would do no more than shift the exercise of power from oppression to manipulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Against the masses : varieties of anti-democratic thought since the French Revolution|first=Joseph V.|last=Femia|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-828063-7|location=Oxford|oclc=46641885}}</ref> As [[Louis Brandeis]] once professed, "We may have democracy, or we may have [[wealth]] concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both."{{clarify|date=March 2018}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mr. Justice Brandeis, great American;press opinion and public appraisal|last=Dilliard|first=Irving|date=1941|publisher=Saint Louis|hdl = 2027/mdp.39015009170443}}</ref> British writer [[Ivo Mosley]], grandson of blackshirt [[Oswald Mosley]] describes in ''In the Name of the People: Pseudo-Democracy and the Spoiling of Our World'', how and why current forms of electoral governance are destined to fall short of their promise.<ref>{{cite news|work=Publishers Weekly|title=Book Review, In the Name of the People|date=3 April 2013|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781845402624}}</ref>
A study led by Princeton professor Martin Gilens of 1,779 U.S. government decisions concluded that
"elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence."<ref>"Testing theories of American politics: Elites, interest groups, and average citizens", M. Gilens and B. I. Page (2014), ''Perspectives on politics'' '''12''', 564–581, [https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf]</ref>

===Mob rule===

[[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of [[Socrates]]: "Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike."<ref>Plato, ''the Republic of Plato'' (London: J.M Dent & Sons LTD.; New York: E.P. Dutton & Co. Inc.), 558-C.</ref> In his work, Plato lists [[Plato's five regimes|5 forms of government]] from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.<ref>The contrast between Plato's theory of philosopher-kings, arresting change, and Aristotle's embrace of change is the historical tension espoused by [[Karl Raimund Popper]] in his WWII treatise, ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1943).</ref>

[[James Madison]] critiqued direct democracy (which he referred to simply as "democracy") in [[Federalist No. 10]], arguing that representative democracy—which he described using the term "republic"—is a preferable form of government, saying: "...&nbsp;democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths." Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against [[tyranny of the majority]], stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: "the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic".

===Political instability===

More recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline-grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7671283.stm | work=BBC News | title=Head to head: African democracy | date=16 October 2008 | access-date=1 April 2010}}</ref>

This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short-lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

Biased media has been accused of causing political instability, resulting in the obstruction of democracy, rather than its promotion.<ref>''The Review of Policy Research, Volume 22, Issues 1–3'', Policy Studies Organization, Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. Blackwell Publishing, 2005. p. 28</ref>

===Opposition===

{{Main|Anti-democratic thought}}
Democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government, and many times it has faced opposition from social elites. The implementation of a democratic government within a non-democratic state is typically brought about by [[democratic revolution]].

==Development==
{{main|Democratization|Democracy promotion}}
[[File:Hong Kong P1066634 (48678676473).jpg|thumb|Banner in Hong Kong asking for democracy, August 2019]]
Several philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy.

Other commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development.<ref>For example: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1951731 | author = Lipset, Seymour Martin. | s2cid = 53686238 | year = 1959 | title = Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–105 | jstor = 1951731}}</ref> In a related theory, [[Ronald Inglehart]] suggests that improved living-standards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted, leading to increased emphasis on [[self-expression values]], which correlates closely with democracy.<ref>Inglehart, Ronald. Welzel, Christian ''Modernisation, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence'', 2005.

Douglas M. Gibler and Andrew Owsiak in their study argued about the importance of peace and stable borders for the development of democracy. It has often been assumed that [[democratic peace theory|democracy causes peace]], but this study shows that, historically, peace has almost always predated the establishment of democracy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gibler |first1=Douglas M. |last2=Owsiak |first2=Andrew |title=Democracy and the Settlement of International Borders, 1919–2001 |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=62 |issue=9 |pages=1847–75 |date=2017 |doi=10.1177/0022002717708599|s2cid=158036471}}</ref>

[[Carroll Quigley]] concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy:<ref>Foreword, written by historian [http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml Harry J Hogan] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130901040610/http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml |date= 1 September 2013}} in 1982, to Quigley's ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability''</ref><ref>see also Chester G Starr, Review of ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability'', American Historical Review, Feb 1984, p. 98, available at [http://www.carrollquigley.net/book-reviews/Review-of-Weapons-Systems-Political-Stability-Starr.htm carrollquigley.net]</ref> Democracy—this scenario—tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use.<ref name="Quigley1983-38" /> By the 1800s, guns were the best personal weapons available, and in the United States of America (already nominally democratic), almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily.

Other theories stressed the relevance of [[education]] and of [[human capital]]—and within them of [[intelligence|cognitive ability]] to increasing tolerance, rationality, political literacy and participation.

One possible mediator of these relationships is the attainment of higher stages of moral judgment fostered by cognitive ability, which is necessary for the function of democratic rules in society. The other mediators for citizens as well as for leaders could be the increased competence and willingness to process and seek information necessary for political decisions due to greater cognitive ability.

* an ethical effect (support of democratic values, freedom, human rights etc.), which itself depends on intelligence.

Evidence consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Statistical analyses have challenged [[modernisation theory]] by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Albertus |first1= Michael |first2= Victor |last2= Menaldo |s2cid= 153949862 |title= Coercive Capacity and the Prospects for Democratisation |journal= Comparative Politics |volume= 44 |issue= 2 |year= 2012 |pages= 151–69 |doi= 10.5129/001041512798838003}}</ref> In fact, empirical evidence shows that economic growth and education may not lead to increased demand for democratization as modernization theory suggests: historically, most countries attained high levels of access to primary education well before transitioning to democracy.<ref name="Paglayan 179–198">{{Cite journal|last=Paglayan|first=Agustina S.|date=February 2021|title=The Non-Democratic Roots of Mass Education: Evidence from 200 Years|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=115|issue=1|pages=179–198|doi=10.1017/S0003055420000647|issn=0003-0554|doi-access=free}}</ref> Rather than acting as a catalyst for democratization, in some situations education provision may instead be used by non-democratic regimes to indoctrinate their subjects and strengthen their power.<ref name="Paglayan 179–198"/>

The assumed link between education and economic growth is called into question when analyzing empirical evidence. Across different countries, the correlation between education attainment and math test scores is very weak (.07). A similarly weak relationship exists between per-pupil expenditures and math competency (.26). Additionally, historical evidence suggests that average human capital (measured using literacy rates) of the masses does not explain the onset of industrialization in France from 1750 to 1850 despite arguments to the contrary.<ref>Squicciarini, Mara and Voigtländer, Nico, Knowledge Elites and Modernization: Evidence from Revolutionary France (October 2016). NBER Working Paper No. w22779, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2861711</ref> Together, these findings show that education does not always promote human capital and economic growth as is generally argued to be the case. Instead, the evidence implies that education provision often falls short of its expressed goals, or, alternatively, that political actors use education to promote goals other than economic growth and development.

Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on "[[the Resource Curse]]" that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.plawlotic.com/?p=8 | title= The Resource Curse: Does the Emperor Have no Clothes?}}</ref> The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the "deep" determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic.<ref>{{cite book |title= Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy |last1= Acemoglu |first1= Daron |author-link1= Daron Acemoglu |first2= James A. |last2= Robinson |year= 2006 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-85526-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.plawlotic.com/?p=102 | title= Rainfall and Democracy}}</ref> More inclusive [[institution]]s lead to democracy because as people gain more power, they are able to demand more from the elites, who in turn have to concede more things to keep their position.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This virtuous circle may end up in democracy.

An example of this is the disease environment. Places with different mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world. For example, in Africa, the [[tsetse fly]]—which afflicts humans and livestock—reduced the ability of Africans to plow the land. This made Africa less settled. As a consequence, political power was less concentrated.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Alsan, Marcella|doi= 10.1257/aer.20130604|url= https://www.dartmouth.edu/~neudc2012/docs/paper_285.pdf|year= 2015|title= The Effect of the TseTse Fly on African Development|journal= American Economic Review|volume= 105|issue= 1|pages= 382–410|citeseerx= 10.1.1.1010.2955}}</ref> This also affected the colonial institutions European countries established in Africa.<ref>{{cite book|author1= Acemoglu, Daron |author2=Johnson, Simon |author3=Robinson, James |year= 2005|chapter= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth |title= Handbook of Economic Growth |volume= 1|pages= 385–472, Sections 1 to 4|doi= 10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|series= Handbook of Economic Growth|isbn= 978-0-444-52041-8}}</ref> Whether colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths.

An example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers. This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of [[trade]].<ref>Mellinger, Andrew D., Jeffrey Sachs, and John L. Gallup. (1999).

In the 21st century, democracy has become such a popular method of reaching decisions that its application beyond politics to other areas such as entertainment, food and fashion, consumerism, urban planning, education, art, literature, science and theology has been criticised as "the reigning dogma of our time".<ref>{{cite news |last= Farrelly |first= Elizabeth |author-link= Elizabeth Farrelly |title= Deafened by the roar of the crowd |url= http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/deafened-by-roar-of-the-crowd-20110914-1k9lo.html |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date= 17 September 2011 |date= 15 September 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111230084034/http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/deafened-by-roar-of-the-crowd-20110914-1k9lo.html |archive-date= 30 December 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The argument suggests that applying a populist or market-driven approach to art and literature (for example), means that innovative creative work goes unpublished or unproduced. In education, the argument is that essential but more difficult studies are not undertaken. Science, as a [[truth]]-based discipline, is particularly corrupted by the idea that the correct conclusion can be arrived at by popular vote. However, more recently, theorists{{which|date=August 2018}} have also advanced the concept [[epistemic democracy]] to assert that democracy actually does a good job tracking the truth.

Robert Michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised, democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy:

<blockquote>The peasant in the fable, when on his deathbed, tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field. After the old man's death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure. They do not find it. But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative well-being. The treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy.<ref>{{cite book |author= Robert Michels |title= Political Parties |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ijae_UIez38C |access-date =5 June 2013 |date= 1999 |orig-year= 1962 by [[Collier's|Crowell-Collier]] |publisher= [[Transaction Publishers]] |isbn= 978-1-4128-3116-1 |page= 243}}</ref></blockquote>

Dr. [[Harald Wydra]], in his book ''Communism and The Emergence of Democracy'' (2007), maintains that the development of democracy should not be viewed as a purely procedural or as a static concept but rather as an ongoing "process of meaning formation".<ref>Harald Wydra, Communism and the Emergence of Democracy, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 22–27.</ref> Drawing on Claude Lefort's idea of the empty place of power, that "power emanates from the people [...] but is the power of nobody", he remarks that democracy is reverence to a symbolic mythical authority—as in reality, there is no such thing as the people or ''demos''. Democratic political figures are not supreme rulers but rather temporary guardians of an empty place. Any claim to substance such as the [[collective good]], the [[public interest]] or the will of the nation is subject to the competitive struggle and times of for{{clarify|date=January 2016}} gaining the authority of office and government. The essence of the democratic system is an empty place, void of real people, which can only be temporarily filled and never be appropriated. The seat of power is there but remains open to constant change. As such, people's definitions of "democracy" or of "democratic" progress throughout history as a continual and potentially never-ending process of social construction.<ref>Compare: {{cite book | last1 = Wydra | first1 = Harald | author-link1 = Harald Wydra | chapter = Democracy as a process of meaning-formation | title = Communism and the Emergence of Democracy | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pQDwFB-k2LcC | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | pages = 244–68 | isbn = 978-1-139-46218-1 | access-date = 11 August 2018 | year =2007}}</ref>

==Disruption==
Some democratic governments have experienced sudden [[state collapse]] and [[regime change]] to an undemocratic form of government. Domestic military coups or rebellions are the most common means by which democratic governments have been overthrown.<ref name="Siaroff">{{cite book |title=Comparing Political Regimes: A Thematic Introduction to Comparative Politics |author=Alan Siaroff |isbn=9781442600126 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2009 |page=285}}</ref> (See [[List of coups and coup attempts by country]] and [[List of civil wars]].) Examples include the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] that ended the [[First French Republic]], and the [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]] which ended the [[First Portuguese Republic]]. Some military coups are supported by foreign governments, such as the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]] and the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]]. Other types of a sudden end to democracy include:
* [[Invasion]], for example the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], and the fall of [[South Vietnam]].
* [[Self-coup]], in which the leader of the government extra-legally seizes all power or unlawfully extends the term in office. This can be done through:
** Suspension of the constitution by decree, such as with the [[1992 Peruvian coup d'état]]
** An "electoral self-coup" using [[election fraud]] to obtain re-election of a previously fairly elected official or political party. For example, in the [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election]], [[2003 Russian legislative election]], and [[2004 Russian presidential election]].<ref name="Siaroff" />
* [[Royal coup]], in which a monarch not normally involved in government seizes all power. For example, the [[6 January Dictatorship]], begun in 1929 when King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] dismissed parliament and started ruling by decree.

[[Democratic backsliding]] can end democracy in a gradual manner, by increasing emphasis on [[national security]] and eroding [[free and fair election]]s, [[freedom of expression]], [[independence of the judiciary]], [[rule of law]].  A famous example is the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which lawfully ended democracy in [[Weimar Germany]] and marked the transition to [[Nazi Germany]].

Temporary or long-term [[political violence]] and government interference can prevent [[free and fair election]]s, which erode the democratic nature of governments. This has happened on a local level even in well-established democracies like the United States; for example, the [[Wilmington insurrection of 1898]] and African-American [[disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era]].

== Importance of mass media ==
{{Further|topic=the role of the mass media in the democratic process|Mediatization (media)}}

The theory of democracy relies on the implicit assumption that voters are well informed about [[social issue]]s, policies, and candidates so that they can make a truly informed decision. Since the late 20'th century there has been a growing concern that voters may be poorly informed because the [[news media]] are focusing more on entertainment and gossip and less on serious journalistic research on political issues.<ref name="MacChesney1999">{{cite book |last1=MacChesney |first1=Robert W |title=Rich media, poor democracy: Communication politics in dubious times |date=1999 |publisher=University of Illinois Press}}</ref><ref name="Barnett2002">{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=Steven |title=Will a crisis in journalism provoke a crisis in democracy? |journal=The Political Quarterly |date=2002 |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=400–408|doi=10.1111/1467-923X.00494 }}</ref>

The media professors Michael Gurevitch and [[Jay Blumler]] have proposed a number of functions that the mass media are expected to fulfill in a democracy:<ref name="GurevitchBlumler1990">{{cite book |last1=Gurevitch |first1=Michael |last2=Blumler |first2=Jay G. |editor1-last=Lichtenberg |editor1-first=Judith |title=Democracy and the mass media: A collection of essays |date=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=269–289 |chapter=Political Communication Systems and Democratic Values}}</ref>

* Surveillance of the sociopolitical environment
* Meaningful [[agenda setting]]
* Platforms for an intelligible and illuminating advocacy
* Dialogue across a diverse range of views
* Mechanisms for holding officials to account for how they have exercised power
* Incentives for citizens to learn, choose, and become involved
* A principled resistance to the efforts of forces outside the media to subvert their independence, integrity, and ability to serve the audience
* A sense of respect for the audience member, as potentially concerned and able to make sense of his or her political environment

The [[Tabloid journalism|tabloidization]] and popularization of the news media is seen in an increasing focus on human examples rather than statistics and principles.

This is often seen as an advantage for democracy.<ref name="Schulz2014">{{cite book |last1=Schulz|first1=Winfried|editor1-last=Esser |editor1-first=Frank |editor2-last=Strömbäck |editor2-first=Jesper |title=Mediatization of politics: Understanding the transformation of Western democracies |chapter=Mediatization and New Media |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |pages=114–136}}</ref> 
The new possibilities for communication have fundamentally changed the way [[social movement]]s and [[protest movements]] operate and organize. The internet and social media have provided powerful new tools for democracy movements in developing countries and [[emerging democracies]], enabling them to bypass [[censorship]], voice their opinions, and organize protests.<ref name="Zhuravskaya2020">{{cite journal |last1=Zhuravskaya |first1=Ekaterina |last2=Petrova |first2=Maria |last3=Enikolopov |first3=Ruben |title=Political effects of the internet and social media |journal=Annual Review of Economics |date=2020 |volume=12 |pages=415–438|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-081919-050239 |s2cid=219769484 }}</ref><ref name="Voltmer2019">{{cite book |last1=Voltmer |first1=Katrin |last2=Sorensen |first2=Lone |editor1-last=Voltmer |editor1-first=Katrin |display-editors=etal|title=Media, Communication and the Struggle for Democratic Change |date=2019 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=35–58 |chapter=Media, Power, Citizenship: The Mediatization of Democratic Change}}</ref>

A serious problem with the social media is that they have no truth filters. The established news media have to guard their reputation as trustworthy, while ordinary citizens may post unreliable information.<ref name="Zhuravskaya2020" /> In fact, studies show that false stories are going more [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] than true stories.<ref name="Vosoughi2018">{{cite journal |last1=Vosoughi |first1=Soroush |last2=Roy |first2=Deb |last3=Aral |first3=Sinan |title=The spread of true and false news online |journal=Science |date=2018 |volume=359 |issue=6380 |pages=1146–1151|doi=10.1126/science.aap9559 |pmid=29590045 |bibcode=2018Sci...359.1146V |s2cid=4549072 |url=http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/share/papershredder/vosoughi2018a.pdf }}</ref><ref name="Prooijen2021">{{cite journal |last1=Prooijen |first1=Jan-Willem van |last2=Ligthart |first2=Joline |last3=Rosema |first3=Sabine |title=The entertainment value of conspiracy theories |journal=British Journal of Psychology |date=2021 |doi=10.1111/bjop.12522|pmid=34260744 |doi-access=free }}</ref> 
The proliferation of false stories and [[conspiracy theories]] may undermine public trust in the political system and public officials.<ref name="Prooijen2021" /><ref name="McCoySomer2019" />

Reliable information sources are essential for the democratic process. Less democratic governments rely heavily on [[censorship]], [[propaganda]], and [[misinformation]] in order to stay in power, while independent sources of information are able to undermine their legitimacy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Egorov |first1=Georgy |last2=Sonin |first2=Konstantin |title=The political economics of non-democracy |date=2020 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |location=NBER Working Paper No. w27949 |url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3714441}}</ref>
