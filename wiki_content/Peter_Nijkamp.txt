He has honorary doctorates from the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] and the [[National Technical University of Athens]].

==Controversy==
In 2013, the PhD thesis of one of his students was withdrawn one day before the scheduled defence. It consisted almost entirely of papers jointly written with Nijkamp. An internal investigation at the VU determined that some of these papers were recycled versions of yet earlier papers, with other co-authors, who had not been cited properly and this might be considered a form of plagiarism. The VU's rector, Frank van der Duyn Schouten, stated that Nijkamp had acted improperly but had not committed plagiarism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5288/Onderwijs/article/detail/3573444/2014/01/07/Rector-VU-wat-Nijkamp-deed-was-geen-diefstal.dhtml|title=Rector VU: wat Nijkamp deed, was geen diefstal|last=Sahadat|first=Ianthe|date=7 January 2014|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> The student involved was allowed to adapt the thesis and the graduation ceremony took place in 2014.

Following extensive press reports that claimed to have found cases of self-plagiarism in Nijkamp's work<ref name="remie">{{cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/01/07/vier-voorbeelden-van-het-zelfplagiaat-van-topeconoom-nijkamp/|title=Vier voorbeelden van het (zelf)plagiaat van topeconoom Nijkamp - nrc.nl|last=Remie|first=Mirjam|date=7 January 2014|work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5288/Onderwijs/article/detail/3573858/2014/01/08/Onderzoek-60-procent-publicaties-VU-econoom-bevat-zelfplagiaat.dhtml|title=Onderzoek: 60 procent publicaties VU-econoom bevat 'zelfplagiaat'|date=8 January 2014|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> and an analysis by an anonymous whistleblower, the VU announced it would investigate Nijkamp's entire publishing record.<ref>[http://www.observantonline.nl/English/Home/Articles/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2057/VU-investigates-plagiarism-by-Nijkamp VU investigates plagiarism by Nijkamp], observantonline.nl, retrieved 8 November 2015.</ref> It would also inquire with the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] on the boundary between self-plagiarism and "self-citation".

The investigation committee concluded in March 2015 that Nijkamp had re-used earlier publications in new papers on a certain scale, without proper referencing and the committee qualified this as "questionable research practice".<ref name="AV15" /> The VU accepted some, but not all, of the committee conclusions.<ref name="AV15" /> In a separate investigation the Dutch National Board on Research Integrity found Nijkamp "careless" but not in breach of scientific integrity. It also found university regulations on self-citation insufficient at the time.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.advalvas.vu.nl/nieuws/integriteitsorgaan-vu-onzorgvuldig-gehandeld-zaak-nijkamp Integriteitsorgaan: 'VU onzorgvuldig gehandeld in zaak Nijkamp'], ''Advalvas'', 11 March 2015.</ref> Nijkamp himself stated that the investigation committee's methodology and selection of publications is too thin a base for any conclusions.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nijkamp-response.pdf ‘Zelfplagiaat’-rapport van de Commissie-Zwemmer: Broddelwerk over fictieve peanuts], Nijkamp's response, via retractionwatch.com, retrieved 8 November 2015.</ref>
