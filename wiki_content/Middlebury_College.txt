Middlebury is known for progressive teaching and thought. The college was the first American institution of higher education to award a bachelor's degree to an African-American, graduating [[Alexander Twilight]] in the class of 1823.<ref name="Twilight">{{cite web |url=http://oldstonehousemuseum.org/twilight-bio |title=Alexander Twilight |publisher=Old Stone House Museum |access-date=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ag2yq7YE?url=http://oldstonehousemuseum.org/twilight-bio |archive-date=2012-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> Middlebury was also one of the first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in [[New England]] to become a [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] institution, following the trustees' decision in 1883 to accept women. In 1965, the college established the first undergraduate [[Environmental Studies]] program in the United States, and, in 2019, publicly committed to full divestment of the college's endowment from the fossil fuel industry through its Energy2028 initiative.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-29|title=Middlebury Announces Energy2028 Plan to Address Threat of Climate Change|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2019-news/node/611978|access-date=2021-01-16|website=Middlebury|language=en}}</ref>

Middlebury received its founding charter on November 1, 1800, as an outgrowth of the ''Addison County Grammar School'', which had been founded three years earlier in 1797. The college's first president—[[Jeremiah Atwater]]—began classes a few days later, making Middlebury the first operating college or university in Vermont.<ref name=":1">W.L. Kingsley et al., "The College and the Church," ''New Englander and Yale Review'' '''11''' (Feb 1858): 600.

It issued the first Vermont degree in 1802; [[University of Vermont]] followed in 1804.</ref> One student named Aaron Petty graduated at the first commencement held in August 1802.<ref name="CollegeCampus" /> The college's founding religious affiliation was loosely [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]]. Yet the idea for a college was that of town fathers rather than clergymen, and Middlebury was clearly "the Town's College" rather than the Church's. Chief among its founders were [[Seth Storrs]] and [[Gamaliel Painter]], the former credited with the idea for a college<ref name="VermontHistorySumFal01">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Firm |url=http://www.vermonthistory.org/journal/69/vt693_402.pdf |title=Seth Storrs, Congregationalism, and the Founding of Middlebury College |work=Vermont History |date=Summer–Fall 2001 |access-date=2012-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204095609/http://www.vermonthistory.org/journal/69/vt693_402.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the latter as its greatest early benefactor. In addition to receiving a diploma upon graduation, Middlebury graduates also receive a replica of Gamaliel Painter's cane. Painter bequeathed his original cane to the college and it is carried by the college President at official occasions including first-year convocation and graduation. [[Alexander Twilight]], class of 1823, was the first black graduate of any college or university in the United States; he also became the first African American elected to public office, joining the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] in 1836. At its second commencement in 1804, Middlebury granted [[Lemuel Haynes]] an [[Honorary degree|honorary master's degree]], the first [[Master of Arts|advanced degree]] ever bestowed upon an African American.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2p29.html Africans in America/Part 2/Lemuel Haynes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824095504/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2p29.html |date=2017-08-24 }}.

In 1883, the trustees voted to accept women as students in the college, making Middlebury one of the first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in New England to become a coeducational institution. The first female graduate—May Belle Chellis—received her degree in 1886.<ref>[http://go.middlebury.edu/chellis Chellis House | Middlebury]. Go.middlebury.edu.

The college's centennial in 1900 began a century of physical expansion beyond the three buildings of [[Old Stone Row]]. [[York and Sawyer]] designed the Egbert Starr Library (1900), a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] edifice later expanded and renamed the Axinn Center, and Warner Hall (1901). Growth in enrollment and the endowment led to continued expansion westward. McCullough Hall (1912) and Voter Hall (1913) featured gymnasium and laboratories, respectively, adopting Georgian Revival styling while confirming the campus standard of grey Vermont limestone, granite, and marble.<ref name="CollegeCampus">{{cite web |url=http://midddigital.middlebury.edu/walking_history/college_campus/page_3.html |title=The College Campus |publisher=A Walking History of Middlebury |access-date=2012-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302111625/http://midddigital.middlebury.edu/walking_history/college_campus/page_3.html |archive-date=2012-03-02 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The national fraternity [[Kappa Delta Rho]] was founded in Painter Hall on May 17, 1905. Middlebury College abolished fraternities in the early 1990s, but the organization continued on campus in the less ritualized form of a social house. Due to a policy at the school against single-sex organizations, the house was forced to coeducate during the same period as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kdr.com/main.php|title=National Fraternity of Kappa Delta Rho|access-date=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310185738/http://www.kdr.com/main.php|archive-date=10 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The German Language School, founded in 1915 under the supervision of then-President [[John Martin Thomas]], began the tradition of the [[Middlebury College Language Schools]].

==Academics==
[[File:Middlebury VT - Middlebury College.jpg|left|thumb|Old Chapel, completed in 1836, served as Middlebury's primary academic building for a century]]
Founded in 1800, the college enrolls approximately 2,500 undergraduates from all 50 states and 70 countries. The college offers 40 undergraduate departments and programs. Middlebury was the first institution of higher education in the United States to offer an [[environmental studies]] major, establishing the major in 1965.<ref name="ES-About the Program"/> Middlebury College is [[Higher education accreditation in the United States|accredited]] by the [[New England Commission of Higher Education]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Vermont Institutions – NECHE|publisher=[[New England Commission of Higher Education]]|url=https://www.neche.org/institutions/vt/|access-date=May 26, 2021}}</ref>

The most popular majors at Middlebury by number of recent graduates are: [[economics]], [[international studies]], [[literature|English and American literatures]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[environmental studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/about/president/addresses/archive/bacc_2010|title=Baccalaureate 2010|publisher=Middlebury|access-date=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603000533/http://www.middlebury.edu/about/president/addresses/archive/bacc_2010|archive-date=3 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Close to 40 percent of graduating seniors choose a single major in a traditional academic discipline, and about 30 percent of students complete a double or joint major combining two disciplines. Another 30 percent of students major in one of the college's interdisciplinary programs.<ref>{{cite web| title=Undergraduate Majors & Programs| url=http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/ump/| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214073154/http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/ump/| archive-date=2008-02-14}}</ref>

The academic year follows a 4–1–4 schedule of two four-course semesters in the autumn and spring plus a what is known as a "Winter Term" session in January. The Winter Term, often called "J-Term" for January Term, allows students to enroll in one intensive course, pursue independent research, or complete an off-campus internship. Winter Term courses are taught by a mix of traditional faculty and special instructors.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.middlebury.edu/admissions/aap/handbook/academicinformation/node/293569|title = The 4-1-4 Calendar Year and Winter Term|access-date = 2015-12-18|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171859/http://www.middlebury.edu/admissions/aap/handbook/academicinformation/node/293569|archive-date = 2015-12-22|url-status = live}}</ref>

===Language schools===
{{Main|Middlebury College Language Schools}}

The Middlebury College Language Schools, which began with the establishment of the School of German in 1915, offer intensive instruction in 10 languages during six-, seven-, or eight-week summer sessions. The schools enroll about 1,350 students every summer. The Schools all use an [[language immersion|immersion]]-based approach to language instruction and acquisition. All students in the Language Schools must sign and abide by Middlebury's "''Language Pledge''," a pledge to use their target language exclusively during the duration of their time at the School.<ref name="Language Pledge">{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/ls/approach/pledge|title=Language Pledge|publisher=Middlebury|access-date=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302043757/http://www.middlebury.edu/ls/approach/pledge|archive-date=2 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Middlebury's Language Schools have historically been conducted at the college's campus in Vermont. In the summer of 2009 the college opened a satellite campus at [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]] to accommodate a growth in enrollment. For the summer of 2011, Middlebury at Mills will offer Arabic, French, Japanese, and Spanish instruction. Since the summer of 2015, Mills College in Oakland hosts the newly founded Middlebury School of Korean (2015), as well as the School of Arabic and the School of Italian.

 }}The {{Convert|350|acre|km2||adj=mid}} main campus is located in the [[Champlain Valley]] between [[Vermont]]'s [[Green Mountains (Vermont)|Green Mountains]] to the east and [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Adirondack Mountains]] to the west. The campus is situated on a hill to the west of the village of [[Middlebury (town), Vermont|Middlebury]], a traditional [[New England]] village centered on [[Otter Creek (Vermont)|Otter Creek]] Falls.

Middlebury's campus is characterized by quads and open spaces, views of the Green Mountains and the Adirondacks, and historic granite, marble, and limestone buildings. ''[[Old Stone Row]]'', consisting of the three oldest buildings on campus—Old Chapel, Painter Hall, and Starr Hall—is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Painter Hall, constructed in 1815, is the oldest extant college building in Vermont. [[Emma Willard House]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], hosts the admissions office.

Since the mid-1990s, student housing has been grouped into five residential Commons: [[Jeremiah Atwater|Atwater]], [[Ezra Brainerd|Brainerd]], Cook, Ross, and Wonnacott. All are named for illustrious college figures. The creation of the Commons accompanied an increase in the size of the student body and an ambitious building campaign. Many new campus advancements include:
* {{convert|220000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[John McCardell Jr.]] Bicentennial Hall, a multidisciplinary science facility built to house the [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biochemistry]], [[Computer Science]], [[Geography]], [[Geology]], [[Physics]], and [[Psychology]] departments as well as the [[Environmental Studies]], [[Neuroscience]], and [[Molecular Biology]] programs (1999)

* Hillcrest Environmental Center, an [[Italianate|Italianate-style]] farmhouse constructed around 1874, has been renovated to provide a home for the environmental studies program according to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] standards (2007)
* Starr Library, a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] edifice completed in 1900, now hosts the Donald Everett Axinn '51 Center for Literary and Cultural Studies at Starr Library after significant restoration of interior spaces and the addition of two wings for faculty offices, lecture halls, and a video production studio (2008)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/administration/fs/planning/construction/axinn/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830081749/http://www.middlebury.edu/administration/fs/planning/construction/axinn/|url-status=dead|title=Axinn Center|archive-date=August 30, 2008}}</ref>
In the fall of 1994 the President and Board of Trustees of Middlebury College adopted a "One Percent for Art" policy. This decision set aside one percent of the cost of any renovation or new construction at the college for the purchase, installation, maintenance, and interpretation of works of art publicly displayed on campus. There are 19 works in Middlebury's campus public art collection, including ''[[Frisbee (sculpture)|Frisbee]],'' [[George Rickey]]'s ''[[Two Open Rectangles, Excentric, Variation VI (sculpture)|Two Open Rectangles, Excentric, Variation VI]],'' [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]]'s ''[[Smog (1/3)|Smog]]'', and a version of [[Robert Indiana]]'s ''[[Love (sculpture)|Love]]'' series.

The mountain campus is the site of the Middlebury College Snow Bowl, the college-owned ski mountain, and the Carroll and Jane Rikert Ski Touring Center. Along with the [[Dartmouth Skiway]], the Snow Bowl is one of two remaining college-owned ski areas in the eastern United States. A volunteer [[ski patrol]], staffed by students, provides on-mountain medical services. Members are certified as [[Outdoor Emergency Care]] technicians and trained in first aid, chairlift evacuation, and toboggan handling. The Middlebury College Snow Bowl is host to ski races during the annual Middlebury Winter Carnival as well as the February mid-year graduation.

In 2010, the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] and Middlebury College announced the creation of the Sustainable Investments Initiative, a co-mingled fiscal vehicle seeking investments that generate long-term social, environmental, and economic value. The Initiative will seek investments focused specifically on sustainability issues such as clean energy, water, climate science, and green building projects, in an effort to identify businesses positioned to become a part of the worldwide shift to improve energy efficiency, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate the effects of global climate change.<ref>{{cite web| title=Middlebury and Rockefeller Brothers Fund Sustainable Investments Initiative| url=http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/node/255685/| access-date=2010-06-01| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528183123/http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/node/255685| archive-date=2010-05-28| url-status=live}}</ref>

Also in 2010, Middlebury College and Integrated Energy Solutions, a Vermont developer of farm-based methane energy, agreed to explore a bio-methane gas collection and delivery system that could help Middlebury further reduce its use of fossil fuels. Middlebury has agreed to purchase bio-methane gas from IES over a 10-year period, with the agreement contingent on the college raising money to build storage facilities for the gas on campus and retrofit its current heating plant to burn the new fuel.<ref>{{cite web

Following the New Traditions Contest initiated by President Laurie Patton in the spring of 2018, Middlebury held its first Panther Day on October 20, 2018. The new tradition was held during Homecoming Weekend and included a parade of student clubs and organizations, in an effort to build school spirit. A group of student protesters lined the side of the parade route to call attention to the lack of support by the college for survivors of sexual assault. Protesters silently held signs with phrases including “We believe survivors, Midd should too” and “Green Dot is not enough” (Green Dot refers to a College initiative to train students to intervene in situations of potential sexual violence, specifically focused on parties as sites of sexual violence).<ref>{{Citation|last=PATCH|first=EMMA|title=Panther Day: Midd in Two Forms|url=https://middleburycampus.com/40859/news/panther-day-midd-in-two-forms/|access-date=2019-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107002400/https://middleburycampus.com/40859/news/panther-day-midd-in-two-forms/|archive-date=2018-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref>

===''New England Review''===
{{Main|New England Review}}
The ''New England Review'' (''NER'') is a quarterly literary journal published by Middlebury College. Founded in New Hampshire in 1978 by poet, novelist, editor and professor [[Sydney Lea]] and poet [[Jay Parini]], it was published as ''New England Review & Bread Loaf Quarterly'' from 1982 (when it moved to Middlebury College), until 1991 as a formal division of the [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]]. In 1991, the magazine reverted to its original name, ''New England Review'', and opted to have only informal ties with the Writers' Conference.

''NER'' publishes poetry, fiction, translations, and a wide variety of non-fiction in each issue. ''NER'' consistently publishes work from established writers as well as work from up-and-coming new writers. It has published work by many who have gone on to win major awards such as the [[Pulitzer Prize]], the [[National Book Award]], and the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]].<ref>[http://go.middlebury.edu/nereview New England Review].
