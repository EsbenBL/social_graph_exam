'''Lawrence Alan Kudlow''' (born August 20, 1947) is an American conservative television personality and financial program host for Fox network who served as the Director of the [[National Economic Council (United States)|National Economic Council]] during the [[Trump Administration]] from 2018 to 2021. He assumed that role after his previous employment as a CNBC television financial news host.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/26/archives/june-16-bridal-set-by-nancy-gerstein.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=June 16 Bridal Set |first=Nancy |last=Gerstein |date=May 26, 1974}}</ref><ref name=replace>{{cite news |author1=Jacob Pramuk |author2=Eamon Javers |title=Larry Kudlow to replace Gary Cohn as Trump's top economic advisor |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/trump-to-name-larry-kudlow-as-gary-cohn-replacement.html |access-date=January 7, 2021 |work=CNBC |date=March 14, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> He held a corporate title of "economist" in the 1980s, though he is not formally educated in economics.

Kudlow began his career as a junior financial analyst at the [[New York Federal Reserve]]. He soon left government to work on [[Wall Street]] at [[Paine Webber]] and [[Bear Stearns]] as a [[financial analyst]]. In 1981, after previously volunteering and working for [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] politicians and causes, Kudlow joined the administration of [[Ronald Reagan]] as associate director for economics and planning in the [[Office of Management and Budget]].<ref name="nytref1" />

After leaving the Reagan Administration during the second term, Kudlow returned to Wall Street and Bear Stearns, serving as the firm's [[chief of staff|chief]] [[economist]] from 1987 until 1994. During this time, he also advised the gubernatorial campaign of [[Christine Todd Whitman]] on economic issues. In the late 1990s, after a publicized battle with cocaine and alcohol [[addiction]], Kudlow left Wall Street to become an economic media commentator{{snd}}first with ''[[National Review]]'', and later hosting several shows on [[CNBC]].

==Early life==
Kudlow was born and raised in [[New Jersey]], the son of Ruth (née Grodnick) and Irving Howard Kudlow.<ref>{{cite book|title=International Who's Who, 1983–84|date=1983|publisher=Europa Publications Limited|isbn=9780905118864|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xJ4R0t9G3oC}}</ref> His family is [[Jewish]]. He attended the [[Elisabeth Morrow School]] in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], until the sixth grade. He then attended the [[Dwight-Englewood School]] through high school.<ref>"The Interview: Lawrence Kudlow", from ''[[The American Spectator]]'', March 2001. "I remember that in this little prep school that I went to, the Dwight Englewood School in New Jersey, we had to say the Lord's Prayer in homeroom."</ref>

He graduated from the [[University of Rochester]] in [[Rochester, New York]], with a bachelor's degree in history in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V65N2/feature5.html |title=Rochester Review: The Optimist Reigns Again |publisher=Rochester.edu |access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> Although he completed only an undergraduate degree (aside from his foreign policy coursework at Princeton), he claims that his particular history curriculum dealt heavily with themes in economics, especially trade policy.<ref name="nytref1"/>

In 1971, Kudlow enrolled in the master's program at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], but he left before completing his degree.<ref name="Andrews1995">{{cite magazine |last1=Andrews |first1=Suzanna |title=The Hollow Man |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |issue=44 |date=November 6, 1995 |volume=28 |pages=34–40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1970, while he was still a Democrat, Kudlow joined [[Americans for Democratic Action]] chair [[Joseph Duffey]]'s "New Politics" senatorial campaign in Connecticut which also attracted an "A-list crowd of young Democrats", including [[Yale University]] law student [[Bill Clinton]], [[John Podesta]], and [[Michael Medved]], another future conservative. Duffey was a leading [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war politician during the Vietnam war era]]. Duffey's campaign manager called Kudlow a "brilliant organizer".<ref name="Andrews1995"/> In 1976, he worked on the U.S. Senate campaign of [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], along with [[Tim Russert]], against [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]], brother of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Right Turns: Unconventional Lessons from a Controversial Life|last=Medved|first=Michael|publisher=Crown Forum|year=2004|isbn=1-4000-5187-8|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/rightturnsunconv00medv/page/131 131]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rightturnsunconv00medv/page/131}}</ref>

Kudlow began his career as a staff economist at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], taking a position "as a junior economist in a job where a master's degree wasn't required".<ref name="Andrews1995" /> He worked in the division of the Fed that handled [[open market operations]].

During the first term of the [[Reagan administration]] (1981–1985), Kudlow was associate director for economics and planning in the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), a part of the [[Executive Office of the President]]. In April 2005, New York Governor [[George Pataki]] included Kudlow in a six-member state tax commission.

Kudlow's name was floated by Republicans as a potential Senate candidate in either [[United States Senate election in Connecticut, 2016|Connecticut]] or [[United States Senate election in New York, 2016|New York]] in [[United States Senate elections, 2016|2016]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/420242/larry-kudlow-nrsc-senate-bid-ny-ct|title=Larry Kudlow and NRSC Renew Discussions on Senate Run|last=Johnson|first=Eliana|date=June 24, 2015|work=[[National Review]]|access-date=June 25, 2015}}</ref> In October 2015, U.S. Senator [[Richard Blumenthal]], in an email to supporters, attacked Kudlow as "a champion of big corporations and big money" despite Kudlow's not announcing a run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctmirror.org/2015/11/04/blumenthal-campaign-targets-potential-rival-kudlow-over-actual-candidate-wolf/|title=Blumenthal campaign targets potential rival Kudlow over actual candidate Wolf|website=Ctmirror.org|date=November 4, 2015|access-date=October 20, 2017}}</ref> In early December 2015, [[Jack Fowler (publisher)|Jack Fowler]] of ''[[National Review]]'' created a 527 organization that encouraged Kudlow to run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/connecticut/weston-ct/redding-resident-being-lobbied-run-us-senate-against-blumenthal|title=Redding Resident Being Lobbied to Run for U.S. Senate Against Blumenthal|date=December 6, 2015|website=Patch.com|access-date=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jobsforct.com/|title=Jobs for Connecticut|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211081629/https://www.jobsforct.com/|archive-date=December 11, 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref>

In March 2018, Donald Trump appointed Kudlow to be Director of the [[National Economic Council (United States)|National Economic Council]], succeeding [[Gary Cohn]].<ref name=replace/> He assumed office on April 2, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/381317-trump-meets-with-new-top-economic-adviser |title=Trump meets with new top economic adviser |last=Jagoda |first=Naomi |date=April 2, 2018 |work=The Hill |access-date=April 4, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

At the time, Kudlow said that the nonpartisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] was untrustworthy.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/04/17/trumps-top-economic-adviser-never-believe-the-cbo-never-believe-them/|title=Analysis {{!}} Trump's top economic adviser: 'Never believe the CBO … never believe them'|last=Stein|first=Jeff|date=April 17, 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=April 17, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> He dismissed CBO's estimate that the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] would increase the deficit by $1.3 trillion, saying, "Never believe the CBO. Very important: Never believe them. They're always wrong, especially with regard to tax cuts, which they never score properly."<ref name=":2" /> Numerous studies of the tax plan, whether by non-partisan organizations, Wall Street analysts, or right-leaning research organizations, showed that the tax plan would increase the deficit.<ref name=":2" /> In July 2018, Kudlow falsely asserted, "Even the CBO numbers show now that the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better [[Gross domestic product#Nominal GDP and adjustments to GDP|nominal GDP]]." The CBO later found that the tax cut reduced revenues and that the resulting deficits increased by $1.9 trillion after accounting for macroeconomic feedback.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/31/larry-kudlow/wh-economic-chief-kudlow-wrongly-says-cbo-agrees-t/|title=WH's Kudlow wrongly says CBO says tax cuts paid for|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

Also in April, Kudlow alleged that [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]] [[Nikki Haley]] had announced that the U.S. would soon sanction [[Russia]] due to "momentary confusion." After Haley contradicted Kudlow's claim, Kudlow called her to apologize.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/larry-kudlow-apologizes-nikki-haley-over-russia-sanctions-remark-n866916|title=Larry Kudlow apologizes to Nikki Haley over Russia sanctions remark|agency=Associated Press|date=April 18, 2018|work=NBC News|access-date=April 18, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

In April 2018, Kudlow stated, "The trouble I had with the Obama [stimulus] program was it was all spending." However, about 35% of the stimulus was tax relief, including a $116 billion income tax cut.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/04/19/larry-kudlows-claim-that-the-obama-stimulus-was-all-spending/|title=Analysis &#124; Larry Kudlow's claim that the Obama stimulus was 'yall spending'|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/us/politics/19taxes.html |title=From Obama, the Tax Cut Nobody Heard Of |first=Michael |last=Cooper |date=October 18, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

As Trump celebrated the five-month anniversary of the tax cut on June 29, 2018, Kudlow falsely asserted that the tax cut was generating such growth that "the deficit, which was one of the other criticisms, is coming down – and it's coming down rapidly."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/06/29/larry-kudlow-and-the-white-house-now-claim-the-growing-deficit-is-actually-dropping-and-rapidly/|title=Analysis &#124; Trump's top economic adviser makes a laughable claim about a very basic economic number|first1=Aaron|last1=Blake|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/2KmSG1z|title=Kudlow explains himself|first1=Ben|last1=White|first2=Aubree Eliza|last2=Weaver|website=POLITICO}}</ref> [[Kevin Hassett]], chairman of Trump's [[Council of Economic Advisers]], noted days earlier that the deficit was "skyrocketing", which is consistent with the analysis of every reputable budget analyst.<ref name="wpclaim">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/06/29/larry-kudlow-and-the-white-house-now-claim-the-growing-deficit-is-actually-dropping-and-rapidly/|title=Analysis – Trump's top economic adviser makes a laughable claim about a very basic economic number|last=Blake|first=Aaron|date=June 29, 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=kkpF|title=Federal Surplus or Deficit |date=June 12, 2018|access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref> Kudlow later asserted that he was referring to future deficits. Other budget forecasts indicated deficits in coming years would increase as a result of the Trump tax cut unless they were offset by major spending cuts. Barring such reductions, the CBO projected the tax cut would add $1.27 trillion to deficits over the next decade, even after considering any economic growth the tax cut might generate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/29/trumps-top-economic-adviser-says-deficit-is-coming-down-rapidly-contradicting-all-available-data/ |title=Analysis – Trump's top economic adviser says deficit 'is coming down rapidly', contradicting virtually all available data |first=Jeff |last=Stein |date=June 29, 2018 |access-date=July 1, 2018 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

Kudlow asserted on June 29, 2018, that "capital investment, you know, for new jobs and better careers, [is] flowing in from all corners of the world", though [[foreign direct investment]] into America  declined significantly during the two years through August 2019.<ref name="wpclaim"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/economy/foreign-direct-investment-china-us/index.html|title=Foreign investment in America, a driver of jobs, is declining|author=Chris Isidore|website=CNN}}</ref>

On June 29, 2018, Kudlow stated, "This is now, the USA, according to the [[OECD]], the hottest economy in the world."<ref name="wpclaim"/> However, this was not a new phenomenon under the Trump presidency, as by 2015 the American GDP growth rate had been almost twice that of other industrialized countries since 2008, and by 2015 America had created as many jobs as all other industrialized countries combined since 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-strongest-most-durable-ec/|title=Barack Obama says U.S. has 'strongest, most durable economy in the world' during State of the Union|access-date=June 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/17/482328208/u-s-economic-recovery-looks-good-compared-with-sluggish-europe-asia|title=U.S. Economic Recovery Looks Good Compared With Sluggish Europe, Asia|date=June 17, 2016|publisher=NPR|access-date=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Kudlow also asserted: "They've been saying that all along, OK?

In November 2018, eleven months after the Trump tax cut, Kudlow stated, "The tax cut has paid for itself already barely through the first calendar year", although data released later showed that federal revenue had declined and that the deficit had increased during fiscal year 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/11/15/larry_kudlow_tax_cut_has_paid_for_itself_already_through_higher_tax_revenue.html|title=Larry Kudlow: Tax Cut Has Paid For Itself Already Through Higher Tax Revenue And Growth|website=www.realclearpolitics.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/business/trump-tax-cuts-revenue.html |title=It's Official: The Trump Tax Cuts Didn't Pay for Themselves in Year One |first=Jim |last=Tankersley |date=January 11, 2019 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

During the [[Government shutdowns in the United States#December 2018 – January 2019|2018–2019 partial federal government shutdown]], approximately 420,000 federal workers deemed "essential" were compelled to continue working without pay. On the 34th day of the shutdown, Kudlow asserted that such workers were "volunteering" to work for their love of the country and "presumably their allegiance to President Trump."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mediaite.com/uncategorized/larry-kudlow-snaps-at-reporter-federal-workers-are-volunteering-to-work-because-of-their-allegiance-to-trump/ |title=Larry Kudlow Snaps at Reporter: Federal Workers are 'Volunteering' to Work Because of Their 'Allegiance' to Trump |last=Seleh |first=Pardes |publisher=[[Mediaite]] |website=mediaite.com |access-date=June 15, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200116092952/https://www.mediaite.com/uncategorized/larry-kudlow-snaps-at-reporter-federal-workers-are-volunteering-to-work-because-of-their-allegiance-to-trump/ |archive-date=January 16, 2020 }}</ref>

In the summer of 2019, Kudlow twice asserted that the proposed [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement]] would increase GDP by half a percentage point and job creation by 180,000 per year after ratification. The [[International Trade Commission]] analysis that he was apparently referencing estimated that the Agreement would increase GDP by 0.35% and jobs by 176,000 six years following ratification. Another study by the [[Congressional Research Service]] found that the Agreement would not have a measurable effect on jobs, wages, or overall economic growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.factcheck.org/2019/08/kudlows-unsupported-usmca-jobs-claim/ |title=Kudlow's Unsupported USMCA Jobs Claim |first=D'Angelo |last=Gore |date=August 21, 2019 |website=FactCheck.org |publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822205901/https://www.factcheck.org/2019/08/kudlows-unsupported-usmca-jobs-claim/ |archive-date=August 22, 2019 |access-date=June 15, 2020}}</ref>

=== Financial industry ===
In 1987, Kudlow was hired by [[Bear Stearns]] as its chief economist and senior managing director. Kudlow also served as an economic counsel to A. B. Laffer & Associates, the [[San Diego, California]], company owned by [[Arthur Laffer]], a major [[supply-side]] [[economist]] and promoter of the "[[Laffer Curve]]", an economic measure of the relationship between tax levels and government revenue.

He was a member of the [[board of directors]] of [[Empower America]], a [[supply-side economics]] organization founded in 1993 and merged in 2004 with the [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] to form [[FreedomWorks]]. Kudlow is also a founding member of the Board of Advisors for the [[Independent Institute]] and consulting chief economist for American Skandia Life Assurance, Inc., in [[Connecticut]], a subsidiary of [[insurance]] giant [[Prudential Financial]].

=== Media ===
Kudlow became Economics Editor at ''[[National Review Online]]'' (NRO) in May 2001. In December 2007, NRO published a Kudlow article entitled ''Bush Boom Continues'', in which he asserted the economy would continue to expand for years to come.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2007/12/bush-boom-continues-larry-kudlow/|title=Bush Boom Continues |date=December 10, 2007|magazine=National Review|access-date=May 9, 2018}}</ref> The [[Great Recession]], the worst economic downturn since the [[Great Depression]], began that month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles.html|title=US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions|work=National Bureau of Economic Research}}</ref>

Kudlow served as one in a rotating set of hosts on the CNBC show ''[[America Now]]'', which began airing in November 2001. In May 2002, the show was renamed ''[[Kudlow & Cramer]]'', and Kudlow and [[Jim Cramer]] became the permanent hosts. In January 2005, Cramer left to host his own show, ''[[Mad Money]]'', and the program's name was changed the next month to ''[[Kudlow & Company]]''. The program went on hiatus in October 2008, returned in January 2009 as ''[[The Kudlow Report]]'', and ended its run on CNBC in March 2014.

Kudlow is also a regular guest on ''[[Squawk Box]]''. He has contributed to CNBC.com on [[MSN]]. Starting in 2004, he also appeared on ''The [[John Batchelor]] Show'' as a co-host on Tuesdays and as a substitute, until he left to become an economics advisor to President Trump. In March 2006, Kudlow started to host a [[talk radio]] show on politics and economics on [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] as ''The Larry Kudlow Show'' aired on Saturday mornings from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] and via nationwide syndication in the US starting June 5, 2010.

In February 2021, Larry Kudlow joined ''[[Fox Business|Fox Business Network]]'' to host a new weekday program.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Forgey|first=Quint|title=Larry Kudlow to host new program on Fox Business Network|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/26/larry-kudlow-fox-462732|access-date=February 1, 2021|website=POLITICO|language=en}}</ref>

=== Economy ===
A self-described "[[Reaganomics|Reagan]] [[supply side|supply-sider]]", Kudlow is known for his support for tax cuts and deregulation.<ref name=":1">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21738909-larry-kudlow-quintessential-member-republican-partys-business-wing-president|title=President Trump appoints a new economic adviser|newspaper=The Economist|language=en|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref> He argues that reducing tax rates will encourage economic growth and ultimately increase tax revenue and, while acknowledging the limits of growth, that economic growth will clear deficits.<ref name=":0" /> According to ''[[The Economist]]'', Kudlow is "the quintessential member of the Republican Party's business wing".<ref name=":1"/> Kudlow has no formal economics qualifications.<ref name=":1" />

In 1993, Kudlow said that [[Bill Clinton]]'s tax increases would dampen economic growth.<ref name=":1" /> When the economy boomed in the late-1990s, Kudlow credited it to tax cuts enacted during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration (1981–1989)]].<ref name=":1" />

Kudlow was a strong advocate of [[George W. Bush]]'s substantial tax cuts, and argued that the tax cuts would lead to an economic boom of equal magnitude.<ref name=":0" /> After the implementation of the Bush tax cuts, Kudlow said year after year that the economy was in the middle of a "Bush boom", and chastised other commentators for failing to realize it.<ref name=":0" /> Kudlow firmly denied that the United States would enter a [[Great Recession|recession in 2007]], or that it was in the midst of a recession in early to mid-2008. In December 2007, he wrote: "The recession debate is over. It's not gonna happen. Time to move on. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that's a minimum). The Bush boom is alive and well. It's finishing up its sixth splendid year with many more years to come".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlows-money-politics/2452/recession-debate-over-larry-kudlow |title=The Recession Debate Is Over |work=National Review Online |date=December 5, 2007 |access-date=December 15, 2016}}</ref> 

In a May 2008 column entitled "Bush's 'R' is for 'Right{{' "}}, Kudlow wrote: "President George W. Bush may turn out to be the top economic forecaster in the country".<ref>{{cite web |first=Larry |last=Kudlow |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDM0OGU3Nzk0MTMyMGI3NTU1Y2JmYWVhOWU3OTU4ZGQ= |title=Bush's 'R' Is for 'Right' |work=National Review |date=May 2, 2008 |access-date=July 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205061740/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDM0OGU3Nzk0MTMyMGI3NTU1Y2JmYWVhOWU3OTU4ZGQ= |archive-date=February 5, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By July 2008, Kudlow continued to deny that the economy was looking poor, stating that "We are in a mental recession, not an actual recession."<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/blog/kudlows-money-politics/if-things-are-so-bad-larry-kudlow/|title=If Things Are So Bad . . . |date=July 25, 2008|work=National Review|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Lehman Brothers]] collapsed in September 2008, creating a full-blown international [[banking crisis]].<ref name=":0" />

As George W. Bush took office in January 2001, America was in the fourth consecutive fiscal year of federal budget surpluses<ref name="stlouisfed.org">{{cite journal|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=k91g|title=Federal Surplus or Deficit [-]|date=March 27, 2018|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank, St. Louis|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> and the CBO projected increasing surpluses in each year through 2010, totaling over $5 trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/107th-congress-2001-2002/reports/entire-report.pdf |title=The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2002 – 2011 |access-date=March 31, 2020|website=Congressional Budget Office}}</ref> Days before Bush signed his tax cut plan in June, Kudlow predicted it would cause future budget surpluses to rise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2001/05/looking-down-road-larry-kudlow/|title=Looking Up, Down The Road |work=National Review|date=May 29, 2001|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Instead, there were budget deficits in every fiscal year of the Bush administration.<ref name="stlouisfed.org" />

In their 2015 book ''[[Superforecasting]]'', University of Pennsylvania political scientist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and Dan Gardner refer to Kudlow as a "consistently wrong" pundit, and use Kudlow's long record of failed predictions to clarify common mistakes that poor forecasters make.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45OmCQAAQBAJ|title=Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction |last1=Tetlock |first1=Philip |last2=Gardner |first2=Dan |date=September 24, 2015 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-4481-6659-6|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/kudlow-trump-nafta-catastrophe-1.4576572|title=Cancelling NAFTA would be a 'calamitously bad decision', says Trump's new economic adviser|publisher=CBC News|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Kudlow supported free trade prior to his White House appointment. As recently as three weeks before taking office, he co-authored with [[Stephen Moore (writer)|Stephen Moore]] and [[Art Laffer]] an opinion piece entitled ''Tariffs Are Taxes.'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.creators.com/read/lawrence-kudlow/03/18/tariffs-are-taxes|title=Tariffs Are Taxes, by Lawrence Kudlow|date=March 6, 2018|website=www.creators.com}}</ref> in which he argued against the proposed Trump tariffs. However, upon his appointment, he said that he was "in accord" with President Trump's [[Trump tariffs#Steel and aluminum|steel and aluminum tariffs]], apparently as a "negotiating tactic".<ref name=":1" />

Kudlow is not known as a [[deficit hawk]].<ref name=":1" />

=== Politics ===
On June 26, 2002, in a commentary in NRO titled "Taking Back the Market – By Force",<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205232/taking-back-market-force-larry-kudlow|title=Taking Back the Market – By Force|last=Kudlow|first=Larry|date=June 26, 2002|access-date=December 15, 2016|magazine=National Review Online}}</ref> Kudlow called for the United States to attack [[Iraq]], saying [[Saddam Hussein]] had "weapons of mass destruction at his disposal" and that "a lack of decisive follow-through in the global war on terrorism is the single biggest problem facing the stock market and the nation today". In an open letter dated February 12, 2003, he endorsed [[George W. Bush]]'s policies on economic growth and jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030212-2.html|title=Letter to the President on economic growth|date=February 12, 2003|publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref>

In 2016, Kudlow endorsed Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]]. He later defended [[Executive Order 13767]], Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border, declaring it was necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the United States, the United States was at war with [[ISIS]] and Trump was going to do what was necessary to protect the country. He also penned an article for [[RealClearPolitics]] advocating for conservative unity in the election and asking his conservative peers to stop criticizing Trump and instead help him become a stronger candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/04/25/larry_kudlow_a_plea_to_my_conservative_brethren.html |title=A Plea to My Conservative Brethren |publisher=Real Clear Politics |date=March 25, 2016}}</ref>

After the 2018 G7 Summit in Charlevoix, Canada, he criticized Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] in a candid interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Jake Tapper]], saying that Trudeau had "stabbed us in the back".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/10/politics/larry-kudlow-donald-trump-justin-trudeau/index.html|title=Kudlow on Trudeau: 'It was a betrayal'|website=CNN|language=en|access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref>

In the mid-1990s, Kudlow left Bear Stearns and entered a [[12-step program]] in order to deal with his addictions to [[cocaine]] and alcohol. He subsequently converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] under the guidance of [[C. John McCloskey|Father C.
