'''Mirra Komarovsky''' (February 5, 1905 – January 30, 1999), was an American pioneer in the [[sociology of gender]].<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr91/3567/sample_biographies/mirra_komarovsky%20black%20board.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122065718/http://www.columbia.edu/~rr91/3567/sample_biographies/mirra_komarovsky%20black%20board.htm |date=January 22, 2009 }}</ref>

==Early years==
Born to Mendel and Anna Komarovsky  (née Steinberg)<ref name="nyt">[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/01/us/mirra-komarovsky-authority-on-women-s-studies-dies-at-93.html?_r=0 Mirra Komarovsky, Authority on Women's Studies, Dies at 93]. [[New York Times]]</ref> in a privileged [[Jewish]] family in the [[Russian Empire]], her family fled the country after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Komarovsky’s parents were [[Zionists]] and landowning Jews in [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]], Russia, until tsarist police drove them from their home. They moved initially to [[Baku]] (in what is now [[Azerbaijan]]) and then to [[Wichita, Kansas]] after the Bolshevik Revolution, when Mirra was 16. In Baku, Komarovsky lived a solidly middle-class lifestyle; she was [[homeschool]]ed by private tutors and learned Russian, English, Hebrew, and French, as well as playing the piano.

==Life in the United States==
Once in the United States, she graduated from Wichita High School within a year and in 1922,<ref name="britannica">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirra-Komarovsky Mirra Komarovsky]. Britannica.com</ref> she was admitted to [[Barnard College]] as part of the class of 1926. One of her professors, sociologist [[William Ogburn]], advised her not to pursue higher education, largely because of the prescribed [[gender role]]s and anti-semitism<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11421.html KOMAROVSKY, MIRRA]. [[Jewish Virtual Library]]</ref> at the time. Nonetheless, she earned her master's degree from [[Columbia University]] and proceeded to earn her Ph.D.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name="wordpress1">{{cite web|url=http://barnardarchives.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/mirra-komarovsky-papers-available/ |title=Mirra Komarovsky papers available |publisher=Barnard College Archives |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref>

==Komarovsky as a sociologist==
Komarovsky's dissertation topic, which she stumbled upon in 1935 through a research position with mathematician [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] at the New York [[Institute for Social Research]], was “The Unemployed Man and His Family." She earned her Ph.D. in [[Sociology]] in 1940 from [[Columbia University]] because of this work. Later published as a book, ''The Unemployed Man'' was an intensive study of fifty-nine families in the qualitative sociological method.

Komarovsky built her legacy on researching the social and cultural attitudes of families. Much of her work focused on the idea of “[[cultural lag]],” in which the cultural attitudes surrounding women generally lag behind technological and social advances. Throughout the rest of her career, she continued to study the role of women and the outlooks of society towards those roles. She became one of the first social scientists to look critically at gender and the role of women in society.<ref name="wordpress1"/>

Professor Komarovsky retired in 1970 after 32 years on the faculty of [[Barnard College]]. But she returned to Barnard in 1978 and became the chairwoman of its [[women's studies]] program until 1992<ref name="britannica"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Pace, Eric |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/01/us/mirra-komarovsky-authority-on-women-s-studies-dies-at-93.html?pagewanted=all |title=Mirra Komarovsky, Authority on Women's Studies, Dies at 93 |work=The New York Times |date=1999-02-01 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref>

In 1973 and 1974, she became the second woman after [[Dorothy Swaine Thomas]]<ref name="britannica"/> to be president of the [[American Sociological Association]]. Her research during the 1980s tracked many of the changes taking place in the consciousness of young women and their life choices in response to the feminist movement.<ref>[http://125.barnard.edu/notable-people/mirra-komarovsky Mirra Komarovsky] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815053453/http://125.barnard.edu/notable-people/mirra-komarovsky |date=2016-08-15 }}. [[Barnard College]]</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1940, she married Marcus A. Heyman.<ref name="nyt"/> She died at New York City on January 30, 1999.<ref>[http://www.asanet.org/about-asa/asa-story/asa-history/past-asa-officers/past-asa-presidents/mirra-komarovsky Mirra Komarovsky]. [[American Sociological Association]]</ref>
