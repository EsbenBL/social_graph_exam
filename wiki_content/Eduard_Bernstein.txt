'''Eduard Bernstein''' ({{IPA-de|ˈeːduaʁt ˈbɛʁnʃtaɪn|lang}}; 6 January 1850 – 18 December 1932) was a German [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[Marxist theorist]] and [[politician]]. A member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), Bernstein had held close association to [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], but he began to identify what he believed to be errors in Marxist thinking and began to criticize views held by [[Marxism]] when he investigated and challenged the Marxist [[historical materialism|materialist theory of history]].<ref>[[Sheri Berman|Berman, Sheri]]. ''Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. pp. 38–39.</ref> He rejected significant parts of Marxist theory that were based upon [[Hegelian metaphysics]] and rejected the [[Hegelian]] perspective of an immanent economic necessity to socialism.<ref>Michael Harrington. ''Socialism: Past and Future''. Reprint edition of original published in 1989. New York, New York, USA: Arcade Publishing, 2011. P. 251.</ref>

== Early life ==
Bernstein was born in [[Schöneberg]] (now part of [[Berlin]]) to Jewish parents who were active in the Reform Temple on the Johannistrasse whose services were performed on Sunday. His father was a locomotive driver. From 1866 to 1878, he was employed in banks as a banker's clerk after leaving school.<ref name="eb">{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Bernstein, Eduard}}</ref>

Bernstein's political career began in 1872, when he joined a [[socialist]] party with [[Marxist]] tendencies, known formally as the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]]. The party was a proponent of the [[Eisenach]] style of German socialism, named after the German town where it was founded. Bernstein soon became known as an activist. His party contested two elections against a rival socialist party, the Lassalleans ([[Ferdinand Lassalle]]'s [[General German Workers' Association]]), but in both elections neither party was able to win a significant majority of the [[left-wing]] vote. Consequently, Bernstein, together with [[August Bebel]] and [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], prepared the ''Einigungsparteitag'' ("Unification Party Congress") with the Lassalleans in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] in 1875. [[Karl Marx]]'s famous ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'' criticised what he saw as a Lassallean victory over the Eisenachers, whom he favoured. Bernstein later noted that it was Liebknecht, considered by many to be the strongest Marxist advocate within the Eisenacher faction, who proposed the inclusion of many of the ideas that so thoroughly irritated Marx.

In the [[1877 German federal election|1877 elections]], the [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) gained 493,000 votes. However, two assassination attempts on [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]] the next year provided Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] a pretext to introduce a law banning all socialist organisations, assemblies and publications. There had been no Social Democratic involvement in either assassination attempt, but the popular reaction against "enemies of the Reich" induced a compliant [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] to approve Bismarck's [[Anti-Socialist Laws]].<ref name="TPOS">''The Preconditions of Socialism'' Eduard Bernstein</ref>

Bismarck's strict anti-socialist legislation was passed on 12 October 1878. For nearly all practical purposes the SPD was outlawed, and it was actively suppressed throughout Germany. However, it was still possible for Social Democrats to campaign as individuals for election to the Reichstag, which they did in spite of severe persecution. The party actually increased its electoral success, gaining 550,000 votes in 1884 and 763,000 in 1887.

==Exile==
The vehemence of Bernstein's opposition to the government of Bismarck made it desirable for him to leave Germany.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Bernstein, Eduard}}</ref> Shortly before the Anti-Socialist Laws came into effect, Bernstein went into [[exile]] in [[Zurich]], accepting a position as the private secretary of [[Karl Höchberg]], a wealthy supporter of social democracy. A warrant subsequently issued for his arrest ruled out any possibility for him to return to Germany, and he was to remain in exile for more than 20 years. In 1888, Bismarck convinced the Swiss government to expel a number of important members of German social democracy and so Bernstein relocated to [[London]], where he associated with [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Kautsky]]. It was soon after his arrival in Switzerland that he began to think of himself as a Marxist.<ref>Berstein, Sozialdemokratische Lehrjahre, p.72; Berstein to Bebel, 20.10.1898, Tudor and Tudor, p.324.</ref> In 1880, he accompanied Bebel to London to clear up a misunderstanding concerning his involvement with an article published by Höchberg that was denounced by Marx and Engels as being "chock-full of bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideas". The visit was a success, and Engels in particular was impressed by Bernstein's zeal and ideas.

Back in Zurich, Bernstein became increasingly active in working for ''Der Sozialdemokrat'' (''Social Democrat'') and later succeeded [[Georg von Vollmar]] as the paper's editor, which he was for 10 years. It was during those years between 1880 and 1890 that Bernstein established his reputation as a major party theoretician and a Marxist of impeccable orthodoxy. He was helped in that by the close personal and professional relationship he established with Engels. The relationship owed much to the fact that he shared Engels's strategic vision and accepted most of the particular policies that Engels believed the ideas to entail. In 1887, the German government persuaded the Swiss authorities to ban ''Der Sozialdemokrat''. Bernstein moved to London, where he resumed publication from premises in [[Kentish Town]]. His relationship with Engels soon developed into friendship. He also communicated with various English socialist organizations, notably the [[Fabian Society]] and [[Henry Mayers Hyndman]]'s [[Social Democratic Federation]].<ref>This influence is particularly evident in Bernstein's ''My Years of Exile: Reminiscences of a Socialist'' (London, 1921).</ref> In later years, his opponents routinely claimed that his "[[revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]]" was caused by seeing the world "through English spectacles". However, Bernstein denied the charges.<ref>Bernstein to Bebel, 20.10.1898, Tudor and Tudor, pp. 325-6.</ref>

In 1895, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'', written by Marx in 1850, had been edited by Bernstein and Kautsky in a manner that left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorwärts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been ''printed without my knowledge'' and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality ''quand même'' (at all costs). Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what's more, without so much as a word to me about it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Collected Works, Volume 50|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|publisher=International Publishers|year=2004|location=New York|page=86}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1891, Bernstein was one of the authors of the [[Erfurt Program]] and from 1896 to 1898, he published a series of articles entitled ''Probleme des Sozialismus'' (''Problems of Socialism'') that resulted in the revisionism debate in the SPD.<ref>Wolfgang Eichhorn: Über Eduard Bernstein. Gegensatz und Berührungspunkte zu Rosa Luxemburg und W. I. Lenin, in: [[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. I/2002.</ref> He also published the book ''Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie'' (''The Prerequisites for Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy'') in 1899. The book was in great contrast to the positions of Bebel, Kautsky and Liebknecht. [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s 1900 essay ''[[Reform or Revolution?]]'' was also a polemic against Bernstein's position. In 1900, Berstein published ''Zur Geschichte und Theorie des Sozialismus'' (''The History and Theory of Socialism'').<ref name=nie/>

==Return to Germany==
[[File:USPD-Vorstand.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[USPD]] board on 5 December 1919 included Bernstein.]]
In 1901, Bernstein returned to Germany after the end of the ban that had kept him from entering the country. He became an editor of the newspaper ''[[Vorwärts]]'' that year<ref name=ea/><ref name=nie/> and a member of the Reichstag from 1902 to 1918. He voted against the armament tabling in 1913, together with the SPD fraction's left wing. Although he voted for war credits in August 1914, he opposed [[World War I]] from July 1915 and, in 1917, was among the founders of the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), which united antiwar socialists, including [[reformists]] like Bernstein, [[Centrist Marxism|centrists]] like Kautsky and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]] like [[Karl Liebknecht]]. He was a member of the USPD until 1919, when he rejoined the SPD. From 1920 to 1928, Bernstein was again a member of the Reichstag. He retired from political life in 1928.

==Death and legacy==
Bernstein died on 18 December 1932 in Berlin. A commemorative plaque is placed in his memory at Bozener Straße 18, Berlin-Schöneberg, where he lived from 1918 until his death. His grave in the Eisackstrasse Cemetery became a ''grave of honour'' ({{lang-de|[[Ehrengrab]]}}) in Berlin.

== Opinions ==
=== Opposition to violent revolution ===
''Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus'' (1899) was Bernstein's most significant work. Bernstein was principally concerned with refuting [[Karl Marx]]'s predictions about the imminent and inevitable demise of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and Marx's consequent [[laissez-faire]] policy which opposed ameliorative social interventions before the demise. Bernstein indicated simple facts, which he considered to be evidence that Marx's predictions were not being borne out while he noted that while the centralisation of capitalist industry was significant, it was not becoming wholescale and that the ownership of capital was becoming more and not less diffuse.<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Bernstein, Eduard |year=1905}}</ref><ref name=dvds>''Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus'' (1899)</ref> Bernstein's analysis of agriculture, according to which Bernstein believed that land ownership was becoming less concentrated, was largely based on the work of [[Eduard David]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Comrades!|last=Service|first=Robert|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=49}}</ref> and was in its marshalling of facts impressive enough that even his [[Orthodox Marxist]] opponent [[Karl Kautsky]] acknowledged its value.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kolakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2008|pages=433–435}}</ref>

As to Marx's belief in the disappearance of the middleman, Bernstein declared that the [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] class was being steadily recruited from the [[proletariat]] class and so all compromise measures, such as the state regulation of the hours of labour and provisions for old-age pensions should be encouraged. For that reason, Bernstein urged the [[working class|labouring classes]] to take an active interest in politics.<ref name=nie/> Bernstein also indicated what he considered to be some of the flaws in Marx's [[labour theory of value]].<ref name=dvds/>

Looking especially at the rapid growth in Germany, Bernstein argued that middle-sized firms would flourish, the size and power of the middle class would grow and that capitalism would successfully adjust and not collapse. He warned that a violent [[proletarian revolution]], as in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in 1848]], produced only reactionary successes, which undermined workers' interests. Therefore, he rejected revolution and instead insisted the best strategy to be patiently building up a durable social movement working for continuous nonviolent incremental change.<ref>Richard A. Fletcher, "Cobden as Educator: The Free-Trade Internationalism of Eduard Bernstein, 1899-1914." ''American Historical Review'' 88.3 (1983): 563-68.</ref>

In his work, ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein and Social Democracy'', [[Manfred Steger]] touches on Bernstein's desire for socialism through peaceful means and incremental legislation. Some say that is Marxism in its mature form after the revisionists claimed many of Marx's theories to be wrong and came up with theories of their own, including socialism coming through democratic means.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steger |first1=Manfred |title=The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism |date=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |pages=236–237}}</ref>

===Bernstein's moderation under attack===
Bernstein was vilified by the [[orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxists]] led by [[Karl Kautsky]] as well as the more radical current led by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] for his [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]].<ref>Peter Gay, ''The Dilemma of Democratic Socialism: Eduard Bernstein's challenge to Marx'' (1952) p 258ff</ref> Nonetheless, Bernstein remained very much a socialist, albeit an unorthodox one as he believed that socialism would be achieved by the advancement of capitalism to social democracy and so on, not by capitalism's destruction (as rights were gradually won by workers, their cause for grievance would be diminished and consequently, so too would the motivation for revolution). During the intra-party debates about his ideas, Bernstein explained that for him the final goal of socialism was nothing; progress toward that goal was everything.

Luxemburg argued that [[socialism]] has its end in [[social revolution]] and revisionism "amounts in practice to the advice [...] that we abandon the social revolution—the goal of Social Democracy—and turn social reform from a means of the class struggle into its final aim".<ref>Gay, ''The Dilemma of Democratic Socialism: Eduard Bernstein's challenge to Marx'' (1952) p 259</ref> She says revisionism has lost sight of [[scientific socialism]] and reverted to [[German idealism|idealism]] and therefore lost its predictive force. Since reformists underestimate the anarchy of capitalism{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} and say it has adaptability and viability, by which they mean that the contradictions of capitalism would not of historical necessity drive it to its doom, Luxemburg said they would abandon the objective necessity for socialism and give up all hope for a socialist future. The movement would collapse unless revisionism is repudiated. Trade unionists, who could see the successes of capitalism and the improvement of working conditions and who wanted to improve working conditions through parliament, generally followed Bernstein while those who were more orthodox hardliners generally followed Luxemburg.<ref>Gay, ''The Dilemma of Democratic Socialism: Eduard Bernstein's challenge to Marx'' (1952) p 260</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
Foreign policy was Bernstein's main intellectual interest between 1902 and 1914, with many articles in the ''[[Sozialistische Monatshefte]]'' (''Socialist Monthly''). He advocated policy positions for Germany that were aggressively nationalist, imperialist and expansionist.<ref>Roger Fletcher, "In the interest of peace and progress: Eduard Bernstein's socialist foreign policy." ''Review of International Studies'' 9.2 (1983): 79-93.</ref><ref>Roger Fletcher, "Revisionism and Wilhelmine Imperialism" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1988) 23#3 pp 347-366. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/260687 online]</ref>

Bernstein considered [[protectionism]] (high tariffs on imports) as helping only a selective few, being ''fortschrittsfeindlich'' (anti-progressive) for its negative effects on the masses. He argued Germany's protectionism was based only on political expediency, isolating Germany from the world (especially from Britain), creating an [[autarky]] that would result only in conflict between Germany and the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. A. |last=Fletcher |title=Cobden as Educator: The Free-Trade Internationalism of Eduard Bernstein, 1899–1914 |year=1983 |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=561–578 |doi=10.2307/1864587 |jstor=1864587}}</ref> Bernstein wanted to end Germany's protectionism and argued that tariffs did not increase grain production, did not counter British competition, did not increase farm profits and did not promote improvements in farming. Instead, it inflated rents, interest rates and prices, hurting everyone involved. In contrast, he argued that [[free trade]] led to peace, democracy, prosperity and the highest material and moral well-being of all humanity.<ref>Fletcher, "Cobden as Educator" 563-69.</ref>

Bernstein rejected reactionary bourgeois nationalism and called instead for a cosmopolitan-libertarian nationalism. He recognized the historical role of the national factor and said that the proletariat must support their country against external dangers. He called on workers to assimilate themselves within nation-states, which entailed support for colonial policies and imperial projects. Bernstein was sympathetic to the idea of imperial expansions as a positive and civilizing mission, which resulted in a bitter series of polemics with the anti-imperialist [[Ernest Belfort Bax]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/bax/1896/bernstein/bernstein1.htm|title=E. Belfort Bax: Our German Fabian Convert (1896)|last=Bax|first=Ernest Belfort|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref> Bernstein supported colonialism as he believed it uplifted backward peoples and it worked well for both Britain and Germany. Bernstein supported such policies in an intensely racialised manner, arguing in 1896 that "races who are hostile to or incapable of civilisation cannot claim our sympathy when they revolt against civilisation" and that the "savages [must] be subjugated and made to conform to the rules of higher civilisation".<ref>Mcgeever, Brendan, and Satnam Virdee. "Antisemitism and Socialist Strategy in Europe, 1880–1917: An Introduction." Patterns of Prejudice 51.3-4 (2017): 229</ref> However, he was disturbed by the Kaiser's reckless policies. He wanted strong friendship especially with Britain and France and protection against the Russian threat to Germany. He envisioned a sort of league of nations.<ref>Roger Fletcher, "Revisionism ad Wilhelmine Imperialism" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (11988) 23#3 pp 347-366.</ref><ref>Roger Fletcher, "An English Advocate in Germany. Eduard Bernstein’s Analysis of Anglo-German Relations 1900-1914." Canadian Journal of History 13.2 (1978) pp: 209-236.</ref>

=== Zionism ===
Bernstein's views on Jewish matters evolved. He never identified as a [[Zionist]], but after initially favouring a wholly assimilationist solution to "the [[Jewish Question]]", his attitude toward Zionism became considerably more sympathetic after World War I.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=On Socialists and the Jewish Question After Marx|author=Jacobs, J.|date=1992|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=9780814742136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XffJLtagfF4C|page=193|access-date=2014-12-12}}</ref><ref name="google2">{{cite book|title=A History of Zionism: From the French Revolution to the Establishment of the State of Israel|author=Laqueur, W.|date=2009|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307530851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEt5PWCTMJMC|page=425|access-date=2014-12-12}}</ref>

Bernstein is also noted for being "one of the first socialists to deal sympathetically with the issue of [[homosexuality]]".<ref name="marxists">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bernstein/index.htm |title=The Eduard Bernstein Internet Archive <!--|########## Eduard Bernstein Archive #########--> |publisher=marxists.org|access-date=2014-12-12}}</ref>
