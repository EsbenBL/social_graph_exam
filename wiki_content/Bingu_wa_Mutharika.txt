'''Bingu wa Mutharika''' ({{IPAc-en|m|u|ˈ|t|æ|r|ɪ|k|ə}}; born '''Brightson Webster Ryson Thom'''; 24 February 1934&nbsp;– 5 April 2012) was a Malawian politician and economist who was [[President of Malawi]] from May 2004 until his death in April 2012. He was also President of the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Malawi)|Democratic Progressive Party]], which he founded in February 2005; it obtained a majority in Malawi's parliament in the [[2009 Malawian general election|2009 general election]].

During his two terms in office, he was noted for being the [[Chairperson of the African Union]] in 2010&ndash;2011, as well as for several domestic controversies. In 2009, he purchased a private presidential jet for $13.26&nbsp;million. This was followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage, which was officially blamed on logistical problems but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the freezing of aid by the international community.<ref>{{cite news|title=Britain reduces aid to Malawi over presidential jet|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/malawiNews/idAFLDE62921I20100310?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021817/http://af.reuters.com/article/malawiNews/idAFLDE62921I20100310?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 May 2011|work=Reuters|date=10 March 2010}}</ref> He died in office from a cardiac arrest on 5 April 2012, at age 78.

==Early life and career==
Bingu wa Mutharika was born Brightson Webster Ryson Thom on 24 February 1934 in the village of Kamoto in [[Thyolo District]], and is a member of the [[Lomwe people|Lomwe ethnic group]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/bingu-wa-mutharika-president-of-malawi-dies-at-78/2012/04/06/gIQARMMk0S_story_1.html | work=The Washington Post | first=T.

His father was a teacher for 37 years and his mother taught the women of the [[Mvanip|Mvano]] group.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Upon completing his primary education at Ulongwe Mission and Chingoli, Mulanje, Ntambanyama, Malamulo, in Thyolo and Henri Henderson Institute in [[Blantyre]], Mutharika obtained a Grade A [[Cambridge]] Overseas School Leaving Certificate at Dedza Secondary School in 1956. After that, he joined the Nyasaland civil service. In 1964, he was one of the 32 Malawians selected by [[Hastings Kamuzu Banda]] (President of [[Malawi]] 1961–1994) to travel to [[India]] on an [[Indira Gandhi]] scholarship for 'fast track' diplomas. The BBC reports that he went to India to "escape then President Hastings Banda's crackdown on political opponents". At some point during the 1960s, he also changed his name, to Bingu wa Mutharika.<ref name="BBC" />{{Failed verification|date=August 2021}} In India, Mutharika earned his bachelor's degree in Economics from the [[Shri Ram College of Commerce]], Delhi.

==Presidential campaigns (1999–2009)==
Mutharika co-founded the [[United Democratic Front (Malawi)|United Democratic Front]] in 1992. He stood as a presidential candidate for the United Party (a party he had formed) in the [[1999 Malawian general election|1999 presidential election]], finishing last.<ref name="BBC" />

===Nomination===
Mutharika was nominated by President Muluzi as his successor. Mutharika won the [[2004 Malawian general election|presidential election]] on 20 May 2004, ahead of [[John Tembo]] and [[Gwanda Chakuamba]], and took office a few days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecosocc-au.org/index.php?page=au |title=Ecosocc |publisher=Ecosocc-au.org |access-date=13 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721201814/http://www.ecosocc-au.org/index.php?page=au |archive-date=21 July 2013  }}</ref>

===First term===
During President Mutharika's first term in office (2004–2008), the country achieved a high rate of agricultural production and [[food security]]. The President's initiatives, centred on a programme of [[agricultural subsidy]], benefited approximately 1,700,000 resource poor [[smallholding|smallholder]] farmers. In the 2005/2006 crop season, Malawi achieved a food surplus of more than 500,000 metric tons. During the 2008/2009 planting season, food surpluses topped 1.3&nbsp;million metric tons. This agricultural policy was widely regarded as successful but expensive, and was curtailed in 2011.<ref name=iri>{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/printreport.aspx?reportid=93954 |title=IRIN Africa &#124; MALAWI: Farm subsidy programme shrinks &#124; Governance |agency=IRIN |date=13 October 2011 |access-date=13 January 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, Malawi's Ministry of Finance estimated that during the previous four years the share of Malawians living below the poverty line fell from 52 percent to 40 percent. This has been attributed to the country's agricultural policies, which have been seen as pioneering in the context of African economic development.<ref name=un.afrec.25.1>{{cite web |last=Harsch |first=Ernest |url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol25no1/investing-african-agriculture.html |title=Africa Renewal Magazine &#124; Investing in Africa's farms – and its future |publisher=United Nations |date=23 November 2010 |access-date=13 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230184142/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol25no1/investing-african-agriculture.html |archive-date=30 December 2011  }}</ref>

In addition to championing food security in Malawi, Mutharika promoted a similar approach for Africa. While Chairman of the African Union in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.int/ |title=African Union |publisher=Au.int |access-date=13 January 2012}}</ref> the President laid down a plan for Africa to achieve sustainability and food security.<ref>{{cite news|last=McLure |first=Jason |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aP49H8lYYb.E |title=Malawi's Mutharika Named Next African Union Chairman (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=31 January 2010 |access-date=13 January 2012}}</ref> He proposed a new partnership with other African nations, which he called the "African Food Basket",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nepad.org/foodsecurity/news/1786/%E2%80%9Cit-possible-africa-become-food-basket-world%E2%80%9D-mutharika |title="It is possible for Africa to become the food basket of the world," says Mutharika |publisher=NEPAD |date=28 October 2010 |access-date=13 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211165330/http://nepad.org/foodsecurity/news/1786/%E2%80%9Cit-possible-africa-become-food-basket-world%E2%80%9D-mutharika |archive-date=11 December 2011  }}</ref> outlining a strategy incorporating subsidies to small farmers, especially women, improvements in irrigation, and improving agriculture and food security over 5 years through innovative interventions that comprise subsidies, increased budgetary allocations, private sector investment and affordable information and communications technology. Approximately half of the country's subsistence farmers received vouchers which provided discounts on maize seed and fertiliser. To sustain the program, the Malawi Government allocated 11 percent of its budget for 2010/2011 to agriculture, continuing a rare record of commitment on this scale in Africa. The level of investment in the programme was reduced in 2011.<ref name=iri/>

Mutharika was accused of trying to sideline and isolate his vice-president, [[Joyce Banda]]. He expelled her from the party in 2010 because she refused to accept the nomination of [[Peter Mutharika]] as the next president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-04-06-joyce-banda-poised-to-lead-malawi-after-mutharika-dies-in-office |title=Banda poised to lead Malawi after Mutharika dies in office – News – Mail & Guardian Online |work=Mail & Guardian |date=12 April 1950 |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref> She remained vice-president of the country because there had been no formal impeachment process.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

As a result of the [[Cochrane-Dyet 2011 cable controversy]] that accused Mutharika of being increasingly 'arrogant' and 'autocratic', he expelled the [[British High Commissioner]].<ref name="Yahoo">{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/malawi-president-dies-heart-attack-hospital-075230249.html |title=Malawi president dies, leaving nation in suspense |agency=Agence France-Presse |first=Felix |last=Mponda |publisher=Yahoo!

In 2011, days of [[2011 Malawi protests|nationwide protests]] occurred, sparked by worsening fuel shortages, rising prices and high unemployment.
