==Academic career==
Johnson graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Baylor University]] and the [[University of Chicago]], and an [[Master of Arts]] from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (PhD, 1927). After teaching a year each at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] and Baylor College for Women (now Mary-Hardin Baylor), Johnson was recruited to North Carolina as a research assistant in Howard W.

He taught at Chapel Hill from 1927 until he retired as Kenan Professor of [[Sociology]] and [[Anthropology]] in 1969.

His main writings were on Southern black folk culture and U.S. race relations.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/36 36/7]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/36}}</ref>  In ''Folk Culture'', he analyzed the Gullah dialect of English spoken by blacks on that isolated South Carolina island and, in sophisticated technical detail, the musical structure of the spirituals they sang to support a new interpretation of black folk culture.
