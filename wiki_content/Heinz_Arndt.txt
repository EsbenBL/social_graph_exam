==Biography==
Heinz Wolfgang Arndt was born in [[Breslau]], [[Germany]], in 1915, the eldest son of [[Fritz Arndt|Fritz Georg Arndt]] (1885-1969) and Julia (née Heimann). Arndt gained two degrees at [[Oxford]] and taught at the [[London School of Economics]] and [[University of Manchester]] before settling in Australia in 1946. While studying in England, he married his wife Ruth (nee Strohsahl) with whom he later lived in Canberra until her death in 2001.  In 1950, Arndt took up a chairmanship in economics at the then [[Canberra University College]]. He became head of the department at the [[Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies]] (RSPAS) at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) in 1963.  He held this position until retiring in 1980. One of his main activities as head of the department was his establishment and management of the [[Indonesia Project]] which sponsors research on the [[Indonesian economy]].<ref>Arndt's work with the Indonesia Project is discussed in detail in Colin Brown, ''Australia's Indonesia Project: 50 Years of Engagement''. 2015.
