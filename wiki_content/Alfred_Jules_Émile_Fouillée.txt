'''Alfred Jules Émile Fouillée''' (18 October 1838{{snd}}16 January 1912) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Fouillée was born at [[La Pouëze]], [[Maine-et-Loire]]. He held several minor philosophical lectureships, and from 1864 was professor of philosophy at the lycées of [[Douai]], [[Montpellier]] and [[Bordeaux]] successively. In 1867 and 1868 he was crowned by the Academy of Moral Science for his work on [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]]. In 1872 he was elected master of conferences at the Ecole Normale, and was made doctor of philosophy in recognition of his two treatises, ''Platonis Hippias Minor sine Socratica contra liberum arbitrium argumenta'' and ''La Liberté et le déterminisme''.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Fouillée, Alfred Jules Emile|volume=10|page=737}}</ref>

The strain of the next three years' continuous work undermined his health and his eyesight, and he was compelled to retire from his professorship. During these years he had published works on Plato and Socrates and a history of philosophy (1875); but after his retirement he further developed his philosophical position, a speculative eclecticism through which he endeavoured to reconcile [[metaphysical idealism]] with the naturalistic and mechanical standpoint of science.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In ''L'Evolutionnisme des idées-forces'' (1890), ''La Psychologie des idées-forces'' (1893), and ''La Morale des idées-forces'' (1907), is elaborated his doctrine of idées forces, or of mind as efficient cause through the tendency of ideas to realize themselves in appropriate movement. Ethical and sociological developments of this theory succeed its physical and psychological treatment, the consideration of the [[antinomy]] of freedom being especially important.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Fouillée's wife, [[Augustine Tuillerie|Augustine Fouillée]], who by a previous marriage was the mother of the poet and philosopher [[Jean-Marie Guyau]], is better known, under the pseudonym of "G Bruno," as the author of the books for children,<ref name="EB1911"/> including educational novel and school book ''[[Le Tour de la France par deux enfants]]'' (1877).

Fouillée occupied the [[Les Colombières]] estate in [[Menton]], which was later remodelled by [[Ferdinand Bac]].<ref name="RT">{{cite news|title=An Eden resurrected |work=Riviera Times |date=14 June 2011 |url=http://www.rivieratimes.com/index.php/lifestyle-article/items/an-eden-resurrected-6500-1406.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022818/http://www.rivieratimes.com/index.php/lifestyle-article/items/an-eden-resurrected-6500-1406.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}</ref> He died on 16 January 1912 in [[Lyon]].<ref>{{BNF|12031236v}}</ref>
