==Movement for Sanitation and Hygiene==
He first came to understand the plight of scavengers in 1968 when he joined the Bhangi-Mukti (scavengers’ liberation) Cell of the Bihar Gandhi Centenary Celebrations Committee. During that time, he travelled throughout India, living with scavenger families as part of his Ph.D. research. Drawing on that experience, he resolved to take action, not only out of sympathy for the scavengers but also in the belief that scavenging is a dehumanising practice that would ultimately have a destructive impact on modern Indian society. He was an MP of Bhagalpur in Indian National Congress. 

He established the Sulabh International Social Service Organization in 1970, combining technical innovation with humanitarian principles.<ref>[http://www.siwi.org/sa/node.asp?node=432  Indian Sanitation Innovator and Social Reformer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704235218/http://www.siwi.org/sa/node.asp?node=432 |date=4 July 2010 }}.

The organisation counts 50,000 volunteers. He has made innovative use of [[biogas]] creation by linking Sulabh toilets to fermentation plants, he had designed over three decades ago and which are now becoming a byword for sanitation in developing countries all over the world. One of the distinctive feature of Pathak's project lies in the fact that besides producing odour-free bio-gas, it also releases clean water rich in phosphorus and other ingredients which are important constituents of organic manure. His sanitation movement ensures cleanliness and prevents [[greenhouse gas emissions|greenhouse gas emission]].
