{{Politics sidebar|Disciplines}}
'''Comparative politics''' is a field in [[political science]] characterized either by the use of the ''[[Mill's Methods|comparative method]]'' or other empirical methods to explore politics both within and between countries. Substantively, this can include questions relating to [[Institution|political institutions]], [[political behavior]], conflict, and the causes and consequences of [[economic development]]. When applied to specific fields of study, comparative politics may be referred to by other names, such as '''comparative government''' (the comparative study of forms of [[government]]).

==Definitions==

Comparative politics is the systematic study and comparison of the diverse political systems in the world. It is comparative in searching to explain why different political systems have similarities or differences and how developmental changes came to be between them. It is systematic in that it looks for trends, patterns, and regularities among these political systems.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book|last=Wiarda|first=Howard|editor1-first=Howard J|editor1-last=Wiarda|date=June 17, 2019|title=New Directions in Comparative Politics|doi=10.4324/9780429494932|isbn=978-0-429-49493-2}}</ref> The research field takes into account political systems throughout the globe, focusing on themes such as [[democratization]], [[globalization]], and integration.<ref name="auto"/> New theories and approaches have been used in political science in the last 40 years thanks to comparative politics. Some of these focus on [[political culture]], [[dependency theory]], developmentalism, [[corporatism]], indigenous theories of change, comparative political economy, state-society relations, and new institutionalism.<ref name="auto"/> Some examples of comparative politics are studying the differences between presidential and [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], [[democracies]] and [[Dictatorship|dictatorships]], parliamentary systems in different countries, multi-party systems such as [[Canada]] and two-party systems such as the [[United States]]. Comparative politics must be conducted at a specific point in time, usually the present. A researcher cannot compare systems from different periods of time; it must be static.<ref name="auto"/>

While historically the discipline explored broad questions in political science through between-country comparisons, contemporary comparative political science primarily uses subnational comparisons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=William|last2 = Golder| first2 = Matt|last3 = Golder|first3 = Sona|date=2019|title=Foundations of Comparative Politics|location=Thousand Oaks,CA|publisher= CQ Press|page= 6|isbn=978-1-5063-6073-7}}</ref> More recently, there has been a significant increase in the interest of subnational comparisons and the benefit it has on comparative politics. We would know far less about major credible issues within political science if it weren't for subnational research. Subnational research contributes important methodological, theoretical, and substantive ideas to the study of politics.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite book|last=Giraudy|first=Agustina|editor1-first=Agustina|editor1-last=Giraudy|editor2-first=Eduardo|editor2-last=Moncada|editor3-first=Richard|editor3-last=Snyder|date=2019|title=Subnational Research in Comparative Politics|doi=10.1017/9781108678384|isbn=978-1-108-67838-4}}</ref> Important developments often obscured by a national-level focus are easier to decipher through subnational research. An example could be regions inside countries where the presence of state institutions have been reduced in effect or value.<ref name="auto1"/>

The name '''comparative politics''' refers to the discipline's historical association with the [[Mill's Methods|comparative method]], described in detail [[Comparative Politics#(Mill's) Comparative Method|below]]. [[Arend Lijphart]] argues that comparative politics does not have a ''substantive'' focus in itself, but rather a ''methodological'' one: it focuses on "the ''how'' but does not specify the ''what'' of the analysis."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lijphart|first=Arend|s2cid=55713809|year=1971|title=Comparative politics and the comparative method|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=65|issue=3|pages=682–693|jstor=1955513|doi=10.2307/1955513}}</ref> [[Peter Mair]] and [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] advance a slightly different definition, arguing that comparative politics is defined by a combination of a ''substantive'' focus on the study of countries' political systems and a ''method'' of identifying and explaining similarities and differences between these countries using common concepts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mair|first=Peter|title=A New Handbook of Political Science|editor=Goodin, Robert E.|editor2=Klingemann, Hans-Dieter|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1996|pages=309–335|chapter=Comparative politics: An introduction to comparative.overview|isbn=0-19-829471-9|chapter-url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/414665/1998/00000001/00000001/art00016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606215002/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/414665/1998/00000001/00000001/art00016|archive-date=2011-06-06|access-date=2008-08-25}}</ref><ref name="Rose">{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Richard|year=1991|title=Comparing forms of comparative analysis|journal=Political Studies|volume=39|issue=3|pages=446–462|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119347508/abstract|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121021212603/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119347508/abstract|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-10-21|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1991.tb01622.x|last2=MacKenzie|first2=W.

Sometimes, especially in the United States, the term "comparative politics" is used to refer to "the politics of foreign countries." This usage of the term is disputed.<ref>Hopkin, J. [2002 (1995)] "Comparative Methods", in Marsh, D. and G. Stoker (ed.) ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 249–250</ref><ref name="vanBiezen">{{cite journal|last=van Biezen|first=Ingrid|author-link=Ingrid van Biezen|author2=Caramani, Daniele|year=2006|title=(Non)comparative politics in Britain|journal=Politics|volume=26|issue=1|pages=29–37|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118602277/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105101016/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118602277/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-05|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2006.00248.x|s2cid=145654851}}</ref>

Comparative politics is significant because it helps people understand the nature and working of political frameworks around the world. There are many types of political systems worldwide according to the authentic, social, ethnic, racial, and social history. Indeed, even comparative constructions of political association shift starting with one country then onto the next. For instance, [[India]] and the United States are majority-rule nations; nonetheless, the U.S. has a liberal vote-based [[presidential system]] contrasted with the parliamentary system used in India. Even the political decision measure is more diverse in the United States when found in light of the Indian [[popular government]]. The United States has a president as their leader, while India has a [[prime minister]]. Relative legislative issues encourage us to comprehend these central contracts and how the two nations are altogether different regardless of being majority rule. This field of study is critical for the fields of international relations and conflict resolution. Near politics encourages international relations to clarify worldwide legislative issues and the present winning conditions worldwide. Although both are subfields of political science, comparative politics examines the causes of international strategy and the effect of worldwide approaches and frameworks on homegrown political conduct and working.

==History of the field==

[[Harry H. Eckstein]] traces the history of the field of comparative politics back to Aristotle, and sees a string of thinkers from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] and [[Montesquieu]], to [[Gaetano Mosca]] and [[Max Weber]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Robert Michels]], on to [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] - with his ''Modern Democracies'' (1921) - and [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] - with his ''Constitutional Government and Democracy'' (1937) - contributing to its history.<ref>Harry Eckstein, "A Perspective on Comparative Politics, Past and Present," pp. 3–32, in David Apter and Harry Eckstein (eds.), ''Comparative Politics: A Reader'' (New York: Free Press of Glencoe, 1963). [https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/24808_Ch_01.pdf]</ref>

===Two traditions reaching back to Aristotle and Plato===
[[Philippe C. Schmitter]] argues that the "family tree" of comparative politics has two main traditions: one, invented by Aristotle, that he calls "sociological constitutionalism"; a second, that he traced back to Plato, that he calls "legal constitutionalism"".<ref>Philippe C. Schmitter, “The Nature and Future of Comparative Politics.” ''European Political Science Review'' 1,1 (2009): 33–61, pp. 36-38. Schmitter's depiction of the "family tree" of comparative politics can be found here: https://www.eui.eu/Documents/DepartmentsCentres/SPS/Profiles/Schmitter/Thefamilytreeofcomppol.pdf</ref>

Schmitter places various scholars under each tradition:

* 1. ''Sociological constitutionalism'': Some classic scholars in this tradition are: "[[Polybius]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Lorenz von Stein]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Moisey Ostrogorsky|Moisei Ostrogorski]], [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], [[Robert Michels|Roberto Michels]], [[Gaetano Mosca]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], and [[Herbert Tingsten]]." Schmitter argues that, in the twentieth century, this tradition was known by the label of "historical [[political sociology]]" and included scholars such as "[[Stein Rokkan]], [[T.H. Marshall]], [[Reinhard Bendix]], [[Otto Kirchheimer]], [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], [[Juan José Linz|Juan Linz]], Hans Daalder, [[Mattei Dogan]], [[Shmuel Eisenstadt|S.N. Eisenstadt]], [[Harry H. Eckstein|Harry Eckstein]], and [[Dankwart Rustow]]."<ref>Philippe C. Schmitter, “The Nature and Future of Comparative Politics.” ''European Political Science Review'' 1,1 (2009): 33–61, p. 38.</ref>

* 2. ''Legal constitutionalism'': Some classic scholars in this tradition are: "[[Léon Duguit]], [[Georges Burdeau]], [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], [[A. Lawrence Lowell]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]]." Schmitter argues that in the twentieth century this tradition was continued by: "[[Maurice Duverger]], [[Herman Finer]], [[Samuel Finer]], [[Giovanni Sartori]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl J. Friedrich]], [[Samuel Beer]], [[Jean Blondel]], [[Ferdinand A. Hermens|F.A. Hermens]], and [[Klaus von Beyme]]."<ref>Philippe C. Schmitter, “The Nature and Future of Comparative Politics.” ''European Political Science Review'' 1,1 (2009): 33–61, p. 38.</ref> 

===Periodization as a field of political science===

[[Gerardo L. Munck]] offers the following periodization for the evolution of modern comparative politics, as a field of [[political science]] - understood as an [[academic discipline]] - in the United States:<ref>Gerardo L. Munck, "The Past and Present of Comparative Politics," pp. 32-59, in Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics'' (Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.415.8830&rep=rep1&type=pdf] Munck's periodization has been validated by Matthew Charles Wilson, "Trends in Political Science Research and the Progress of Comparative Politics," ''PS: Political Science & Politics'' 50(4)(2017): 979-984.</ref>

* 1. The Constitution of Political Science as a Discipline, 1880–1920
* 2. The [[Behavioralism|Behavioral Revolution]], 1921–66
* 3. The Post-Behavioral Period, 1967–88
* 4. The Second Scientific Revolution 1989–2005

===Contemporary patterns, 2000-present===

Since the turn of the century, several trends in the field can be detected.<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder “Comparative Politics at a Crossroad: Problems, Opportunities and Prospects from the North and South.” ''Política y Gobierno'' (Mexico) 26, 1 (2019): 139-58 [http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/pyg/v26n1/1665-2037-pyg-26-01-139.pdf]</ref>

* End of the pretense of rational choice theory to hegemonize the field
* Lack of a unifying [[metatheory]]
* Greater attention to [[causal inference]], and increased use of [[Experiment|experimental methods]].
* Continued use of observation methods, including qualitative methods.
* New concern with a "hegemony of methods" as theorizing is not given as much attention.

==Substantive areas of research==

By some definitions, comparative politics can be traced back to [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]], as [[Plato]]'s [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|The Politics]]''.

As a modern sub-discipline, comparative politics is constituted by research across a range of substantive areas, including the study of:

* Politics of [[democracy|democratic]] states
* Politics of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] states
* [[Public good (economics)|Public goods]] provision and distributive politics 
* [[Political violence]]
* [[Identity politics|Political identity]], including [[Ethnic conflict|ethnic]] and religious politics
* [[Democratization]] and [[regime change]]
* Elections and [[Electoral system|electoral]] and [[Political party|party systems]]
* Political economy of [[Economic development|development]]
* [[Collective action]]
* [[Voting behavior]]
* Origins of the [[State (polity)|state]]
* Comparative political [[institution]]s
* [[Political methodology|Methodologies]] for comparative political research

While many researchers, research regimes, and research institutions are identified according to the above categories or foci, it is not uncommon to claim geographic or country specialization as the differentiating category.

The division between comparative politics and international relations is artificial, as processes within nations shape international processes, and international processes shape processes within states.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Kopstein|first1=Jeffrey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDP8RVXvlUMC|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|last2=Lichbach|first2=Mark|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44604-4|pages=3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hurrell|first1=Andrew|last2=Menon|first2=Anand|date=1996|title=Politics like any other?

==Methodology==

While the name of the subfield suggests one methodological approach (''[[Mill's Methods|the comparative method]]''), political scientists in comparative politics use the same diversity of social scientific methods as scientists elsewhere in the field, including experiments,<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Gerber|first1 = Alan|last2 = Green|first2 = Donald|date = 2012|title = Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation|location = New York, NY|publisher = W.W.

===(Mill's) comparative method===
{{Main|Mill's Methods}}

* [[Most Similar Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Difference]]: This method consists in comparing very similar cases which only differ in the ''dependent variable'', on the assumption that this would make it easier to find those ''independent variables'' which explain the presence/absence of the dependent variable.<ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008">Anckar, Carsten. "On the Applicability of the Most Similar Systems Design and the Most Different Systems Design in Comparative Research." International Journal of Social Research Methodology 11.5 (2008): 389–401. Informaworld. Web. 20 June 2011.</ref>
* [[Most Different Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Similarity]]: This method consists in comparing very different cases, all of which however have in common the same ''dependent variable'', so that any other circumstance which is present in all the cases can be regarded as the ''independent variable''.<ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008"/>

===Subnational comparative analysis===
Since the turn of the century, many students of comparative politics have compared units within a country. Relatedly, there has been a growing discussion of what Richard O. Snyder calls the "subnational comparative method."<ref>Richard Snyder, “Scaling Down: The Subnational Comparative Method,” ''Studies in Comparative International Development,'' 36:1 (Spring 2001): 93-110; Agustina Giraudy, Eduardo Moncada, and Richard Snyder (eds.), ''Inside Countries: Subnational Research in Comparative Politics.''
