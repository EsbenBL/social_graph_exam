Andrey Korotayev has made important contributions to the following fields.

===Mathematical modeling and Cliodynamics===
[[File:clio.jpg|right|thumb|Clio—detail from ''[[The Art of Painting|The Allegory of Painting]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

====Global dynamics====
In this field he has proposed one of the most convincing mathematical explanations for [[Heinz von Foerster|von Foerster's]] [[Doomsday Equation]].<ref name=cliodynamics>{{cite book|author1=Korotayev A. |author2=Malkov A. |author3=Khaltourina D. |url=https://www.academia.edu/22215616|title=Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends|place=Moscow|publisher=URSS|year=2006}}</ref> In collaboration with his colleagues, Artemy Malkov and [[Daria Khaltourina]], he has shown that till the 1970s the [[hyperbolic growth]] of the [[world population]] was accompanied by [[quadratic function|quadratic]]-[[hyperbolic growth]] of the world GDP, and developed a number of [[mathematical model]]s describing both of these phenomena simultaneously; he has also described mathematically the [[World-system theory|World System]] withdrawal from the [[hyperbolic growth|blow-up regime]] observed in the recent decades.<ref name="cliodynamics.ru">See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006.</ref>

The hyperbolic growth of the [[world population]] and quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP observed till the 1970s have been correlated by him and his colleagues to a non-linear second order [[positive feedback]] between the [[demographic]] growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows: technological growth – increase in the [[carrying capacity]] of land for people – demographic growth – more people – more potential inventors – acceleration of technological growth – accelerating growth of the [[carrying capacity]] – the faster [[population growth]] – accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors – faster technological growth – hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.<ref>See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

Int. J.
Astrobiology 7 (2008) 177–182. As Francis Heylighen puts it, "an elegant example is the explanation by Korotayev of the hyperbolic growth of the world population until 1960.
In the model, population growth is initially modeled by a traditional logistic growth
equation, where population N starts by growing exponentially but then slows
down until it reaches the maximum value expressed by the carrying capacity of the
environment. This carrying capacity is proportional to the overall productivity of
technology, i.e. its ability to extract from the natural environment the resources
necessary for survival. In a second equation, the growth of technological productivity is considered to be proportional to the technology that is already there
(simple exponential growth), but also to the population number, under the simple
assumption that more individuals will discover more innovations. The authors shows that the two equations together produce a hyperbolic growth curve that mimics the observed historical growth of world population with a surprising accuracy (explaining over 99% of the variation for the period 500 BC–1962)" ({{cite book |author-link=Francis Heylighen |last=Heylighen |first=Francis |date=2007 |chapter=Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the Global Brain |chapter-url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf |editor1-link=George Modelski |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Modelski |editor2-first=Tessaleno |editor2-last=Devezas |editor3-first=William |editor3-last=Thompson |title=Globalization as evolutionary process: Modeling global change |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHKTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA284 |place=London | publisher=Routledge | series=Rethinking Globalizations |isbn=978-0-415-77361-4 |pages=284–335}} {{ISBN|978-1-135-97764-1}}.).</ref>

He has also shown that the world urban population growth curve has also up till recently followed a quadratic-hyperbolic pattern.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/22215616/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Secular_Cycles_and_Millennial_Trends ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS, 2006; The [[World-systems theory|World System]] urbanization dynamics.

====Social and biological macroevolution====
[[File:Phanerozoic Biodiversity.svg|300px|left|thumb|During the Phanerozoic the [[biodiversity]] shows a steady but not monotonic increase from near zero to several thousands of genera.]]

In collaboration with [[Alexander V. Markov]] he has demonstrated that a similar mathematical model can be developed to describe the [[Largest-scale trends in evolution|macrotrends]] of biological [[evolution]]. They have shown that changes in [[biodiversity]] through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with hyperbolic model (widely used in [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]]) than with [[Exponential growth|exponential]] and [[Logistic function|logistic]] models (traditionally used in [[population biology]] and extensively applied to [[fossil]] [[biodiversity]] as well). The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order [[positive feedback]]. The hyperbolic pattern of the world [[population growth]] has been demonstrated by Korotayev to arise from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of [[technological growth]]. According to Korotayev and Markov, the hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between the diversity and community structure [[complexity]]. They suggest that the similarity between the curves of [[biodiversity]] and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Alexander V |last1=Markov |first2=Andrey V |last2=Korotayev |year=2007 |title=Phanerozoic marine biodiversity follows a hyperbolic trend |journal=[[Palaeoworld]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=311–318 |doi=10.1016/j.palwor.2007.01.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18677962|year=2008|last1=Markov|first1=AV|last2= Korotaev|first2=AV|title=Hyperbolic growth of marine and continental biodiversity through the phanerozoic and community evolution|volume=69|issue=3|pages=175–94|journal=Zhurnal Obshchei Biologii}}</ref> Finally, Korotayev has demonstrated that the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic models]] of this type may be used to describe in a rather accurate way the overall growth of the planetary complexity of the Earth since 4 billion BC up to the present.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/36810724/The_21st_Century_Singularity_and_its_Big_History_Implications_A_re-analysis The 21st Century Singularity and its Big History Implications: A re-analysis].

====Cliodynamics and the study of the Arab Spring====
[[File:Cairo mosques.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cairo]].]]

In the field of [[cliodynamics]], Korotayev has developed a number of mathematical models of interaction between the very long-term, "millennial" hyperbolic trend dynamics of social [[system]]s and the shorter-term, "secular" (that is, observed at the scale of centuries), cyclical dynamics.<ref>{{Cite document|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c96x0p1|title=Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends|first1=Andrey V.|last1=Korotayev|first2=Artemy S.|last2=Malkov|first3=Daria A.|last3=Khaltourina|date=9 October 2006|via=escholarship.org}}</ref>

Of special importance is his study of the [[hypothesis]] that population pressure causes increased [[warfare]]. This hypothesis has been recently criticised on the empirical grounds. Both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. Korotayev, in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/41550406/Population_Dynamics_and_Internal_Warfare_A_Reconsideration Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603173842/http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=281&Itemid=1 |date=3 June 2016 }}. ''[[Social Evolution & History]]'' 5/2 (2006): 112–147.</ref> Population and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, Han and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: Korotayev and Turchin have found that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in [[phase (waves)|phase]] (with warfare peaks following population peaks). Furthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/41550406/Population_Dynamics_and_Internal_Warfare_A_Reconsideration Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603173842/http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=281&Itemid=1 |date=3 June 2016 }}.

Thus, Korotayev has demonstrated that the [[Malthusian trap]] tends to generate sociopolitical upheavals.<ref name="urss.ru"/> On the other hand, he has shown that the escape from the [[Malthusian trap]] is accompanied by another "trap" generating new sociopolitical upheavals (what he calls "a trap at the escape from the trap").<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.academia.edu/33247372/Egyptian_Revolution_A_Demographic_Structural_Analysis_Entelequia._Revista_Interdisciplinar_13_2011_139_169 Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis.

In collaboration with [[Daria Khaltourina]] he has made a significant contribution to the study of the factors of the [[Russian Cross|current Russian demographic crisis]]. They have demonstrated that post-Soviet Russia experiences one of the world's highest prevalence of alcohol-related problems, which contributes to high mortality rates in this region. Reduction in alcohol-related problems in Russia can have strong effects on mortality decline. They have analysed the plausibility of application of general principles of alcohol policy translated in the [[Russian Federation]]. Korotayev and Khaltourina have shown that alcohol policy approaches could be implemented in the same ways as they have been in other countries, and contributed to the development of alcohol control measures in this country. In addition, according to Korotayev, there should be special attention to decreasing distilled spirits consumption, illegal alcohol production, nonbeverage alcohol consumption, and enforcement of current governmental regulations.<ref>See, e.g., Korotayev A., [[Khaltourina D.]] [https://www.academia.edu/32754260/Russian_Demographic_Crisis_in_Cross-National_Perspective._In_Russia_and_Globalization._Baltimore_John_Hopkins_University_Press Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective.

Korotayev and his colleagues have demonstrated that [[Protestantism]] has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" (as was suggested by [[Max Weber]]) but rather through the promotion of literacy.<ref>Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px]] They draw attention to the fact that the ability to read was essential for [[Protestants]] (unlike [[Catholics]]) to perform their religious duty − to read the Bible. The reading of Holy Scripture was not necessary for Catholic laymen. The edict of the [[Council of Toulouse]] (1229) prohibited Catholic laity from possessing copies of the Bible. Soon after that, a decision by the [[Council of Tarragona]] spread this prohibition to ecclesiastic people as well.{{citation needed|date=July 2019|reason=I'm having trouble finding a cite on that last bit}} In 1408, the Oxford Synod absolutely prohibited translations of the Holy Scripture. From the very beginning, Protestant groups did not accept this prohibition. Thus, [[Martin Luther|Luther]] translated in 1522–1534 first the [[New Testament]], and then the [[Old Testament]], into German, so that any German-speaking person could read the Holy Scripture in his or her native language. Moreover, the Protestants viewed reading the Holy Scripture as a religious duty of any Christian. As a result, the level of literacy and education was, in general, higher for Protestants than it was for Catholics and for followers of other confessions that did not provide religious stimuli for learning literacy. Literate populations have many more opportunities to obtain and use the achievements of modernisation than illiterate ones and display greater innovative-activity levels, which correspond with opportunities for modernisation, development, and economic growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/characterizing-literacy/book226639|title=Characterizing Literacy|date=14 January 2020|website=SAGE Publications Inc}}</ref> Empirical tests performed by Korotayev and his colleagues have confirmed the presence of a rather strong and highly significant [[correlation]] between the early introduction of mass literacy and subsequent high rates of capitalist economic development.<ref>Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

===World-system analysis===
[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|left|The 11th century World System]]
Andrey Korotayev claims that the present-day [[world-system]] ("the World System"), which in the 2nd millennium CE encompassed the whole globe, originated in the 9th millennium BCE in direct connection with the [[Neolithic revolution]].<ref name=komkniga>{{cite book|author1=Korotayev A. |author2=Malkov A. |author3=Khaltourina D. |year=2006|url=https://www.academia.edu/32757085|title=Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth|place=Moscow|publisher=KomKniga|isbn= 5-484-00414-4}}</ref> According to Korotayev, the centre of this system was originally in West Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/143130/|title=Review of Social Macroevolution: Genesis and Transformation of the World System by Leonid Grinin and Andrey Korotayev |publisher=Social Studies|access-date=31 December 2013}}</ref>

In general, Korotayev and his colleagues have suggested a rather novel approach to the [[world-system]] analysis. Within this approach the main emphasis is moved to the generation and [[diffusion]] of [[innovation]]s. If a society borrows systematically important technological innovations, its [[evolution]] already cannot be considered as really independent, but should rather be considered as a part of a larger evolving entity, within which such innovations are systematically produced and diffused. The main idea of the world-system approach was to find the evolving unit. The basic idea was that it is impossible to account for the evolution of a single society without taking into consideration that it was a part of a larger whole. However, traditional world-system analysis concentrated on bulk-good movements, and core – periphery exploitation, somehow neglecting the above-mentioned dimension. However, according to Korotayev, the information [[wikt:network|network]] turns out to be the oldest mechanism of the World System integration, and remained extremely important throughout its whole history, remaining important up to the present. It seems to be even more important than the core – periphery [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] (for example, without taking this mechanism into consideration it appears impossible to account for such things as the demographic explosion in the 20th century, whose proximate cause was the dramatic decline of [[wikt:mortality|mortality]], but whose main ultimate cause was the diffusion of innovations produced almost exclusively within the World System core). This also suggests a redefinition of the World System core. Within the approach in question the core is not the World System zone, which exploits other zones, but rather the World System core is the zone with the highest innovation donor/recipient ratio, the principal innovation donor.<ref name=komkniga/>

[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|right|360px|Hyperbolic trend of the world population growth]]
Korotayev suggests that the hyperbolic trend observed for the world population growth after 10000 BCE does appear to be primarily a product of the growth of the World System.[http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/143130/ Articles from journals] The presence of the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] trend itself indicates that the major part of the entity in question had some systemic unity, and Korotayev insists that the evidence for this unity is readily available. Indeed, he shows that we have evidence for the systematic spread of major innovations (domesticated cereals, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, plow, wheel, copper, bronze, and later iron technology, and so on) throughout the whole North African – Eurasian [[Oikumene]] for a few millennia BCE. As a result, the evolution of societies of this part of the world already at this time cannot be regarded as truly independent. By the end of the 1st millennium BCE we observe a belt of cultures, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with an astonishingly similar level of cultural complexity characterised by agricultural production of wheat and other specific cereals, the breeding of cattle, sheep, and goats; use of the plow, iron metallurgy, and wheeled transport; development of professional armies and cavalries deploying rather similar weapons; elaborate bureaucracies, and [[Axial Age]] ideologies, and so on – this list could be extended for pages. A few millennia before, we would find another belt of societies strikingly similar in level and character of cultural complexity, stretching from the [[Balkans]] up to the [[Indus]] Valley outskirts. Korotayev interprets this as a tangible result of the World System's functioning.<ref>Korotayev A. V.

====General theory of social macroevolution====
In addition, it appears necessary to maintain that Korotayev's theory of the [[World-system|World System]] development suggests a novel approach to the formation of a general theory of social macroevolution. The approach prevalent in social evolutionism is based on the assumption that evolutionary regularities of simple systems are significantly simpler than the ones characteristic of complex systems. A rather logical outcome of this almost self-evident assumption is that one should first study the evolutionary regularities of simple systems and only after understanding them move to more complex ones, whereas Korotayev's findings suggest that the simplest regularities accounting for extremely large proportions of all the macrovariation can be found precisely for the largest possible [[system]] – the human world, and, hence, the study of [[sociocultural evolution]] should proceed from the detection of simple regularities of the development of the most [[complex systems]] to the study of the complex laws of the dynamics of simple social systems.<ref>Korotayev A.

===Cross-cultural studies===
[[File:Major religions distribution.png|thumb|Religions of the world]]
From a complexity perspective Korotayev's establishes a key point, that of the bifurcations of social and [[kinship]] organisation that coalesced historically around the differential practices of the major [[world religions]].<ref>{{cite document|url= https://www.academia.edu/37305025|author =Andrey Korotayev|title= World Religions and Social Evolution of the Old World Oikumene Civilizations: a Cross-Cultural Perspective|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press|Mellen Press]]|access-date=31 December 2013}}</ref> It draws on the World Cultural database and the world religion as well as other variables. The [[Murdock]]ian comparative approach, up to Korotayev, had developed to the point where the nonindependence of cultures was well-recognized, and ways of taking the larger configurations of cultural systems into account had been reckoned to lie, in the latest iteration, along lines of high-order proto-linguistic communities. Korotayev demonstrates the effects of breaking what might be seen as a ritual taboo of Murdockian comparison: Thou Shalt Not Code World Religion. By doing so, Korotayev releases the Murdockian spell that lingers over the comparative approach in anthropology, and goes on to demonstrate the powerful effects of world religious communities — dating from what [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]] calls the "[[Axial Age]]" (800–200&nbsp;BCE) – on the preservation and differentiation of distinctive social and political structures in [[Eurasia]]. His introduction and conclusion suggest that an objectivist natural history approach to human history, in which subjective factors are of local importance but fade out in terms of lasting effects over generations, is a valid approach to the "pre-Axial" condition of human societies, while a subjectivist history of consciousness is a necessary complement to the "post-Axial" condition. Korotayev succeeds in placing these two complementary approaches in context and showing their linkages in terms of how subjective and religious factors play out in human history alongside objective factors such as demography and ecology, each informing the other. He shows how it is impossible to arrive at valid inferential results from comparative approaches without an integration of the two, a situation he aptly calls "[[Galton]]'s opportunity" for those are of century-old critiques of the comparative method. The reader will be surprised at the depth of empirical comparative findings in this short book. Following [[Murray Leaf]]'s ''Man, Mind and Science'' (1974) this work is a major contribution to repair of the material/ideational rift in anthropology.

====Matrilocal vs. patrilocal residence====
[[File:Snake Goddess - Heraklion Achaeological Museum retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Snake Goddess – Heraklion Archaeological Museum.]]

One of his particular contributions in this field is connected with the classical anthropological issue of determinants of [[matrilocal]] versus [[patrilocal]] postmarital residence. Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence (e.g., [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Edward Tylor]], or [[George Peter Murdock]]) connected it with the sexual division of labour. However, to the moment when Korotayev's research in this field began, cross-cultural tests of this [[hypothesis]] using worldwide samples had failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. Korotayev's tests have shown that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general; however, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor. Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal [[polygyny]] which effectively destroys [[matrilocality]]. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e. g., through a multiple [[Regression analysis|regression]] model), division of labour turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock's hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labour and postmarital residence were basically correct, though, as has been shown by Korotayev, the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.<ref>See, e.g., Korotayev A.

====Unilineal descent and Christianization====
[[File:Kiev vasnetcov.jpg|thumb|upright|''The [[Baptism of Kiev]]ans'', a fresco by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]

Korotayev studies variables that are usually regarded as the main causes of the decline of [[unilineal descent]] organisation (statehood, class stratification and commercialisation), along with a variable that had never been regarded as such a cause – deep Christianization. He postulates that the traditionally accepted causes of the decline of unilineal descent organisation (statehood, class stratification, commercialisation) are less significant than deep Christianization. He also theorises that the presence of unilineal descent groups correlates negatively with communal democracy and is especially strong for complex traditional societies. Korotayev concludes that, because the communal democracy correlates positively with the supracommunal one, the Christianization of Europe might have contributed to the development of modern democracy by helping to destroy unilineal descent organisation in this region.<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://www.academia.edu/30721172|author =Andrey V.

===Sociopolitical systems in the Middle East and Africa===

====Origins of parallel-cousin marriage and the Afrasian Instability Zone====
[[Islam]]ization, along with an area's inclusion in the 8th-century Arab-Islamic [[Caliphate|Khalifate]] (and its persistence within the Islamic world) has been demonstrated by Korotayev to be a strong and significant predictor of [[parallel cousin]] (Father's Brother's Daughter – FBD) marriage. He has shown that while there is a clear functional connection between Islam and FBD marriage, the prescription to marry a FBD does not appear to be sufficient to persuade people to actually marry thus, even if the marriage brings with it economic advantages. According to Korotayev, a systematic acceptance of parallel-cousin marriage took place when Islamization occurred together with Arabization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Korotayev |first1=Andrey |title=Parallel-Cousin (FBD) Marriage, Islamization, and Arabization |journal=[[Ethnology (journal)|Ethnology]] |year= 2000 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=395–407 |doi=10.2307/3774053 |jstor=3774053}}</ref> This research further led to the discovery of the so-called Afrasian Instability Zone.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Korotayev | first1 = A. | last2 = Issaev | first2 = L. | last3 = Rudenko | first3 = M. | last4 = Shishkina | first4 = A. | last5 = Ivanov | first5 = E. | year = 2016 | title = Afrasian Instability Zone and Its Historical Background | url = https://www.academia.edu/30234449 | journal = Social Evolution & History | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 120–140 }}</ref>

Korotayev has also done (together with his colleagues Vladimir Klimenko and Dmitry Proussakov) a significant contribution to the study of the origins of [[Islam]]. Korotayev and his colleagues view the origins of [[Islam]] against the background of the 6th century Arabian socioecological [[crisis]] whose model is specified by Korotayev and his colleagues through the study of [[climatological]], seismological, volcanological and [[epidemiological]] history of the period. They find that most sociopolitical systems of the [[Arabs]] reacted to the socioecological crisis by getting rid of the rigid supratribal political structures (kingdoms and [[chiefdom]]s) which started posing a real threat to their very survival.

The decades of fighting which led to the destruction of the most of the Arabian kingdoms and [[chiefdom]]s (reflected in ''Ayyam al-'Arab'' tradition) led to the elaboration of some definite "antiroyal" freedom-loving tribal [[ethos]]. At the beginning of the 7th century a tribe which would recognise themselves as subjects of some terrestrial supratribal political authority, a "king", risked to lose its honour. However, this seems not to be applicable to the authority of another type, the "celestial" one. At the meantime the early 7th century evidences the merging of the [[Arabian]] tradition of prophecy and the Arabian Monotheist "Rahmanist" tradition which produced "the Arabian prophetic movement".

[[File:Madina Haram at evening.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] (the Mosque of the Prophet) in [[Medina]], Saudi Arabia, is the site of [[Muhammad]]'s tomb.]]

According to Korotayev, the Monotheist "Rahmanist" prophets appear to have represented a supratribal authority just of the type many [[Arab]] [[tribe]]s were looking for at this very time, which seems to explain to a certain extent those prophets' political success (including the extreme political success of [[Muhammad]]).<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://www.academia.edu/3510576|author1=Korotayev A. |author2=Klimenko V. |author3=Proussakov D. |title=Origins of Islam: Political-Anthropological and Environmental Context|journal=[[Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae]]|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=243–276}}</ref>
