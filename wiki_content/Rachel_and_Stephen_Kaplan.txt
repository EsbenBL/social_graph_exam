== About ==
Their work on "restorative environments" and [[Attention Restoration Theory]] influenced how [[landscape architecture|landscape]] and design professionals and others view humanity's relationship with nature. The Kaplans got involved in studying the effects of nature on people in the 1970s with a [[US Forest Service]] grant to evaluate a challenge program in Michigan's wilderness. This introduction went on to influence generations of environmental psychologists and designers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/09/dont-knock-donald-trump-for-playing-so-much-golf-heres-why|title=Don't knock Donald Trump for playing so much golf.

The Kaplans have found that too much focused [[attention]] on anything can lead to [[mental fatigue]] and such fatigue's remedy is found in exposure to nature. In order for nature to best work its relaxing effect it is preferable for a place to have a high fascination value. An environment that automatically pulls the viewer into it is most beneficial. The Kaplans' research has found that office workers with a view of nature were happier and healthier at work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Stephen|date=1995-09-01|title=The restorative benefits of nature: Toward an integrative framework|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–182|doi=10.1016/0272-4944(95)90001-2|issn=0272-4944|citeseerx=10.1.1.500.4202}}</ref> Exposure to natural environments of the most mundane sort has proven to lift people's moods and enhance their ability to mentally focus.

Recent research of the Kaplans has also shown that people that exercise and who walk outside in pleasant environments tend to walk longer than those who walk inside or around their neighborhoods.
