==Research on community power==
While studying at Oxford with [[Steven Lukes]], author of ''Power: a Radical View'' (1974), Gaventa developed a theoretical and methodological approach to the study of community power that has radically transformed community power studies in political sociology and opened a path for the legitimization of participatory research in mainstream sociology and political science. The book ''Global Citizen Action'', edited by Gaventa, is one such example. In an essay written for the book, Gaventa writes, "Since the 1970s many activists have heard and been guided by the adage 'think globally, act locally.' These essays would suggest the reverse: ''Think locally'' about the impacts of global institutions and global forces."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Global Citizen Action|last=Edwards, Michael and Gaventa, John|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1306643678|location=Boulder, CO|pages=276|oclc=878114577}}</ref> He used this skills to become an activist in and document series of national mining strikes across the United Kingdom, including the [[Three Day Week|1974 Wales miners' strike]].

Borrowing from Lukes, Gaventa identifies three analytical dimensions that are the proper study of social power.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=Power and powerlessness : quiescence and rebellion in an Appalachian valley|last=Gaventa, John|date=1982|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0252009851|oclc=318407245|url=https://archive.org/details/powerpowerlessne00john}}</ref> Each subsequent dimension is increasingly difficult to empirically observe using traditional political science methodologies, forcing Gaventa to synthesize various understandings of socialization into a cogent articulation of observable processes through which symbolic production is channeled within identifiable networks and communities.<ref name=":02"/> The "one-dimensional" approach involves direct empirical observations of openly contested public issues.<ref name=":02"/><ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=JC|date=2016|title=Extending Gaventa: A Foucauldian Analysis of Power and Powerlessness|url=https://mds.marshall.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1908&context=asa_conference}}</ref> It involves defining and framing these issues in terms of identifiable winners and losers, and reflects the traditional pluralist approach to the study of community power.<ref name=":02"/><ref name=":12"/> The "second dimension" involves the addition of what Gaventa calls the "mobilization of bias", through which [[cultural hegemony]] is both asserted and legitimized.<ref name=":02"/> This happens through the control of the agenda setting thanks to prior rules. Empirically, Gaventa's contribution is to develop a method for examining the various channels through which those in power transform concerns, claims, and potential challenges about inequitable outcomes into "non-decisions". The "third dimension" therefore adds the capacity to influence expectations about social outcomes by manipulating symbols and ideology so that inequities themselves become "non-issues."<ref name=":02"/>

Gaventa's articulation and empirical demonstration of the "three-dimensional" approach to the study of power has informed many disciplines and scholars about the nuances of social power and the processes of its legitimization, while also lending support to scholars and social change advocates who would find the sources and the solutions of social problems not in the dictates or preconceived notions held by social scientists, theologians, and philosophers, but in the narratives of the affected alienated populations.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Global Citizen Action|last=Edwards, Michael and Gaventa, John|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=1306643678|location=Boulder, CO|pages=276|oclc=878114577}}</ref><ref name=":02"/><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Citizen Action and National Policy Reform: Making Change Happen|last=Gaventa, John and McGee, Rosemary|publisher=Zed Books Ltd|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84813-385-3|location=New York|pages=1}}</ref> ''Citizen Action and National Policy Reform'' opens: "How can ordinary citizens - and the organizations and movements which they engage - make changes in national policies which affect their lives, and the lives of others around them?"<ref name=":3" /> This question, which is arguably the central question with which Gaventa is concerned, is answered through the theory Gaventa employs.<ref name=":2" /> In Gaventa's theory, methodological subjectivity allows the framing of a social problem, and a social solution, to arise from within the group, thereby empowering and better enabling the group to take collective action in the face of authorities' power to frame issues as non-issues in the public's mind.<ref name=":3" />

Because Gaventa's work draws so heavily upon Luke's "three-face" conception of power, his work has been critiqued by other sociologists and scholars of power.<ref name=":12"/> Abraham argues that Michel Foucault's analysis of power identifies a "fourth face" by which power acts, which postulates that, "postulates that power itself produces subjects, their interests, their prospects for resistance, and what they consider truth."<ref name=":12" /> Abraham writes,"had Gaventa also used the Foucauldian notion of power, then he would perhaps have found even more insights into power’s operations."<ref name=":12" />
