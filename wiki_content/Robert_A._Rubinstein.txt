==Organizations==
In 1983, Rubinstein was a founding member of the Commission on Peace and Human Rights of the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. He is co-chair of the commission, and from 2000—2004 he was editor of the commission’s official journal, Social Justice: Anthropology, Peace and Human Rights.

Textor and Family Prize for Anticipatory Anthropology from the American Anthropological Association [http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=12829&navItemNumber=771]
==Theories==
Rubinstein applies a multilevel theoretical perspective to examining aspects of human social life. Since proposing in 1984 the "Rule of Minimal Inclusion," in ''Science as Cognitive Process'' (which says that adequate accounts of human phenomena must include information about the adjacent levels of systemic organization to those at the level of the phenomenon investigated) Rubinstein has applied this perspective to a variety of areas.

He used this view to explore the variety of ways in which culture is important to [[peacekeeping]] operations. Beginning in the mid-1980s he published a series of articles that show how the success of peacekeeping missions are critically dependent upon understanding the culture of the people among whom the mission works, and the importance of understanding the organizational cultures of the agencies who work together in a mission.

He applies this view in medical anthropology where he has made theoretical contributions and also shown how [[Hierarchical linear modeling|multilevel analysis]] is critical for understanding racial and ethnic disparities in health.
