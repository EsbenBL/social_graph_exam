==Career and themes==
According to the University of Utah, whose College of Social and Behavioral Science lists Hammond among its distinguished alumni, "The distinguishing feature of his career was an ability to enrich academic research with insider perspective and knowledge obtained through carefully designed personal interviews with major and minor players".<ref name="uu">{{cite web | url=https://csbs.utah.edu/alumni/distinguished-alum.php | title=Distinguished Alumni | publisher=University of Utah | accessdate=January 7, 2018}}</ref>  In doing so, Hammond sought to develop a more discerning understanding of how organizational behavior and domestic political considerations affected all aspects of nuclear strategy and American foreign policy.<ref name="pitt-obit"/><ref name="dn-obit"/>

American historian [[Stanley Kutler]]'s work has characterized Hammond's 1961 book ''Organizing for Defense: The American Military Establishment in the 20th Century'' as "an excellent history of the development of defense organization through the Eisenhower administration".<ref>{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of the United States in the Twentieth Century, Volume 2 | editor-first=Stanley I. | editor-last=Kutler | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | year=1996 | page=618}}</ref>
National security author Mark D. Mandeles, speaking in 2013, said ''Organizing for Defense'' still "retained considerable relevance and importance today".<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/9593280 | first=Mark D. | last=Mandeles | title=Military Classics Seminar Review of Paul Y. Hammond, Organizing for Defense | publisher=Academia.edu | date=June 18, 2013}}</ref>
Writing for the journal ''Defense Analysis'' in 1989, Michael D. Yaffe wrote of the 1962 book ''Strategy, Politics, and Defense Budgets'', which Hammond was joint author of along with [[Warner R. Schilling]] and [[Glenn H. Snyder]], that 25 years later "their insights about defense planning still ring true" and that the book was a landmark of defense-policy literature.<ref name="yaffe">{{cite journal | title=Landmarks in Defense Literature: Strategy, Politics and Defense Budgets | first=Michael D. | last=Yaffe | journal=Defense Analysis | volume=5 | number=2 | date=Summer 1989 | pages=163–166| doi=10.1080/07430178908405394 }}</ref>  Hammond's part was a detailed, interviews-based analysis of the formulation of [[NSC 68]] that is regarded as a classic contribution that has not been surpassed in the years since.<ref name="dn-obit"/><ref>{{cite journal | title=Revisiting NSC 68 | first=Ken | last=Young | journal=Journal of Cold War Studies | volume=15 | number=1 | date=Winter 2013 | pages=3–33 <!-- at=10–11 -->| doi=10.1162/JCWS_a_00306 | s2cid=57564752 }}</ref>

Another prominent work of Hammond's was the 1975 textbook ''Cold War and Détente: The American Foreign Policy Process Since 1945'',<ref name="dn-obit"/><ref name="pitt-obit"/> which was a revision and updating of his 1969 text ''The Cold War Years: American Foreign Policy since 1945''.<ref name="rwmlovejr"/>  A review of it for ''[[The History Teacher]]'' stated that "High points of the book include analysis of the array of options available at critical times and description of the complex roles of various actors in deciding foreign policy in a democratic system."<ref name="rwmlovejr">{{cite journal | jstor=492121 | title=Reviewed Works | first=Robert Wm. Jr. | last=Love | journal=The History Teacher | volume=9 | number= 4 | date=August 1976 | pages= 677–679| doi=10.2307/492121 }}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}</ref>  In his texts Hammond disagreed with the "[[New Left]]" of American foreign policy revisionism and instead believed that the [[Cold War]] represented largely reasonable U.S. responses to Soviet provocations.<ref name="rwmlovejr"/>
