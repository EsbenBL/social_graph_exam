U. of California Press. For a summary, see pp. 201-202 in the 1999 edition of Being Mentally Ill. Scheff was commissioned by the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] to do a study of [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospitals]], but his findings were rejected. However, Waldie’s committee, counseled by Arthur Bolton, replicated Scheff’s study in California, forming the groundwork for the new law.</ref>
