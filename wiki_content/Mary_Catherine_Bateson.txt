Her dissertation examined linguistic patterns in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kassarjian|first=Mary Catherine|year=1963|title=A Study of Linguistic Patterning in Pre-Islamic Arabic Poetry|url=https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?context=L&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US&docid=01HVD_ALMA211891265960003941|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=3 January 2021|website=hollis.harvard.edu|language=en|isbn=9798643145431}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Bateson was married to Barkev Kassarjian, a professor of management at [[Babson College]], from 1960 until her death. They had one daughter, Sevanne Margaret (born 1969), an actress who works professionally under the name Sevanne Martin,{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} and two grandsons. Through her mother's side of the family, Bateson was also the cousin of [[Jeremy Steig]]<ref name=family/> as well as a niece of [[William Steig]] and [[Leo Rosten]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QegaBoxPOrsC&q=leo+rosten+william+steig&pg=PA88|title=Intertwined Lives|isbn=9780307773401|accessdate=24 November 2014|last1=Banner|first1=Lois W.|date=15 December 2010}}</ref>

Bateson died on January 2, 2021 in hospice near her home in [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]], age 81.<ref name="NYTobit">{{Cite web |last=Green |first=Penelope |date=January 14, 2021 |title=Mary Catherine Bateson Dies at 81; Anthropologist on Lives of Women |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/books/mary-catherine-bateson-dead.html |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> She had suffered from brain damage caused by a fall a few months earlier.<ref name=NYTobit/>

== Style of Writing ==
Bateson considers herself an “activist for peace and justice”<ref name=":0">{{Citation|title=CHAPTER TEN. Epilogue: Composing a Life|date=2010-12-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400835706.297|work=Karl Pearson|pages=297–314|place=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|access-date=2021-10-21}}</ref> and stresses the importance, in our years of “unanticipated longevity,”<ref name=":0"/> to continue to be willing to learn. At the beginning of Bateson's career she was a linguist that studied Arabic poetry. Until she shifted her focus from a professional interest in human patterns of communication to highly formalistic studies thus starting her career as an anthropologist. Changing focus in topics Bateson began to use her own life experience to write.<ref name=":0"/> Bateson uses her own experience as a woman, daughter, mother, scholar, and anthropologist, who has gone through many different situations, as a guide for her writings.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Marcie|date=2002-05-01|title=BATESON, Mary Catherine, FULL CIRCLES. OVERLAPPING LIVES: Culture and Generation in Transition|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/jcfs.33.2.312|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|volume=33|issue=2|pages=312–313|doi=10.3138/jcfs.33.2.312|issn=0047-2328}}</ref> Bateson liked to keep her readers engaged by having them question her ideology and entertain the readings own provoking thoughts with questions. She wrote in a similar style to journaling often using personal examples or quotes for ideas and observations.<ref name=":1" /> She also uses cross-cultural experiences of other individuals incorporated into her writings.<ref name=":1" />

One of Bateson’s first books was her memoir ''[[With a Daughter’s Eye]]'', reflecting about her life with her deceased parents [[Margaret Mead|Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|last2=Bateson|first2=Mary Catherine|last3=Bateson|first3=Gregory|last4=Mead|first4=Margaret|date=March 1986|title=With a Daughter's Eye: A Memoir of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/415615|journal=Language|volume=62|issue=1|pages=198|doi=10.2307/415615|issn=0097-8507}}</ref> The memoir created a path for self-discovery and enablement of experiences she incorporated into her writings for example her next book ''[[Composing a Life]]''.<ref name=":2">{{Citation|title=Information on women’s lives|date=2014-01-21|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315835129-12|work=Hardship & Health Womens Lives|pages=30–49|publisher=Routledge|access-date=2021-10-20}}</ref> Exploring ''[[Composing a Life]]'' shows how deeply connected Bateson’s own journey as a scholar as parallel to a world, she and other women faced overt sexism and female inferiority was occurring.<ref name=":2" /> She questioned the gender expectations and the misogynistic reality of the 1980s with her book using her own experience as a parallel. In all of Bateson’s work she uses this method to help fuel her writings. Many of her books are still being used as inspiration in feminist questioning gendered expectations.
