==Early life==
Ayesha Jalal was born in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] in 1956 to Hamid Jalal, a senior Pakistani civil servant and Zakia Jalal, who was Saadat Hasan Manto's wife Safia's sister. Therefore, she is related to the renowned [[Urdu]] fiction writer [[Saadat Hasan Manto]].<ref name=MF/><ref name=TheHindu/> She came to [[New York City]] at the age of 14 when her father was posted at the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations.

She obtained her BA, majoring in History and Political Science, from [[Wellesley College]], USA, and her doctorate in history from [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at [[University of Cambridge]], where she wrote her Ph.D. dissertation: 'Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for 
Pakistan'.<ref name=MF/>

==Career==
Ayesha Jalal has been Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1980–84), Leverhulme Fellow at the Center of South Asian Studies, Cambridge (1984–87), Fellow of the [[Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars]] in Washington, DC (1985–86), Academy Scholar at [[Harvard University]]'s Academy for International and Area Studies (1988–90), associate professor at [[Columbia University]]'s Department of History (1991-95).

Columbia University in City of New York |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/4/224/2349910/ |publisher=Justia |access-date=24 August 2021}}</ref> The suit was dismissed for lack of evidence of discrimination. <ref>{{cite web |title=Jalal v. Columbia University in City of New York |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/4/224/2349910/ |publisher=Justia |access-date=24 August 2021}}</ref>

Ayesha Jalal is among the most prominent American academics who write on the history of South Asia.<ref name=TheHindu/> In her book, ''The Sole Spokesman'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985 and 1994), Jalal gives her perspective of what happened in the years between the 1937 elections in [[British India]] and the [[Partition of India|Partition of the Indian subcontinent]], identifying the factors which led to the creation of Pakistan and provides new insights into the nature of the British transfer of power in India. In particular, she focuses on the role of [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]], the leader of  [[All-India Muslim League]], and the main proponent of the [[Two Nation Theory]] on which the demand for Pakistan was based. Jinnah claimed to be the sole spokesman of all the Indian Muslims, not only in provinces where they were in a majority but also in the provinces where they were in a minority. Yet given the political geography of the subcontinent, it was clear that there would always be as many Muslims outside a specifically Muslim state as inside it. This book investigates how Jinnah proposed to resolve the contradiction between assertions of a "separate Muslim nation" and the need for a strategy which could safeguard the interests of all Indian Muslims. It does so by identifying Jinnah's real political aims, the reasons why he was reluctant to bring them into the open, and his success or failure in achieving them.<ref name=TheHindu/>
