==Early life and education==
Myron Jules Gordon was born on October 15, 1920 to [[Ukrainian-Jewish]] parents who had settled in New York. He was raised in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] and [[Brooklyn]] by his parents, Jack, a salesman, and Eva, a pianist. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1941 with a degree in economics, after switching his major from journalism. He then served in the United States Army until 1946.<ref name="edwardsgm"/>

==Academic career==
Gordon held a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1941), a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Harvard University]] (1947), and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from Harvard (1952).  He was an assistant professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (1947–1952), then an associate professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1952–1962) and a professor at the [[University of Rochester]] (1962–1970) prior to joining the University of Toronto in 1970.<ref>[http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/~gordon/cv/gordon_cv_msie.htm Myron Gordon's Curriculum Vitae]</ref>  His contributions to the field of accounting (and the application of economics and mathematics to accounting) are especially significant and worthy to note.  As a leading author of accounting textbooks, he helped educate generations of accounting, business, and management students.

Gordon served as President of the [[American Finance Association]] in 1975–1976.  He was named a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1993, and received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree at McMaster University in 1993, and another at the University of Toronto in 2005.

== Personal life ==
During his time in the military, Gordon met and married his wife Helen Elizabeth Taylor, known as Betty. They had two sons, Joe and David. Though Gordon was of Ukrainian-Jewish descent and his wife was the daughter of Baptist missionaries, they became active members of the Unitarian Church.<ref name="edwardsgm" />

Gordon died in 2010 at the age of 89, after multiple strokes and general ill health.<ref name="edwardsgm">{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Frank|title=Hatched at MIT in 1959, the Gordon Equation soon grew into an important tool for investors|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/hatched-at-mit-in-1959-the-gordon-equation-soon-grew-into-an-important-tool-for-investors/article1389720/?page=all|access-date=May 26, 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|date=July 27, 2010}}</ref>
