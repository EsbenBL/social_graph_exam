==Early life and education==
Heinz Alfred Kissinger was born in [[Fürth, Bavaria]], in 1923 to a [[Jews in Germany|German-Jewish]] family.{{sfnp|Isaacson|1992|p=20}} His father Louis Kissinger (1887–1982) was a schoolteacher. His mother Paula (Stern) Kissinger (1901–1998), from [[Leutershausen]], was a homemaker.  His brother, Walter Kissinger, born in 1924, died in 2021 at 96. The surname Kissinger was adopted in 1817 by his great-great-grandfather Meyer Löb, after the Bavarian [[spa town]] of [[Bad Kissingen]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.br-online.de/land-und-leute/artikel/0506/02-kissinger/index.xml |title= Die Kissingers in Bad Kissingen |trans-title= The Kissingers in Bad Kissingen |publisher= Bayerischer Rundfunk |language= de |date=June 2, 2005 |access-date= February 3, 2007 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071018235610/http://www.br-online.de/land-und-leute/artikel/0506/02-kissinger/index.xml |archive-date=October 18, 2007 }}</ref> In his youth, Kissinger enjoyed playing [[Association football|soccer]]. He played for the youth team of [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth|SpVgg Fürth]], which was one of the nation's best clubs at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.espnfc.com/story/1022970/uli-hesse-go-furth-and-conquer |title=Go Furth and Conquer |publisher=[[ESPN Soccernet]] |date=February 17, 2012 |access-date=May 3, 2012 |last=Hesse |first=Uli}}</ref>

In 1938, when Kissinger was 15 years old, he and his family fled [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] as a result of [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution. During Nazi rule Kissinger and his friends were regularly harassed and beaten by [[Hitler Youth]] gangs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Henry Kissinger|url=https://www.biography.com/political-figure/henry-kissinger|access-date=November 23, 2020|website=Biography|language=en-us}}</ref> Kissinger sometimes defied the [[Racial segregation|segregation]] imposed by [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial laws]] by sneaking into [[Soccer-specific stadium|soccer stadiums]] to watch matches, often resulting in beatings from [[security guard]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kissinger: My Family Escaped the Horrors of the Holocaust by 'Just a Few Months'|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2015/06/05/kissinger-my-family-escaped-the-horrors-of-the-holocaust-by-just-a-few-months/|access-date=November 23, 2020|website=Algemeiner.com|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> As a result of the Nazis' anti-Semitic laws Kissinger was unable to gain admittance to the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|''Gymnasium'']], while his father was dismissed from his teaching job.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=New Books Explore Henry Kissinger's German Jewish Roots |date=June 29, 2007|url=https://www.dw.com/en/new-books-explore-henry-kissingers-german-jewish-roots/a-2649128|access-date=November 23, 2020|website=Deutsche Welle|language=en-GB}}</ref> The family briefly emigrated to London before arriving in New York City on September 5. Kissinger later downplayed the influence his experiences of Nazi persecution had on his policies, writing "Germany of my youth had a great deal of order and very little justice; it was not the sort of place likely to inspire devotion to order in the abstract." However, many scholars, including Kissinger's biographer [[Walter Isaacson]], have disagreed and argued that his experiences influenced the formation of his realist approach to foreign policy.<ref>Thomas A. Schwartz (2011) Henry Kissinger: Realism, Domestic Politics, and the Struggle Against Exceptionalism in American Foreign Policy, Diplomacy & Statecraft, 22:1, 121–141, DOI: 10.1080/09592296.2011.549746</ref>

Kissinger spent his high school years in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of [[Upper Manhattan]] as part of the German Jewish immigrant community that resided there at the time. Although Kissinger assimilated quickly into American culture, he never lost his pronounced [[East Franconian German|German accent]], due to childhood shyness that made him hesitant to speak.{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=37}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1198517217372&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Bygone Days: Complex Jew.

Following high school, Kissinger enrolled in the [[City College of New York]], studying [[accounting]]. He excelled academically as a part-time student, continuing to work while enrolled. His studies were interrupted in early 1943, when he was drafted into the [[United States Army|US Army]].{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=38}}

==Army experience==
Kissinger underwent basic training at Camp Croft in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. On June 19, 1943, while stationed in [[South Carolina]], at the age of 20 years, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] [[U.S.&nbsp;citizen]]. The [[United States Army|army]] sent him to study engineering at [[Lafayette College]], [[Pennsylvania]], but the program was canceled, and Kissinger was reassigned to the [[84th Division (United States)|84th Infantry Division]]. There, he made the acquaintance of [[Fritz G. A. Kraemer|Fritz Kraemer]], a fellow immigrant from Germany who noted Kissinger's fluency in German and his intellect, and arranged for him to be assigned to the [[military intelligence]] section of the division. Kissinger saw combat with the division, and volunteered for hazardous intelligence duties during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|pp=39–48}}

During the American advance into Germany, Kissinger, only a [[Private (rank)#United States Army|private]], was put in charge of the administration of the city of [[Krefeld]], owing to a lack of German speakers on the division's intelligence staff. Within eight days he had established a civilian administration.{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=48}} Kissinger was then reassigned to the [[Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC), where he became a [[United States Army Counterintelligence|CIC Special Agent]] holding the enlisted rank of [[sergeant]]. He was given charge of a team in [[Hanover]] assigned to tracking down [[Gestapo]] officers and other saboteurs, for which he was awarded the [[Bronze Star]].{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=49}} In June 1945, Kissinger was made commandant of the [[Bensheim]] metro CIC detachment, [[Bergstrasse (district)|Bergstrasse]] district of [[Hesse]], with responsibility for [[de-Nazification]] of the district. Although he possessed absolute authority and powers of arrest, Kissinger took care to avoid abuses against the local population by his command.{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=53}}

In 1946, Kissinger was reassigned to teach at the European Command Intelligence School at [[Camp King]] and, as a civilian employee following his separation from the army, continued to serve in this role.{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=55}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1138.html |title=Henry Kissinger at Large, Part One |date=January 29, 2004 |publisher=[[PBS]] |access-date=February 13, 2016}}</ref>

Notably, Kissinger's ''primat der aussenpolitik'' approach to diplomacy took it for granted that as long as the decision-makers in the major states were willing to accept the international order, then it is "legitimate" with questions of public opinion and morality dismissed as irrelevant.<ref name="Buchan"/>

Kissinger remained at Harvard as a member of the faculty in the Department of Government where he served as the director of the Harvard International Seminar between 1951 and 1971.

Historian [[David Rothkopf]] has looked at the personalities of Nixon and Kissinger, saying:
<blockquote>They were a fascinating pair. In a way, they complemented each other perfectly. Kissinger was the charming and worldly Mr. Outside who provided the grace and intellectual-establishment respectability that Nixon lacked, disdained and aspired to. Kissinger was an international citizen. Nixon very much a classic American. Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times, Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies. Kissinger would, of course, say that he was not political like Nixon—but in fact he was just as political as Nixon, just as calculating, just as relentlessly ambitious ... these self-made men were driven as much by their need for approval and their neuroses as by their strengths.<ref>David Rothkopf, ''Running the world: the inside story of the National Security Council and the architects of American foreign policy'' (2004), pp. 111–12.</ref></blockquote>

A proponent of ''[[Realpolitik]]'', Kissinger played a dominant role in [[United States foreign policy]] between 1969 and 1977. In that period, he extended the policy of ''[[détente]]''. This policy led to a significant relaxation in US–Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. The talks concluded with a [[rapprochement]] between the United States and China, and the formation of a new strategic anti-Soviet Sino-American alignment. He was jointly awarded the 1973 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[Lê Đức Thọ]] for helping to establish a [[ceasefire]] and U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. The ceasefire, however, was not durable.<ref name="ceasefire"/> Thọ declined to accept the award<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1973 – Henry Kissinger, Le Duc Tho |publisher=NobelPrize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/tho-facts.html |access-date=March 15, 2015}}</ref> and Kissinger appeared deeply ambivalent about it - he donated his prize money to charity, did not attend the award ceremony, and later offered to return his prize medal.<sup>[[Nobel Peace Prize#cite note-:0-40|[40]]]</sup> As National Security Advisor in 1974, Kissinger directed the much-debated [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]].

[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|left|Kissinger, shown here with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]], negotiated rapprochement with China.]]
Kissinger initially had little interest in China when he began his work as National Security Adviser in 1969, and the driving force behind the rapprochement with China was Nixon.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bernkopf Tucker|first=Nancy|author-link=Nancy Bernkopf Tucker|title=Taiwan Expendable?

Kissinger made two trips to China in July and October 1971 (the first of which was made in secret) to confer with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], then in charge of [[Foreign relations of China|Chinese foreign policy]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Dube |first=Clayton |title=Getting to Beijing: Henry Kissinger's Secret 1971 Trip |url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2483 |publisher=USC U.S.-China Institute |access-date=July 21, 2011}}</ref> During his visit to [[Beijing]], the main issue turned out to be [[Taiwan]], as Zhou demanded the United States recognize that Taiwan was a legitimate part of China, pull [[United States Taiwan Defense Command|U.S. forces]] out of Taiwan, and end military support for the [[Kuomintang]] regime.{{sfn|Bernkopf Tucker|2005|p=122}} Kissinger gave way by promising to pull U.S. forces out of Taiwan, saying two-thirds would be pulled out when the Vietnam war ended and the rest to be pulled out as [[China–United States relations|Sino-American relations]] improved.{{sfn|Bernkopf Tucker|2005}}

In October 1971, as Kissinger was making his second trip to the People's Republic, the issue of which Chinese government deserved to be represented in the [[United Nations]] came up again.{{sfn|Bernkopf Tucker|2005|pp=128–130}} Out of concern to not be seen abandoning an ally, the United States tried to promote a compromise under which both Chinese regimes would be UN members, although Kissinger called it "an essentially doomed rearguard action".{{sfn|Bernkopf Tucker|2005|p=130}} While American ambassador to the UN [[George H. W. Bush]] was lobbying for the "two Chinas" formula, Kissinger was removing favorable references to Taiwan from a speech that Rogers was preparing, as he expected China to be expelled from the UN.{{sfn|Bernkopf Tucker|2005|p=131}} During his second visit to Beijing, Kissinger told Zhou that according to a public opinion poll 62% of Americans wanted Taiwan to remain a UN member, and asked him to consider the "two Chinas" compromise to avoid offending American public opinion.{{sfn|Bernkopf Tucker|2005|p=132}} Zhou responded with his claim that the People's Republic was the legitimate government of all China and no compromise was possible with the Taiwan issue.{{sfn|Bernkopf Tucker|2005}}  Kissinger said that the United States could not totally sever ties with Chiang, who had been an ally in World War II. Kissinger told Nixon that Bush was "too soft and not sophisticated" enough to properly represent the United States at the UN, and expressed no anger when the UN General Assembly voted to expel Taiwan and give China's seat on the UN Security Council to the People's Republic.{{sfn|Bernkopf Tucker|2005}}

His trips paved the way for the groundbreaking [[1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China|1972 summit]] between Nixon, Zhou, and [[Communist Party of China]] Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], as well as the [[Sino-American relations|formalization of relations]] between the two countries, ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility. The result was the formation of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States. Kissinger's diplomacy led to economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides and the establishment of [[De facto embassy#China and the United States|"liaison offices"]] in the Chinese and American capitals, though full normalization of relations with China would not occur until 1979.

===Vietnam War===
{{Main|Vietnam War|Henry Kissinger and the Vietnam war}}

[[File:Meeting at Camp David to discuss the Vietnam situation - NARA - 194466.tif|thumb|right|Kissinger and President [[Richard Nixon]] discussing the Vietnam situation in [[Camp David]], 1972 (with [[Alexander Haig]]).]]
Kissinger's involvement in [[Indochina]] started prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon. While still at Harvard, he had worked as a consultant on foreign policy to both the [[White House]] and State Department. In a 1967 peace initiative, he would mediate between Washington and [[Hanoi]].{{cn|date=October 2021}}

When he came into office in 1969, Kissinger favored a negotiating strategy under which the United States and [[North Vietnam]] would sign an armistice and agreed to pull their troops out of [[South Vietnam]] while the South Vietnamese government and the [[Viet Cong]] were to agree to a coalition government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} Kissinger had doubts about Nixon's theory of "[[Linkage (policy)|linkage]]", believing that this would give the Soviet Union leverage over the United States and unlike Nixon was less concerned about the ultimate fate of South Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=588–589}} Though Kissinger did not regard South Vietnam as important in its own right, he believed it was necessary to support South Vietnam to maintain the United States as a global power, believing that none of America's allies would trust the United States if South Vietnam were abandoned too quickly.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}

In early 1969, Kissinger was opposed to the plans for [[Operation Menu]], the bombing of Cambodia, fearing that Nixon was acting rashly with no plans for the diplomatic fall-out, but on March 16, 1969. Nixon announced the bombing would start the next day.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=591}} As he saw the president was committed, he became more and more supportive.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} Kissinger would play a key role in bombing Cambodia to disrupt raids into South Vietnam from Cambodia, as well as the 1970 [[Cambodian Incursion]] and subsequent widespread bombing of [[Khmer Rouge]] targets in Cambodia.

The Paris peace talks had become stalemated by late 1969 owing to the obstructionism of the South Vietnamese delegation.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=624}} The South Vietnamese President [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]] did not want the United States to withdraw from Vietnam, and out of frustration with him, Kissinger decided to begin secret peace talks with Thọ in Paris parallel to the official talks that the South Vietnamese were unaware of.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}}

In June 1971, Kissinger supported Nixon's effort to ban the [[Pentagon Papers]] saying the "hemorrhage of state secrets" to the media was making diplomacy impossible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}}

On August 1, 1972, Kissinger met Thọ again in Paris, and for first time, he seemed willing to compromise, saying that political and military terms of an armistice could be treated separately and hinted that his government was no longer willing to make the overthrow of Thiệu a precondition.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}}

On the evening of October 8, 1972, at a secret meeting of Kissinger and Thọ in Paris&nbsp;came the decisive breakthrough in the talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=647–648}} Thọ began with "a very realistic and very simple proposal" for a ceasefire that would see the Americans pull all their forces out of Vietnam in exchange for the release of all the POWs in North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Kissinger accepted Thọ's offer as the best deal possible, saying that the "mutual withdrawal formula" had to be abandoned as it been "unobtainable through ten years of war&nbsp;... We could not make it a condition for a final settlement. We had long passed that threshold".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}

In the fall of 1972, both Kissinger and Nixon were frustrated with Thiệu's refusal to accept any sort of peace deal calling for withdrawal of American forces.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} On October 21 Kissinger and the American ambassador [[Ellsworth Bunker]] arrived in Saigon to show Thiệu the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Thiệu refused to sign the peace agreement and demanded very extensive amendments that Kissinger reported to Nixon "verge on insanity".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}}

Though Nixon had initially supported Kissinger against Thiệu, [[H.R. Haldeman]] and [[John Ehrlichman]] urged him to reconsider, arguing that Thiệu's objections had merit.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Nixon wanted 69 amendments to the draft peace agreement included in the final treaty, and ordered Kissinger back to Paris to force Thọ to accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger regarded Nixon's 69 amendments as "preposterous" as he knew Thọ would never accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} As expected, Thọ refused to consider any of the 69 amendments, and on December 13, 1972, left Paris for Hanoi.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Kissinger by this stage was worked up into a state of fury after Thọ walked out of the Paris talks and told Nixon: "They're just a bunch of shits. Tawdry, filthy shits".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}}

On January 8, 1973, Kissinger and Thọ met again in Paris and the next day reached an agreement, which in main points was essentially the same as the one Nixon had rejected in October with only cosmetic concessions to the Americans.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652–653}} Thiệu once again rejected the peace agreement, only to receive an ultimatum from Nixon which caused Thiệu to reluctantly accept the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}} On January 27, 1973, Kissinger and Thọ signed a peace agreement that called for the complete withdrawal of all U.S forces from Vietnam by March in exchange for North Vietnam freeing all the U.S POWs.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}}

Along with Thọ,  Kissinger was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] on December 10, 1973, for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the [[Paris Peace Accords]] on "Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam", signed the previous January.<ref name="ceasefire">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1973 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/press.html |access-date=December 31, 2006}}</ref> According to [[Irwin Abrams]], this prize was the most controversial to date.

===Bangladesh Liberation War===

[[File:Henry Kissinger.png|right|thumb|Kissinger in the West Wing as National Security Adviser]]

Nixon supported Pakistani dictator, General [[Yahya Khan]], in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Kissinger sneered at people who "bleed" for "the dying [[Bengalis]]" and ignored the first telegram from the United States consul general in [[East Pakistan]], [[Archer Blood|Archer K. Blood]], and 20 members of his staff, which informed the US that their allies [[West Pakistan]] were undertaking, in Blood's words, "a selective genocide" targeting the Bengali intelligentsia, supporters of independence for East Pakistan, and the Hindu minority.<ref>{{cite web|title=Selective Genocide|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/BEBB1.pdf|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> In the second, more famous, [[Blood telegram#The Blood telegram|Blood Telegram]] the word [[genocide]] was again used to describe the events, and further that with its continuing support for West Pakistan the US government had "evidenced [...] moral bankruptcy".<ref name=BloodTelegram>{{cite web|title=Dissent from US Policy towards East Pakistan|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/BEBB8.pdf|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref>

Kissinger was particularly concerned about the expansion of Soviet influence in the [[Indian subcontinent]] as a result of a treaty of friendship recently signed by India and the [[USSR]], and sought to demonstrate to the People's Republic of China (Pakistan's ally and an enemy of both India and the USSR) the value of a tacit alliance with the United States.<ref name="nixonarchive">{{cite web |title=The Tilt: The U.S. and the South Asian Crisis of 1971 |publisher=National Security Archive |date=December 16, 2002 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/ |access-date=December 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=nytPak>{{cite news|last=Bass|first=Gary|title=Nixon and Kissinger's Forgotten Shame|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/nixon-and-kissingers-forgotten-shame.html|access-date=May 27, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name=bbcPak>{{cite news|last=Dymond|first=Jonny|title=The Blood Telegram|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0183r3l|access-date=May 27, 2014|publisher=BBC Radio|date=December 11, 2011}}</ref>

Kissinger had also come under fire for private comments he made to Nixon during the Bangladesh–Pakistan War in which he described Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] as a "[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]" and a "[[witch]]".

===Europe===
As National Security Adviser under Nixon, Kissinger pioneered the policy of ''[[détente]]'' with the [[Soviet Union]], seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers. As a part of this strategy, he negotiated the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (culminating in the [[SALT I treaty]]) and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] with [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]. Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Johnson Administration but were postponed in protest upon the [[Prague Spring|invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968.

Nixon felt his administration had neglected relations with the [[Western Europe|Western European]] states in his first term and in September 1972 decided that if he was reelected that 1973 would be the "Year of Europe" as the United States would focus on relations with the states of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) which had emerged as a serious economic rival by 1970.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US–UK relations in the era of détente, 1969–77|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pages=75–76|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> Applying his favorite "linkage" concept, Nixon intended henceforward economic relations with Europe would not be severed from security relations, and if the EEC states wanted changes in American tariff and monetary policies, the price would be defense spending on their part.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US–UK relations in the era of détente, 1969–77|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pages=75–76|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> Kissinger in particular as part of the "Year of Europe" wanted to "revitalize" NATO, which he called a "decaying" alliance as he believed that there was nothing at present to stop the [[Red Army]] from overrunning Western Europe in a conventional forces conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US–UK relations in the era of détente, 1969–77|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pages=75–76|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> The "linkage" concept more applied to the question of security as Kissinger noted that the United States was going to sacrifice NATO for the sake of "[[Citrus|citrus fruits]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US–UK relations in the era of détente, 1969–77|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|page=78|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref>

===Israeli policy and Soviet Jewry===

[[File:President Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, meeting in the Oval Office 1973.gif|thumb|right|Kissinger sits in the Oval Office with President Nixon and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, 1973]]

According to notes taken by [[H.R. Haldeman]], Nixon "ordered his aides to exclude all [[American Jews|Jewish-Americans]] from policy-making on Israel", including Kissinger.<ref name=Chait>[[Jonathan Chait|Chait, Jonathan]] (December 10, 2010) [http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/79829/nixon-disallowed-jewish-advisors-discussing-israel-policy Nixon Disallowed Jewish Advisors From Discussing Israel Policy], ''[[The New Republic]]''</ref> One note quotes Nixon as saying "get K. [Kissinger] out of the play—[[Alexander Haig|Haig]] handle it".<ref name=Chait/>

In 1973, Kissinger did not feel that pressing the Soviet Union concerning the plight of [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Jews being persecuted there]] was in the interest of U.S. foreign policy. In conversation with Nixon shortly after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] on March 1, 1973, Kissinger stated, "The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy, and if they put Jews into [[Gas chamber|gas chambers]] in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern."<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |title=In Tapes, Nixon Rails About Jews and Blacks |work=The New York Times |date= December 10, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/us/politics/11nixon.html }}</ref>

===Arab–Israeli dispute===
{{Main|Yom Kippur War}}
In September 1973, Nixon fired Rogers as Secretary of State and replaced him with Kissinger. He would later state he had not been given enough time to know the Middle East as he settled into the State Department.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=402}} Kissinger later admitted that he was so engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the [[Egypt–Saudi Arabia relations|Egyptian-Saudi alliance]]. Sadat expected as a reward that the United States would respond by pressuring Israel to return the Sinai to Egypt, but after receiving no response from the United States, by November 1972 Sadat moved again closer to the Soviet Union, buying a massive amount of Soviet arms for a war he planned to launch against Israel in 1973.

Kissinger delayed telling President Richard Nixon about the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 to keep him from interfering.

Kissinger promised the Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] that the United States would replace its losses in equipment after the war, but sought initially to delay arm shipments to Israel, as he believed it would improve the odds of making peace along the lines of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]].{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} In 1973, Meir requested $850 million worth of American arms and equipment to replace its material losses.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=409–410}} Nixon instead sent some $2 billion worth.<ref>Arnon Gutfeld and Boaz Vanetik.

On November 7, 1973, Kissinger flew to [[Riyadh]] to meet King Faisal and to ask him to end the oil embargo in exchange for promising to be "even handed" in the Arab-Israeli dispute.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} Despite all of Kissinger's efforts to charm him, Faisal refused to end the oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=418–419}} Only on March 19, 1974, did the king end the oil embargo, after Sadat reported to him that the United States was being more "even handed" and after Kissinger had promised to sell Saudi Arabia weapons that it had previously denied under the grounds that they might be used against Israel.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=420–421}}

Kissinger pressured the Israelis to [[cede]] some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors, contributing to the first phases of Israeli–Egyptian non-aggression. In 1973–74, Kissinger engaged in "shuttle diplomacy" flying between [[Tel Aviv]], [[Cairo]], and [[Damascus]] in a bid to make the armistice the basis of a preferment peace. Kissinger's first meeting with [[Hafez al-Assad]] lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes, causing the press to believe for a moment that he had been kidnapped by the Syrians.<ref name="Wright">{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Robin|title=The Assad Family: Nemesis to 9 U.S. Presidents|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=April 11, 2017|url= https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-assad-family-nemesis-of-nine-u-s-presidents?verso=true|access-date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>  In his memoirs, Kissinger described how, during the course of his 28 meetings in Damascus in 1973–74, Assad "negotiated tenaciously and daringly like a [[Riverboat casino|riverboat gambler]] to make sure he had exacted the last sliver of available concessions".<ref name="Wright" />

In contrast, Kissinger's negotiations with Sadat, though not without difficulties, were more fruitful. The move saw a warming in [[Foreign relations of Egypt#United States|U.S.–Egyptian relations]], bitter since the 1950s, as the country moved away from its former independent stance and into a close partnership with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

===Persian Gulf===
A major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the [[Persian Gulf]]. In April 1969, [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] came into conflict with [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] when Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] renounced the 1937 treaty governing the [[Shatt al-Arab|Shatt-al-Arab]] river.

===Turkish invasion of Cyprus===
{{See also|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}
Following a [[Greece–United States relations|period of steady relations]] between the U.S. Government and the [[Greek junta|Greek military regime]] after 1967, Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|coup]] by the Greek junta and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in July and August 1974. In an August 1974 edition of ''[[The New York Times]]'', it was revealed that Kissinger and State Department were informed in advance οf the impending coup by the Greek junta in [[Cyprus]]. Indeed, according to the journalist,<ref>Article republished on the front page of the Greek newspaper ''[[To Vima]]'', issue of August 2, 1974, article "The Americans knew there was plan to overthrow Makarios" [Οἱ Ἀμερικανοί ἐγνώριζον ὅτι ἑτοιμάζετο ἀνατροπή τοῦ Μακαρίου στήν Κύπρο] (photo-reprint in the book series {{cite book|title=To Vima – 90 years|publisher=Lambrakis Press |date=2012 |volume=Vol. XI ''1972–1981''}}</ref>) the official version of events as told by the State Department was that it felt it had to warn the Greek military regime not to carry out the coup. Kissinger was a target of [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American sentiment]] which was a significant feature of Greek public opinion at the time—particularly among young people—viewing the U.S. role in Cyprus as negative. In a demonstration by students in [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]],<ref name="Irakleion">Front page of the Greek newspaper [[To Vima]], issue of August 17, 1974, articles "The Cyprus crisis is Kissinger's Watergate" [Τό Κυπριακό εἶναι το Γουώτεργκέητ τοῦ κ.

[[File:Ford and Kissinger conversing, on grounds of White House, 16 Aug 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Ford and Kissinger conversing on the [[White House]] grounds, August 1974]]
The United States continued to recognize and maintain relationships with non-left-wing governments, democratic and authoritarian alike. [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Alliance for Progress]] was ended in 1973. In 1974, negotiations over a new settlement for the [[Panama Canal]] began, and they eventually led to the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]] and the handing over of the Canal to Panamanian control.

Kissinger initially supported the normalization of [[United States-Cuba relations]], broken since 1961 (all U.S.–Cuban trade was blocked in February 1962, a few weeks after the exclusion of Cuba from the [[Organization of American States]] because of U.S. pressure). However, he quickly changed his mind and followed Kennedy's policy. After the involvement of the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] in the independence struggles in [[Angolan War of Independence|Angola]] and [[Mozambican War of Independence|Mozambique]], Kissinger said that unless Cuba withdrew its forces relations would not be normalized. Cuba refused.

Chilean [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] presidential candidate [[Salvador Allende]] was elected by a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of 36.2 percent in 1970, causing serious concern in Washington, D.C., due to his openly socialist and pro-Cuban politics.

====Argentina====
{{See also|Dirty War}}
Kissinger took a similar line as he had toward Chile when the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic|Argentine Armed Forces]], led by [[Jorge Rafael Videla|Jorge Videla]], toppled the elected government of [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]] in 1976 with a process called the [[National Reorganization Process]] by the military, with which they consolidated power, launching brutal reprisals and "[[forced disappearance#Argentina|disappearances]]" against political opponents. An October 1987 investigative report in ''[[The Nation]]'' broke the story of how, in a June 1976 meeting in the Hotel Carrera in [[Santiago]], Kissinger gave the military junta in neighboring Argentina the "green light" for their own clandestine repression against leftwing guerrillas and other dissidents, thousands of whom were kept in more than 400 secret concentration camps before they were executed. During a meeting with Argentine foreign minister [[César Augusto Guzzetti]], Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally, but urged him to "get back to normal procedures" quickly before the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] reconvened and had a chance to consider sanctions.<ref>{{cite news |date= March 4, 2016| first=Martin Edwin |last=Andersen | title = How Much Did the US Know About the Kidnapping, Torture, and Murder of Over 20,000 People in Argentina? |work= The Nation |url= http://www.thenation.com/article/how-much-did-the-us-know-about-the-kidnapping-torture-and-murder-of-over-20000-people-in-argentina/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |editor-last=Osorio |editor-first=Carlos |editor2-last=Costar |editor2-first=Kathleen |title=Kissinger to the Argentine Generals in 1976: 'If There Are Things That Have To Be Done, You Should Do Them Quickly' |date=August 27, 2004 |work=[[National Security Archive]] |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB133/index.htm |access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |author-link=Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944) |title=Kissinger Approved Argentinian 'Dirty War' |date=December 5, 2003 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/06/argentina.usa |access-date=February 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Blakeley|first=Ruth|date=2009 |title=State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The North in the South|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415462402/|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rft8AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA96#v=onepage 96–97]|isbn=978-0415686174}}</ref>

As the article published in ''[[The Nation]]'' noted, as the state-sponsored terror mounted, conservative Republican U.S. Ambassador to Buenos Aires [[Robert C. Hill]] "'was shaken, he became very disturbed, by the case of the son of a thirty-year embassy employee, a student who was arrested, never to be seen again,' recalled former ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Juan de Onis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blogs/juan-de-onis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142254/http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blogs/juan-de-onis|archive-date=June 12, 2018|access-date=March 14, 2020|url-status=usurped}}</ref> 'Hill took a personal interest.'

In a letter to ''The Nation'' editor [[Victor Navasky]], protesting publication of the article, Kissinger claimed that: "At any rate, the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates." Yet Kissinger aide [[Harry W. Shlaudeman]] later disagreed with Kissinger, telling the oral historian William E. Knight of the [[Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]] Foreign Affairs Oral History Project: "It really came to a head when I was Assistant Secretary, or it began to come to a head, in the case of Argentina where the dirty war was in full flower. Bob Hill, who was Ambassador then in [[Buenos Aires]], a very conservative Republican politician—by no means liberal or anything of the kind, began to report quite effectively about what was going on, this slaughter of innocent civilians, supposedly innocent civilians—this vicious war that they were conducting, underground war. He, at one time in fact, sent me a back-channel telegram saying that the Foreign Minister, who had just come for a visit to Washington and had returned to Buenos Aires, had gloated to him that Kissinger had said nothing to him about human rights.

Navasky later wrote in his book about being confronted by Kissinger, "'Tell me, Mr. Navasky,' [Kissinger] said in his famous guttural tones, 'how is it that a short article in a obscure journal such as yours about a conversation that was supposed to have taken place years ago about something that did or didn't happen in Argentina resulted in sixty people holding placards denouncing me a few months ago at the airport when I got off the plane in [[Copenhagen]]?'"<ref name="Navasky book">{{Cite book |title=A matter of opinion |last=Navasky |first=Victor |date=2005 |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux |isbn=0374299978 |edition= 1st |location=New York |page=298 |oclc=56615627 }}</ref>

===Brazil's nuclear weapons program===
Kissinger was in favor of accommodating Brazil while it pursued a [[Brazil and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]] in the 1970s. Kissinger justified his position by arguing that Brazil was a U.S. ally and on the grounds that it would benefit private nuclear industry actors in the U.S. Kissinger's position on Brazil was out of sync with influential voices in the U.S. Congress, the State Department, and the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patti|first=Carlo|last2=Spektor|first2=Matias|date=2020|title=“We Are Not a Nonproliferation Agency”: Henry Kissinger's Failed Attempt to Accommodate Nuclear Brazil, 1974–1977|url=https://doi.org/10.1162/jcws_a_00940|journal=Journal of Cold War Studies|volume=22|issue=2|pages=58–93|doi=10.1162/jcws_a_00940|issn=1520-3972}}</ref>

===Rhodesia===
In September 1976, Kissinger was actively involved in negotiations regarding the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. Kissinger, along with South Africa's Prime Minister [[John Vorster]], pressured [[Rhodesia]]n Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] to hasten the transition to black [[majority rule]] in [[Rhodesia]]. With [[FRELIMO]] in control of [[Mozambique]] and even the [[apartheid]] regime of [[South Africa]] withdrawing its support, Rhodesia's isolation was nearly complete. According to Smith's autobiography, Kissinger told Smith of Mrs. Kissinger's admiration for him, but Smith stated that he thought Kissinger was asking him to sign Rhodesia's "death certificate". Kissinger, bringing the weight of the United States, and corralling other relevant parties to put pressure on Rhodesia, hastened the end of minority-rule.<ref name="Ian_Smith_memoir">{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Ian Douglas |title=Bitter Harvest: The Great Betrayal and the Dreadful Aftermath |year=2001 |publisher=[[Blake Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-903402-05-4 |oclc=1676807}}</ref>

The Portuguese decolonization process brought U.S. attention to the [[Portuguese Timor|former Portuguese colony]] of [[East Timor]], which declared its independence in 1975. Indonesian president [[Suharto]] regarded East Timor as rightfully part of Indonesia. In December 1975, Suharto discussed invasion plans during a meeting with Kissinger and President Ford in the Indonesian capital of [[Jakarta]]. Both Ford and Kissinger made clear that U.S. relations with Indonesia would remain strong and that it would not object to the proposed [[annexation]].<ref>{{cite web |editor-last=Burr |editor-first=William |editor2-last=Evans |editor2-first=Michael L. |title=Ford, Kissinger and the Indonesian Invasion, 1975–76 |date=December 6, 2001 |work=[[National Security Archive]] |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB62/ |access-date=February 13, 2016 |quote=Ford and Kissinger Gave Green Light to Indonesia's Invasion of East Timor, 1975: New Documents Detail Conversations with Suharto}}</ref> They only wanted it done "fast" and proposed that it be delayed until after they had returned to Washington.<ref>Agence France Press, "US Endorsed Indonesia's East Timor Invasion: Secret Documents", December 6, 2001</ref> Accordingly, Suharto delayed the operation for one day. Finally on December 7 [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian forces]] invaded the former Portuguese colony.

In February 1976, Kissinger considered launching air strikes against ports and military installations in Cuba, as well as deploying [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] battalions based at the US Navy base at [[Guantanamo Bay]], in retaliation for Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]]'s decision in late 1975 to [[Cuban intervention in Angola|send troops]] to newly independent [[Angola]] to help the [[MPLA]] in its fight against [[UNITA]] and [[South Africa]] during the start of the [[Angolan Civil War]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/29441281|title=Henry Kissinger 'considered Cuba air strikes' in 1976|work=BBC News}}</ref>

[[File:Ronald Reagan and Henry Kissinger.jpg|thumb|Kissinger meeting with President [[Ronald Reagan]] in the White House family quarters, 1981]]

After Nixon was forced to resign in the [[Watergate scandal]], Kissinger's influence in the new presidential administration of [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]] was diminished after he was replaced by [[Brent Scowcroft]] as National Security Advisor during the [[Halloween Massacre|"Halloween Massacre]]" cabinet reshuffle of November 1975.<ref>Wilentz, Sean (2008).

Kissinger continued to participate in policy groups, such as the [[Trilateral Commission]], and to maintain political consulting, speaking, and writing engagements. In 1976, he was secretly involved in thwarting efforts by the Carter administration to indict three Chilean intelligence agents for masterminding the 1976 [[assassination of Orlando Letelier]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dorfman|first=Zach|title=How Henry Kissinger Conspired Against a Sitting President|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/henry-kissinger-jimmy-carter-chile-214603|access-date=2021-08-27|website=POLITICO Magazine|language=en}}</ref> Kissinger was critical of the [[foreign policy of the Jimmy Carter administration]], saying in 1980 that  “has managed the extraordinary feat of having, at one and the same time, the worst relations with our allies, the worst relations with our adversaries, and the most serious upheavals in the [[Developing country|developing world]] since the end of the Second World War.”<ref>{{Citation|last=Gil|first=Troy|title=1980 Cleveland: “There You Go Again!” Defeating Defeatism— and Jimmy Carter|date=2013-12-31|url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400849307.24/html|work=Morning in America: How Ronald Reagan Invented the 1980's|pages=32|series=Politics and Society in Modern America|publisher=Princeton University Press|doi=10.1515/9781400849307.24|isbn=978-1-4008-4930-7|access-date=2021-11-24}}</ref>

After Kissinger left office in 1977, he was offered an endowed chair at [[Columbia University]].

In September 1989, the ''Wall Street Journal'''s John Fialka disclosed that Kissinger took a direct economic interest in US-China relations in March 1989 with the establishment of China Ventures, Inc., a Delaware limited partnership, of which he was chairman of the board and chief executive officer. A US$75 million investment in a joint venture with the Communist Party government's primary commercial vehicle at the time, [[CITIC Group|China International Trust & Investment Corporation (CITIC)]], was its purpose. Board members were major clients of Kissinger Associates. Kissinger was criticised for not disclosing his role in the venture when called upon by ABC's [[Peter Jennings]] to comment the morning after the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre|June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre]]. Kissinger's position was generally supportive of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s decision to use the military against the demonstrating students and he opposed [[economic sanctions]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Soley |first=Lawrence C. |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |title=The News Shapers: The Sources who Explain the News |year=1992 |page=?}}</ref>

From 1995 to 2001, Kissinger served on the board of directors for [[Freeport-McMoRan]], a [[multinational corporation|multinational]] copper and gold producer with significant mining and milling operations in [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dsVQx.b1sw.htm#1nhw|title=Freeport McMoran Inc. 10-K|date=March 31, 1994|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission|access-date=December 29, 2006}}</ref> In February 2000, then-president of Indonesia [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] appointed Kissinger as a political advisor.

In 1998, in response to the [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal]], the [[International Olympic Committee]] formed a commission, called the "2000 Commission," to recommend reforms, which Kissinger served on. This service led in 2000 to his appointment as one of five IOC "honor members," a category the organization described as granted to "eminent personalities from outside the IOC who have rendered particularly outstanding services to it."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wenn|first1=Stephen|first2=Robert|last2=Barney|first3=Scott|last3=Martyn|title=Tarnished Rings: The International Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake City Bid Scandal|location=Syracuse|publisher=Syracuse University Press|date=2011|pages=94, 111, 118, 123–124, 159}}</ref>

From 2000 to 2006, Kissinger served as chairman of the board of trustees of [[Eisenhower Fellowships]]. In 2006, upon his departure from Eisenhower Fellowships, he received the Dwight D.

[[File:President Trump Meets with Henry Kissinger (33787724293).jpg|thumb|left|President [[Donald Trump]] meeting with Kissinger on May 10, 2017]]

Kissinger—along with [[William Perry]], [[Sam Nunn]], and [[George Shultz]]—has called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' [[op-ed]]s proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] to advance this agenda. In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled ''[[Nuclear Tipping Point]]''. The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in the ''Wall Street Journal'' op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.

In December 2008, Kissinger was given the [[American Patriot Award]] by the [[National Defense University]] Foundation "in recognition for his distinguished career in public service."<ref name="Kissinger & Hill"/>

On November 17, 2016, Kissinger met with then [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Donald Trump]] during which they discussed global affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-holds-meetings-sc-gov-nikki-haley/story?id=43608308|title=Trump Holds Meetings With Haley, Kissinger and Sessions|date=November 17, 2016|website=ABC News|access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref> Kissinger also met with President Trump at the White House in May 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russian government releases photos of Oval Office meeting|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/politics/article/Russian-government-releases-photos-of-Oval-Office-11136149.php|work=Time Magazine|date=May 10, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511005610/http://www.sfgate.com/news/politics/article/Russian-government-releases-photos-of-Oval-Office-11136149.php|archive-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>

In an interview with [[Charlie Rose]] on August 17, 2017, Kissinger said about President Trump: "I'm hoping for an Augustinian moment, for [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] ... who in his early life followed a pattern that was quite incompatible with later on when he had a vision, and rose to [[Saint|sainthood]]. One does not expect the president to become that, but it's conceivable ...".<ref>"[https://charlierose.com/videos/30895 Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state, shares his thoughts on resolving the North Korea crisis, the U.S. relationship with China, and Donald Trump.]" August 17, 2017.</ref> Kissinger also argued that Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] wanted to weaken [[Hillary Clinton]], not elect Donald Trump.

===Views on U.S. foreign policy===

====Yugoslav wars====
[[File:White House meeting about New START Treaty.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] discussing the [[New START]] Treaty between the U.S. and Russia, 2010]]

In several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the [[Yugoslav wars]], he criticized the United States' policies in [[Southeast Europe]], among other things for the recognition of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as a sovereign state, which he described as a foolish act.<ref name="Rose7185">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/7185|title=Charlie Rose – A panel on the crisis in Bosnia|publisher=charlierose.com|date=November 28, 1994|access-date=October 16, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628234617/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/7185|archive-date=June 28, 2009}}</ref> Most importantly he dismissed the notion of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] being aggressors or separatist, saying that "they can't be separating from something that has never existed".<ref name="Rose6651">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/6651|title=Charlie Rose – An interview with Henry Kissinger|publisher=charlierose.com|date=September 14, 1995|access-date=October 16, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627141231/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/6651|archive-date=June 27, 2009}}</ref> In addition, he repeatedly warned the West against inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time, and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries.<ref name="Rose6651"/> Kissinger shared similarly critical views on [[Kosovo War|Western involvement]] in [[Kosovo]]. In particular, he held a disparaging view of the [[Rambouillet Agreement]]:

However, as the [[Serbs]] did not accept the Rambouillet text and [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombings started]], he opted for a continuation of the bombing as NATO's credibility was now at stake, but dismissed the use of ground forces, claiming that it was not worth it.<ref name="Rose4347">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/4347|title=Charlie Rose – An hour with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger|publisher=charlierose.com|date=April 12, 1999|access-date=October 16, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628234637/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/4347|archive-date=June 28, 2009}}</ref>

In an interview on the BBC's ''[[Andrew Marr Show|Sunday AM]]'' on November 19, 2006, Kissinger was asked whether there is any hope left for a clear military victory in Iraq and responded, "If you mean by 'military victory' an [[Federal government of Iraq|Iraqi government]] that can be established and whose writ runs across the whole country, that gets the [[Iraqi Civil War (2006–2008)|civil war]] under control and [[Sectarian violence in Iraq|sectarian violence]] under control in a time period that the political processes of the democracies will support, I don't believe that is possible. ...

He called for Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] and the incoming U.S. President-elect [[Joe Biden]] to take a less confrontational foreign policy.<ref>{{Cite news|date=November 16, 2020|title=Kissinger Warns Biden of U.S.–China Catastrophe on Scale of WWI|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/kissinger-warns-biden-of-u-s-china-catastrophe-on-scale-of-wwi|access-date=March 22, 2021}}</ref> Kissinger previously said that a potential war between China and the United States would be "worse than the [[world war]]s that ruined [[Culture of Europe|European civilization]]."<ref>{{Cite web|last=DeCambre|first=Mark|title=Kissinger says failure to mend U.S.-China trade relations would be 'worse than the world wars that ruined European civilization'|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kissinger-says-failure-to-mend-us-china-trade-relations-would-be-worse-than-the-world-wars-that-ruined-european-civilization-2019-11-15|access-date=March 22, 2021|website=MarketWatch|language=en-US}}</ref>

====Iran====
Kissinger's position on this issue of U.S.–Iran talks was reported by the ''[[Tehran Times]]'' to be that "Any direct talks between the U.S. and Iran on issues such as the nuclear dispute would be most likely to succeed if they first involved only diplomatic staff and progressed to the level of secretary of state before the heads of state meet."<ref>{{cite news|title=Kissinger backs direct U.S. negotiations with Iran|work=The Tehran Times|date=September 27, 2008|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=165193|access-date=September 27, 2008}} (Transcript of a [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg reportinterview]].)</ref> In 2016, Kissinger said that the biggest challenge facing the Middle East is the "potential domination of the region by an Iran that is both imperial and jihadist." He further wrote in August 2017 that if the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] of Iran and its Shiite allies were allowed to fill the territorial vacuum left by a militarily defeated [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], the region would be left with a land corridor extending from Iran to the Levant "which could mark the emergence of an Iranian radical empire."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/henry-kissinger-isis-iranian-radical-empire-middle-east-a7881541.html | title=Henry Kissinger warns destroying Isis could lead to 'Iranian radical empire' | newspaper=The Independent | date=August 7, 2017 | access-date=November 19, 2018 | author=Khan, Shehab}}</ref> Commenting on the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], Kissinger said that he wouldn't have agreed to it, but that Trump's plan to end the agreement after it was signed would "enable the Iranians to do more than us."<ref>{{cite news|title=Kissinger: To Prevent Regional Explosion, US Must Thwart Iranian Expansionism|work=[[The Algemeiner]]|date=November 11, 2016|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2016/11/11/kissinger-to-prevent-regional-explosion-us-must-thwart-iranian-expansionism/|access-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref>

====2014 Ukrainian crisis====
[[File:DIG13877 jjg-318.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Kissinger on April 26, 2016]]

On March 5, 2014, ''The Washington Post'' published an [[op-ed]] piece by Kissinger, 11 days before the [[2014 Crimean status referendum|Crimean referendum]] on whether [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] should officially rejoin [[Ukraine]] or join neighboring [[Russia]].<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/henry-kissinger-to-settle-the-ukraine-crisis-start-at-the-end/2014/03/05/46dad868-a496-11e3-8466-d34c451760b9_story.html|title=Henry Kissinger: To settle the Ukraine crisis, start at the end|author=Henry A. Kissinger|date=March 5, 2014|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> In it, he attempted to balance the Ukrainian, Russian and Western desires for a functional state. He made four main points:
# Ukraine should have the right to choose freely its economic and political associations, including with Europe;
# Ukraine should not join NATO, a repetition of the position he took seven years before;
# Ukraine should be free to create any government compatible with the expressed will of its people. Wise Ukrainian leaders would then opt for a policy of reconciliation between the various parts of their country. He imagined an international position for Ukraine like that of Finland.
# Ukraine should maintain sovereignty over Crimea.

Kissinger also wrote: "The west speaks Ukrainian; the east speaks mostly Russian. Any attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the other—as has been the pattern—would lead eventually to civil war or break up."<ref name="washingtonpost"/>

Following the publication of his book titled [[World Order (book)|''World Order'']], Kissinger participated in an interview with [[Charlie Rose]] and updated his position on Ukraine, which he sees as a possible geographical mediator between Russia and the West.<ref>Charlie Rose, PBS, September 2014.</ref> In a question he posed to himself for illustration regarding re-conceiving policy regarding Ukraine, Kissinger stated: "If Ukraine is considered an outpost, then the situation is that its eastern border is the NATO strategic line, and NATO will be within {{convert|200|mi|km}} of [[Volgograd]]. That will never be accepted by Russia. On the other hand, if the Russian western line is at the [[Borders of Poland|border of Poland]], Europe will be permanently disquieted. The Strategic objective should have been to see whether one can build Ukraine as a bridge between East and West, and whether one can do it as a kind of a joint effort."<ref>Charlie Rose, reported in Bloomberg BusinessWeek, p. 20, October 2, 2014.</ref>

In December 2016, Kissinger advised then [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Donald Trump]] to accept "Crimea as a part of Russia" in an attempt to secure a rapprochement between the United States and Russia, whose relations soured as a result of the Crimean crisis.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Buncombe|first1=Andrew|title=Henry Kissinger has 'advised Donald Trump to accept' Crimea as part of Russia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/henry-kissinger-russia-trump-crimea-advises-latest-ukraine-a7497646.html|website=The Independent|access-date=December 28, 2016|location=New York|date=December 27, 2016}}</ref> When asked if he explicitly considered Russia's sovereignty over Crimea legitimate, Kissinger answered in the affirmative, reversing the position he took in his ''Washington Post'' op-ed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kissinger advises Trump to accept Crimea as Russia – Bild|url=http://uatoday.tv/politics/kissinger-advises-trump-to-accept-crimea-as-russia-bild-854458.html|website=Ukraine Today|access-date=December 28, 2016|date=December 27, 2016}}</ref>

====Computers and nuclear weapons====
In 2019, Kissinger wrote about the increasing tendency to give control of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] to computers operating with [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) that: "Adversaries' ignorance of AI-developed configurations will become a strategic advantage".<ref name=AI>{{cite news|title=Artificial intelligence and war|work=[[The Economist]]|date=September 5, 2019|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/09/05/artificial-intelligence-and-war|access-date=January 3, 2020}}</ref> Kissinger argued that giving power to launch nuclear weapons to computers using algorithms to make decisions would eliminate the human factor and give the advantage to the state that had the most effective AI system as a computer can make decisions about war and peace far faster than any human ever could.<ref name=AI/> Just as an AI-enhanced computer can win chess games by anticipating human decision-making, an AI-enhanced computer could be useful in a crisis as in a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], the side that strikes first would have the advantage by destroying the opponent's nuclear capacity. Kissinger also noted there was always the danger that a computer would make a decision to start a nuclear war that before diplomacy had been exhausted or the algorithm controlling the AI might make a decision to start a nuclear war that would be not understandable to the operators.<ref name=Metamorphosis>{{cite news|title=The Metamorphosis|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=August 2019|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/henry-kissinger-the-metamorphosis-ai/592771/|access-date=January 3, 2020}}</ref> Kissinger also warned the use of AI to control nuclear weapons would impose "opacity" on the decision-making process as the algorithms that control the AI system are not readily understandable, destabilizing the decision-making process:
{{Quote|... grand strategy requires an understanding of the capabilities and military deployments of potential adversaries. But if more and more intelligence becomes opaque, how will policy makers understand the views and abilities of their adversaries and perhaps even allies? Will many different internets emerge or, in the end, only one? What will be the implications for cooperation? For confrontation? As AI becomes ubiquitous, new concepts for its security need to emerge.<ref name=Metamorphosis/>}}

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
On April 3, 2020, Kissinger shared his diagnostic view of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], saying that it threatens the "liberal world order". Kissinger added that the virus does not know borders although global leaders are trying to address the crisis on a mainly national basis. He stressed that the key is not a purely national effort but greater international cooperation.<ref name=alter/>

==Public perception==
At the height of Kissinger's prominence, many commented on his wit. In February 1972, at the [[National Press Club (USA)|Washington Press Club]] annual congressional dinner, "Kissinger mocked his reputation as a secret swinger."<ref name="TimeOffDuty">"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930070726/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905709,00.html Henry Kissinger Off Duty]." ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', February 7, 1972.</ref> The insight, "Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac", is widely attributed to him, although Kissinger was paraphrasing [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-12-26/features/0112250228_1_bill-and-monica-lewinsky-power-ultimate-aphrodisiac |title=Authors: Men's power is sexy, women's suspect |last1=O'Connell |first1=Loraine |date=December 26, 2001 |access-date=March 23, 2016}}</ref> Four scholars at the [[College of William & Mary]] ranked Kissinger as the most effective U.S. Secretary of State in the 50 years to 2015.<ref name="foreignpolicy"/> A number of activists and human rights lawyers, however, have sought his prosecution for alleged war crimes.<ref name="Times of Israel"/><ref name="Rohter"/> According to historian and Kissinger biographer [[Niall Ferguson]], however, accusing Kissinger alone of war crimes "requires a double standard" because "nearly all the secretaries of state&nbsp;... and nearly all the presidents" have taken similar actions.

Some have blamed Kissinger for injustices in American foreign policy during his tenure in government. In September 2001, relatives and survivors of General [[Rene Schneider]] (former head of the Chilean general staff) filed civil proceedings in Federal Court in Washington, DC, and, in April 2002, a petition for Kissinger's arrest was filed in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London by human rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petertatchell.net/international/united_states/kissinger.htm|title=Warrant Sought for the Arrest of Henry Kissinger|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913213251/http://www.petertatchell.net/international/united_states/kissinger.htm|archive-date=September 13, 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=December 5, 2015}}</ref> citing the destruction of civilian populations and the environment in Indochina during the years 1969–75.<ref name="Fairfax">[https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/29/1019441343996.html "Why the law wants a word with Kissinger"], [[Fairfax Digital]], April 30, 2002</ref> British-American journalist and author [[Christopher Hitchens]] authored ''[[The Trial of Henry Kissinger]]'', in which Hitchens calls for the prosecution of Kissinger "for [[War crime|war crimes]], for [[crimes against humanity]], and for offenses against [[Common law|common]] or [[Customary law|customary]] or [[international law]], including conspiracy to commit murder, kidnap, and torture".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|author-link=Christopher Hitchens|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=December 13, 2010|url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2010/12/how_can_anyone_defend_kissinger_now.html|title=How Can Anyone Defend Kissinger Now?|access-date=January 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|author-link=Christopher Hitchens|title=The Latest Kissinger Outrage|date=November 27, 2002|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=November 25, 2011|url= http://primary.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2002/11/the_latest_kissinger_outrage.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160101030037/http://primary.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2002/11/the_latest_kissinger_outrage.html|archive-date=January 1, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/200105140041 |title= Show us the papers, Hitchens |work= New Statesman |access-date= November 25, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313223638/http://www.newstatesman.com/200105140041 |archive-date= March 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|author-link=Christopher Hitchens|date=December 14, 2010|title=Latest Nixon Tape Buries Kissinger's Reputation|work=[[National Post]]|url=https://nationalpost.com/full-comment/christopher-hitchens-latest-nixon-tape-buries-kissingers-reputation|access-date=December 3, 2020}}</ref> Critics on the right, such as [[Ray Takeyh]], have faulted Kissinger for his role in the Nixon administration's opening to China and secret negotiations with North Vietnam.

[[File:Nixon tape of 6 October 1972 (decent interval).mp3|thumb|Nixon's and Kissinger's conversation on October 6, 1972]]
Historian [[Jeffrey Kimball (historian)|Jeffrey Kimball]] developed the theory that Kissinger and the Nixon administration accepted a South Vietnamese collapse provided a face-saving [[decent interval]] passed between American withdrawal and defeat.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Ken |title=Fatal Politics: The Nixon Tapes, the Vietnam War, and the Casualties of Reelection |date=2015 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |isbn=978-0-8139-3803-5 |language=en|page=118}}</ref> In his first meeting with [[Zhou Enlai]] in 1971, Kissinger "laid out in detail the settlement terms that would produce such a delayed defeat: total American withdrawal, return of all American POWs, and a ceasefire-in-place for '18 months or some period'", in the words of historian [[Ken Hughes (historian)|Ken Hughes]].{{sfn|Hughes|2015|p=118}} On October 6, 1972, Kissinger told Nixon twice that the terms of the Paris Peace Accords would probably destroy South Vietnam: "I also think that Thieu is right, that our terms will eventually destroy him."{{sfn|Hughes|2015|pp=123–124}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard Nixon and Henry A.

According to Kadura, the "decent interval" concept has been "largely misrepresented," in that Nixon and Kissinger "sought to gain time, make the North turn inward, and create a perpetual equilibrium" rather than acquiescing in the collapse of South Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kadura|first=Johannes|title=The War After the War: The Struggle for Credibility During America's Exit From Vietnam|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0801453960|pages=4, 153}}</ref>

* Kissinger and [[Le Duc Tho]] were jointly offered the 1973 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for their work on the [[Paris Peace Accords]] which prompted the withdrawal of American forces from the [[Vietnam war]].
