'''Frank Plumpton Ramsey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|m|z|i}}; 22 February 1903 – 19 January 1930) was a [[British people|British]] [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], and [[economist]] who made major contributions to all three fields before his death at the age of 26. He was a close friend of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and, as an undergraduate, translated Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' into English. He was also influential in persuading Wittgenstein to return to [[philosophy]] and Cambridge. Like Wittgenstein, he was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], the secret intellectual society, from 1921.

==Life==

Ramsey was born on 22 February 1903 in [[Cambridge]] where his father [[Arthur Stanley Ramsey]] (1867–1954), also a mathematician, was President of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]]. His mother was Mary Agnes Stanley (1875–1927). He was the eldest of two brothers and two sisters, and his brother [[Michael Ramsey]], the only one of the four siblings who was to remain Christian, later became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He entered [[Winchester College]] in 1915 and later returned to Cambridge to study mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. There he became a student of [[John Maynard Keynes]], and an active member in the Apostles. In 1923, he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics, passing his examinations with the result of [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class]] with distinction, and was named [[Senior Wrangler]] (top of his class).<ref>{{cite web|last= Ramsey|first=Frank P.|title=Frank P. Ramsey's Papers| url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead&cc=ascead&rgn=main&view=text&didno=US-PPiU-asp198301|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|access-date=19 September 2013 }}</ref> Easy-going, simple and modest, Ramsey had many interests besides his mathematical and scientific studies. Even as a teenager Ramsey exhibited both a profound ability and, as attested by his brother, an extremely diverse range of interests:

{{Quotation|He was interested in almost everything. He was immensely widely read in [[English literature]]; he was enjoying [[classics]] though he was on the verge of plunging into being a mathematical specialist; he was very interested in politics, and well-informed; he had got a political concern and a sort of left-wing caring-for-the-underdog kind of outlook about politics.|Michael Ramsey|Quoted in Mellor}}

In 1923, Ramsey was befriended by [[Geoffrey Pyke|Geoffrey]] and [[Margaret Pyke]], then on the point of founding the [[Malting House School]] in Cambridge; the Pykes took Ramsey into their family, taking him on holiday and asking him to be the godfather of their young son. Margaret found herself to be the object of his affection, Ramsey recording in his diary: 
<blockquote>
One afternoon I went out alone with her on [[Lake Orta]] and became filled with desire and we came back and lay on two beds side by side she reading, I pretending to, but with an awful conflict in my mind. After about an hour I said (she was wearing her horn spectacles and looking superlatively beautiful in the [[Edward Burne-Jones|Burne Jones]] style) ‘Margaret will you fuck with me?’<ref>Quoted from Ramsey's Diary, 13 January 1924 by Forrester, 2004</ref>
</blockquote>

Margaret wanted time to consider his proposition and thus began an uncomfortable dance between them, which contributed to Ramsey's depressive moods in early 1924; as a result, he travelled to Vienna for [[psychoanalysis]]. Like many of his contemporaries, including his Viennese flatmate and fellow Apostle [[Lionel Penrose]] (also in analysis with [[Siegfried Bernfeld]]), Ramsey was intellectually interested in psychoanalysis. Ramsey's analyst was [[Theodor Reik]], a disciple of [[Freud]]. As one of the justifications for undertaking the therapy, he asserted in a letter to his mother that unconscious impulses might affect even a mathematician's work. While in Vienna, he made a trip to [[Puchberg am Schneeberg|Puchberg]] in order to visit Wittgenstein, was befriended by the Wittgenstein family and visited [[A.S. Neill]]'s experimental school four hours from Vienna at Sonntagsberg. In the summer of 1924, he continued his analysis by joining Reik at Dobbiaco (in [[South Tyrol]]), where a fellow analysand was [[Lewis Namier]]. Ramsey returned to England in October 1924; with [[John Maynard Keynes]]'s support he became a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He joined a Psychoanalysis Group in Cambridge with fellow members [[Arthur Tansley]], [[Lionel Penrose]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], [[John Rickman (psychoanalist)|John Rickman]] and [[James Strachey]], the qualification for membership of which was a completed psychoanalysis.

Ramsey married Lettice Baker in September 1925, the wedding taking place in a Register Office since Ramsey was, as his wife described him, a ‘militant [[atheist]]'. The marriage produced two daughters. After Ramsey's death, [[Lettice Ramsey]] opened a photography studio in Cambridge with photographer [[Helen Muspratt]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.helenmuspratt-photographer.com/life/biography/|website=Helen Muspratt - Photographer|access-date=29 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718182823/http://www.helenmuspratt-photographer.com/life/biography|archive-date=18 July 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Despite his [[atheism]], Ramsey was "quite tolerant" towards his brother when the latter decided to become a priest in the [[Church of England]].<ref>"He was certainly sorry that I went on being religious; he was sorry that I decided to become a priest in the Church of England; sorry indeed, but quite tolerant." Quoted in Mellor, "Ramsey", p. 255</ref>

In 1926 he became a university lecturer in mathematics and later a Director of Studies in Mathematics at King's College.
The [[Vienna Circle]] manifesto (1929) lists three of his publications<ref>{{cite journal|author=Frank P. Ramsey|year=1925|title=Universals|url=http://www.hist-analytic.com/Ramseyonuniversals.htm|journal=Mind|volume=34|issue=136|pages=401–417|doi=10.1093/mind/xxxiv.136.401}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Frank P.

==Ramsey and Wittgenstein==

When [[I. A. Richards]] and [[C. K. Ogden]], both Fellows of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene]], first met Ramsey, he expressed his interest in learning German. According to Richards, he mastered the language "in almost hardly over a week",<ref>Quoted in Mellor, "Ramsey", p. 245,</ref> although other sources show he had taken one year of German in school.<ref>See Gabriele Taylor (in Galavotti 2006, 1–18) and Duarte (2009a)</ref> Ramsey was then able, at the age of 19, to make the first draft of the translation of the German text of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. Ramsey was impressed by Wittgenstein's work and after graduating as [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]] in the Mathematical [[Tripos]] of 1923 he made a journey to [[Austria]] to visit Wittgenstein, at that time teaching in a primary school in the small community of [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]]. For two weeks Ramsey discussed the difficulties he was facing in understanding the ''Tractatus''. Wittgenstein made some corrections to the English translation in Ramsey's copy and some annotations and changes to the German text that subsequently appeared in the second edition in 1933.

Ramsey and [[John Maynard Keynes]] cooperated to try to bring Wittgenstein back to Cambridge (he had been a student there before World War I). Once Wittgenstein had returned to Cambridge, Ramsey became his nominal supervisor.  Wittgenstein submitted the ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' as his doctoral thesis. [[G.E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] acted as examiners. Later, the three of them arranged financial aid for Wittgenstein to help him continue his research work.

In 1929 Ramsey and Wittgenstein regularly discussed issues in mathematics and philosophy with [[Piero Sraffa]], an [[Italians|Italian]] economist who had been brought to Cambridge by Keynes after Sraffa had aroused [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ire by publishing an article critical of the Fascist regime in the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''. The contributions of Ramsey to these conversations were acknowledged by both Sraffa and Wittgenstein in their later work, the latter mentioning him in the introduction to his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' as an influence.

==Early death==

Suffering from chronic [[liver]] problems, Ramsey developed [[jaundice]] after an abdominal operation and died on 19 January 1930 at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London at the age of 26. There is a suspicion that the cause of his death might be an undiagnosed [[leptospirosis]] with which Ramsey, an avid swimmer, could have become infected while swimming in the [[River Cam|Cam]].<ref>Cheryl Misak, "Frank Ramsey: A Genius By All Tests for Genius", https://hnn.us/article/174250</ref>

He is buried in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge; his parents are buried in the same plot.<ref>A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. [[Mark Goldie]], pages 62 and 63 (2009)</ref>

Ramsey's notes and manuscripts were acquired by [[Nicholas Rescher]] for the Archives of Scientific Philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Frank Plumpton|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21909907|title=On truth : original manuscript materials (1927-1929) from the Ramsey Collection at the University of Pittsburgh|date=1991|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|others=Nicholas Rescher, Ulrich Majer (Eds.)|isbn=0-7923-0857-3|location=Dordrecht|chapter=EDITORS' INTRODUCTION|oclc=21909907|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm%3A978-94-011-3738-6%2F1.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Frank Plumpton Ramsey Papers {{!}} Digital Pitt|url=https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collection/frank-plumpton-ramsey-papers|access-date=2021-04-30|website=digital.library.pitt.edu}}</ref> This collection contains only a few letters but a great many drafts of papers and book chapters, some still unpublished. Other papers, including his diary and letters and memoirs by his widow Lettice Ramsey and his father, are held in the Modern Archives, King's College, Cambridge.

==Work==

===Mathematical logic===
One of the [[theorem]]s proved by Ramsey in his 1928 paper ''On a Problem of Formal Logic'' now bears his name ([[Ramsey's theorem]]). While this theorem is the work Ramsey is probably best remembered for, he proved it only in passing, as a minor [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] along the way to his true goal in the paper, solving a special case of the [[Entscheidungsproblem|decision problem for first-order logic]], namely the [[decidability (logic)|decidability]] of what is now called the [[Bernays-Schonfinkel class|Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey class]] of [[first-order logic]], as well as a characterisation of the spectrum of sentences in this fragment of logic. [[Alonzo Church]] would go on to show that the general case of the decision problem for first-order logic is [[Unsolvable problem|unsolvable]] and that first-order logic is undecidable (see [[Church's theorem]]). A great amount of later work in mathematics was fruitfully developed out of the ostensibly minor lemma used by Ramsey in his decidability proof: this lemma turned out to be an important early result in [[combinatorics]], supporting the idea that within some sufficiently large systems, however disordered, there must be some order. So fruitful, in fact, was Ramsey's theorem that today there is an entire branch of mathematics, known as [[Ramsey theory]], which is dedicated to studying similar results.

In 1926,<ref>Ramsey, F.P. (1926). "The Foundations of Mathematics". ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', s2–25 (1), 338–384.</ref> Ramsey proposed a simplification of the [[Type theory|Theory of Types]] developed by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. The resulting theory is known today as [[History of type theory|Theory of Simple Type]] (TST) or Simple Type Theory. Ramsey observed that a hierarchy of types was sufficient to deal with mathematical [[paradox]]es, so removed Russell's and Whitehead's ramified hierarchy, which was meant to elude semantic paradoxes.<ref>Coquand, T. (2018). "Type Theory". ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2018 Edition), E. N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/></ref> Ramsey's version of the theory is the one considered by [[Kurt Gödel]] in the original proof of his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|First incompleteness theorem]].<ref>(1931). '"Über formal untentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I". ''Monatshefte fü Mathematik und Physik'', 38: 173–198</ref> Ramsey's Theory of Simple Types was further simplied by [[Willard van Orman Quine]] in his [[New Foundations]] [[set theory]], in which any explicit reference to types is eliminated from the language of the theory.<ref>Quine, W.V. (1937), "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic". ''American Mathematical Monthly'', 44: 70–80.</ref>

===Philosophy===
His main philosophical works included ''Universals'' (1925), ''Facts and propositions'' (1927) (which proposed a [[redundancy theory of truth]]), ''Universals of law and of fact'' (1928), ''Knowledge'' (1929), ''Theories'' (1929), ''On Truth'' (1929), ''Causal Qualities'' (1929), and ''General propositions and causality'' (1929). Ramsey was perhaps the first to propose a [[Reliabilism|reliablist]] theory of knowledge.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Goldman|first1=Alvin|title=Reliabilist Epistemology|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/reliabilism/|encyclopedia=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|quote=Perhaps the first formulation of a reliability account of knowing appeared in a brief discussion by [[iarchive:FoundationsEssaysInPhilosophyLogicMathematicsAndEconom/page/n131|F.P. Ramsey (1931)]], who said that a belief is knowledge if it is true, certain and obtained by a reliable process. This attracted no attention at the time and apparently did not influence reliability theories of the 1960s, 70s, or 80s.|access-date=2019-10-17|last2=Beddor|first2=Bob|author-link=Alvin Goldman}}</ref> He also produced, what philosopher Alan Hájek has described as an "enormously influential version of the subjective interpretation of probability."<ref>{{Citation|last=Hájek|first=Alan|title=Interpretations of Probability|date=2019|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2019/entries/probability-interpret/|encyclopedia=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2019|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> His thought in this area was outlined in the paper ''[[Frank P. Ramsey#Truth and Probability|Truth and Probability]]'' (discussed below) which was written in 1926 but first published posthumously in 1931.<ref name=":1" />

===Economics===

Keynes and Pigou encouraged Ramsey to work on economics as "From a very early age, about sixteen I think, his precocious mind was intensely interested in economic problems" (Keynes, 1933). Ramsey responded to Keynes's urging by writing three papers in economic theory all of which were of fundamental importance, though it was many years before they received their proper recognition by the community of economists.

Ramsey's three papers, described below in detail, were on [[subjective probability]] and [[utility]] (1926), [[optimal]] taxation (1927) and optimal growth with one-sector [[Ramsey growth model|economic growth]] (1928). The economist [[Paul Samuelson]] described them in 1970 as "three great legacies – legacies that were for the most part mere by-products of his major interest in the foundations of mathematics and knowledge."<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Paul A.|year=1970|title=What Makes for a Beautiful Problem in Science?|journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]]|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1372–1377|doi=10.1086/259716|jstor=1830631|s2cid=154344155}}</ref>

====''A Mathematical Theory of Saving''====

Described by [[Partha Dasgupta]], in a ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' entry devoted to it, as "one of the dozen or so most influential papers of the 20th century" in the field of academic economics, "A Mathematical Theory of Saving" was originally published in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' in 1928.<ref>{{Citation|last=Dasgupta|first=Partha|title=Ramsey and Intergenerational Welfare Economics|date=2019|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entries/ramsey-economics/|encyclopedia=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2019|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-10-17|author-link=Partha Dasgupta}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=F. P.|date=1928|title=A Mathematical Theory of Saving|url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Ramsey1928.pdf|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]|volume=38|issue=152|pages=543–559|doi=10.2307/2224098|issn=0013-0133|jstor=2224098}}</ref>  It employed, as [[Paul Samuelson]] described it, "a strategically beautiful application of the [[calculus of variations]]"<ref name=":0" /> to determine the optimal amount an economy should invest rather than consume so as to maximise future [[utility]], or as Ramsey put it, "how much of its income should a nation save?"<ref name=":2" />

Keynes described the article as "one of the most remarkable contributions to [[mathematical economics]] ever made, both in respect of the intrinsic importance and difficulty of its subject, the power and elegance of the technical methods employed, and the clear purity of illumination with which the writer's mind is felt by the reader to play about its subject. The article is terribly difficult reading for an economist, but it is not difficult to appreciate how scientific and aesthetic qualities are combined in it together."<ref>Keynes, J. M. (March 1930). "F. P. Ramsey".''[[The Economic Journal]]''. '''40''' (157): 153–154. [[JSTOR]]&nbsp;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2223657 2223657].reprinted in: Keynes J.M. (2010) "F. P. Ramsey", ''Essays in Biography''. Palgrave Macmillan, London, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-59074-2_29 p.335–336]</ref> The Ramsey model is today acknowledged as the starting point for [[Turnpike theory|optimal accumulation theory]] although its importance was not recognised until many years after its first publication.

The main contributions of the model were firstly the initial question Ramsey posed on how much savings should be and secondly the method of analysis, the intertemporal maximisation (optimisation) of collective or individual utility by applying techniques of dynamic optimisation. [[Tjalling C. Koopmans]] and [[David Cass]] modified the Ramsey model incorporating the dynamic features of [[population growth]] at a steady rate and of Harrod-neutral technical progress again at a steady rate, giving birth to a model named the [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model]] where the objective now is to maximise household's [[utility function]].

====''A Contribution to the Theory of Taxation''====

This paper, first published in 1927 has been described by [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] as "a landmark in the economics of public finance" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|author-link=Joseph E. Stiglitz|date=2015-03-01|title=In Praise of Frank Ramsey's Contribution to the Theory of Taxation|url=https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/sites/jstiglitz/files/In%20Praise%20of%20Frank%20Ramsey.pdf|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]|language=en|volume=125|issue=583|pages=235–268|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12187|s2cid=13147636|issn=0013-0133|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=F. P.|date=1927|title=A Contribution to the Theory of Taxation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]|volume=37|issue=145|pages=47–61|doi=10.2307/2222721|issn=0013-0133|jstor=2222721}}</ref> In the same, Ramsey contributed to [[economic theory]] the elegant concept of [[Ramsey pricing]]. This is applicable in situations where a (regulated) [[monopolist]] wants to maximise [[consumer surplus]] whilst at the same time ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over [[marginal cost]] is inversely proportional to the [[price elasticity]] of demand for that good. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved at the beginning of the article: "a given revenue is to be raised by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; how much should these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?"<ref name=":3" /> The problem was suggested to him by the economist [[Arthur Pigou]] and the paper was Ramsey's answer to the problem.

====''Truth and Probability''====
In ''[[A Treatise on Probability]]'' (1921), Keynes had argued against the subjective approach in [[epistemic]] probabilities. For Keynes, subjectivity of probabilities does not matter as much, as for him there is an objective relationship between knowledge and probabilities, as knowledge is disembodied and not personal.

Ramsey disagreed with this approach. In his article "Truth and Probability" (1926), he argued that there is a difference between the notions of [[probability]] in [[physics]] and in [[logic]].<ref name=":1">F.P. Ramsey (1926) "Truth and Probability", in Ramsey, 1931, ''[[iarchive:in.ernet.dli.2015.218361/page/n177|The Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays]]'', Ch. VII, p.156-198, edited by [[R. B. Braithwaite|R.B. Braithwaite]], London: Kegan, Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company '''[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7048428.pdf 1999 electronic edition]'''</ref> For Ramsey, probability is not related to a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of [[subjective probability]] and [[Bayesian probability]]. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' personal beliefs. Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what [[odds]] the individual would accept when [[betting]] on that outcome. After Ramsey's death, an approach to probability similar to his was developed independently by the Italian [[mathematician]] [[Bruno de Finetti]].<ref>de Finetti, B. (1937) "La Prevision: ses lois logiques, se sources subjectives". ''Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare'', 7: 1–68.</ref>
	
Ramsey suggested a way of deriving a consistent theory of choice under uncertainty that could isolate beliefs from preferences while still maintaining subjective probabilities.

Despite the fact that Ramsey's work on probabilities was of great importance, no one paid any attention to it until the publication of ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1944 (1947 2nd ed.).
