Johnson wrote numerous books, including three examinations of the consequences of what he called the "[[American imperialism|American Empire]]": ''Blowback'', ''The Sorrows of Empire'', and ''Nemesis; The Last Days of the American Republic''. A former [[Cold Warrior]], he notably stated, "A nation can be one or the other, a democracy or an imperialist, but it can't be both. If it sticks to imperialism, it will, like the old [[Roman Republic]], on which so much of our system was modeled, lose its democracy to a domestic dictatorship."<ref name="democracynow2007" />

==Career==
Johnson was born in 1931 in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], to David Frederick Johnson Jr. and Katherine Marjorie (Ashby) Johnson.<ref>Arizona State Board of Health, Phoenix, Maricopa Co., Arizona. #315-806-218</ref> He earned a BA in economics in 1953 and an MA and a PhD in [[political science]] in 1957 and 1961, respectively. Both of his advanced degrees were from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Johnson met his wife, Sheila, a junior at Berkeley, in 1956, and they married in [[Reno, Nevada]], in May 1957.<ref name=Sheila>Sheila K. Johnson (April 11, 2011) [http://original.antiwar.com/engelhardt/2011/04/10/chalmers-johnson-vs-the-empire/ Chalmers Johnson vs. the Empire], ''[[Antiwar.com]]''</ref>

During the [[Korean War]], Johnson served as a naval officer in Japan.<ref name="Blowback">{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Chalmers A|title=Blowback; The Costs and Consequences of American Empire|date=2004|publisher=Holt Paperbacks|isbn=0-8050-7559-3|edition=2nd}}</ref> He was a communications officer on the [[USS La Moure County (LST-883)|USS ''La Moure County'']], which ferried Chinese prisoners of war from [[South Korea]] back to ports in North Korea.<ref name=Sheila/> He taught political science at the University of California from 1962 until he retired from teaching in 1992. He was best known early in his career for his scholarship on the subjects of China and Japan.<ref>Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20101122x3.html Japan hand Chalmers Johnson dead at 79] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123001416/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20101122x3.html |date=November 23, 2010}}", ''[[Japan Times]]'', November 23, 2010, p. 2.</ref>

Johnson set the agenda for 10 or 15 years in social science scholarship on China, with his book on peasant nationalism. His book ''MITI and the Japanese Miracle'', on the Japanese [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]], was the pre-eminent study of the country's development and it created the subfield of what could be called the political economy of development. He coined the term "[[developmental state]]." As a public intellectual, he first led the "Japan revisionists" who critiqued American [[neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]] with Japan as a model, and their arguments faded from view as the Japanese economy stagnated in the mid-1990s and later. During that period, Johnson served as a consultant to the [[National Intelligence Estimate|Office of National Estimates]], part of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and contributed to analysis of China and [[Maoism]].<ref name="inmotionmagazine">{{cite web |year=2004|url = http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/global/cj_int/cj_int2.html|title = Interview with Chalmers Johnson Part 2. From CIA Analyst to Best-Selling Scholar|website= In Motion Magazine| access-date = April 4, 2009 | author=Nic Paget-Clarke}}</ref>

Johnson was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1976. He served as Director of the Center for Chinese Studies (1967–1972)<ref name="CCS"/> and Chair of the Political Science Department at Berkeley, and he held a number of important academic posts in area studies. He was a strong believer in the importance of [[language]] and historical training for conducting serious research. Late in his career, he became well known as a critic of [[rational choice]] approaches, particularly in the study of Japanese politics and political economy.

Johnson is probably best known as a sharp critic of American imperialism. His book ''Blowback'' (2000) won a prize in 2001 from the [[Before Columbus Foundation]], and it was reissued in an updated version in 2004. ''Sorrows of Empire'', published in 2004, updated the evidence and argument from ''Blowback'' for the post-[[9/11]] environment, and ''Nemesis'' concludes the trilogy. Johnson was featured as an expert [[Pundit|talking head]] in the [[Eugene Jarecki]]-directed film ''[[Why We Fight (2005 film)|Why We Fight]]'',<ref name="democracynow2007"/> which won the 2005 Grand Jury Prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

Johnson wrote for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', ''[[Harper's]]'', and ''[[The Nation]]''.

==Blowback series==
Johnson believed that the enforcement of [[American hegemony]] over the world constitutes a new form of global empire. Whereas traditional empires maintained control over subject peoples via colonies, the US, since World War II, has developed a vast system of hundreds of military bases around the world. A longtime [[Cold Warrior]], he applauded the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]: "I was a cold warrior. There's no doubt about that. I believed the Soviet Union was a genuine menace. I still think so."<ref name="antiwar">{{cite web |date=March 22, 2006|url = http://www.antiwar.com/engelhardt/?articleid=8739|title = Cold Warrior in a Strange Land|website= antiwar.com| access-date = April 4, 2009 | last=Engelhardt|first=Tom}}</ref> At the same time, however, he experienced a political awakening after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and noted that instead of demobilizing its armed forces, the US accelerated its reliance on military solutions to problems both economic and political. The result of that militarism, as distinct from domestic defense, is more terrorism against the US and its allies, the loss of core democratic values at home, and the eventual crumbling of the [[Economy of the United States|American economy]]. Of four books he wrote on the topic, the first three are referred to as the Blowback Trilogy. Johnson summarized the intent of the Blowback series in the final chapter of ''Nemesis''.

===''Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire''===
{{quote
|text=In ''Blowback'', I set out to explain why we are hated around the world. The concept "[[blowback (intelligence)|blowback]]" does not just mean retaliation for things our government has done to and in foreign countries. It refers to retaliation for the numerous illegal operations we have carried out abroad that were kept totally secret from the American public. This means that when the retaliation comes – as it did so spectacularly on September 11, 2001 – the American public is unable to put the events in context. So they tend to support acts intended to lash out against the perpetrators, thereby most commonly preparing the ground for yet another cycle of blowback. In the first book in this trilogy, I tried to provide some of the historical background for understanding the dilemmas we as a nation confront today, although I focused more on Asia – the area of my academic training – than on the Middle East.

===''The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic''===
{{quote
|text=''The Sorrows of Empire'' was written during the American preparations for and launching of the invasions and occupations of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. I began to study our continuous military buildup since World War II and the 737 military bases we currently maintain in other people's countries. This empire of bases is the concrete manifestation of our global [[hegemony]], and many of the blowback-inducing wars we have conducted had as their true purpose the sustaining and expanding of this network. We do not think of these overseas deployments as a form of empire; in fact, most Americans do not give them any thought at all until something truly shocking, such as the treatment of prisoners at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], brings them to our attention. But the people living next door to these bases and dealing with the swaggering soldiers who brawl and sometimes rape their women certainly think of them as imperial enclaves, just as the people of [[Iberian Peninsula#Roman rule|ancient Iberia]] or [[India#Early modern India|nineteenth-century India]] knew that they were victims of foreign colonization.

===''Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic''===
{{quote
|text=In ''Nemesis'', I have tried to present historical, political, economic, and philosophical evidence of where our current behavior is likely to lead. Specifically, I believe that to maintain our empire abroad requires resources and commitments that will inevitably undercut our domestic democracy and in the end produce a military dictatorship or its civilian equivalent. The founders of our nation understood this well and tried to create a form of government – a republic – that would prevent this from occurring.  But the combination of huge standing armies, almost continuous wars, [[military Keynesianism]], and ruinous military expenses have destroyed our republican structure in favor of an imperial presidency. We are on the cusp of losing our democracy for the sake of keeping our empire. Once a nation is started down that path, the dynamics that apply to all empires come into play – isolation, overstretch, the uniting of forces opposed to imperialism, and bankruptcy. [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] stalks our life as a free nation.

===''Dismantling the Empire: America's Last Best Hope''===
Johnson outlines how the United States can reverse American hegemony and preserve the American state. ''Dismantling the Empire'' is suggested reading for [[CIA]] personnel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peake|first1=Hayden B|title=Intelligence in Recent Public Literature The Intelligence Officer's Bookshelf|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol.-55-no.-1/the-intelligence-officers-bookshelf.html|website=Central Intelligence Agency|access-date=February 3, 2018}}</ref>

In 2010, Chalmers Johnson died after a long illness from complications of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] at his home, in [[Cardiff-by-the-Sea]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Renowned Asia scholar Chalmers Johnson dies at 79|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/22/AR2010112207005.html|work=The Washington Post|first=T.
