'''Kamer Daron Acemoğlu''' ({{IPA-tr|daˈɾon aˈdʒemoːɫu|lang}}; born September 3, 1967) is a Turkish-born American economist who has taught at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) since 1993. He is currently the [[James Rhyne Killian|Elizabeth and James Killian Professor]] of Economics at MIT. He was named [[List of Institute Professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Institute Professor]] in 2019.

Born to [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents in [[Istanbul]], Acemoglu completed his MSc and then PhD at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) at 25. He lectured at LSE for a year before joining the MIT. He was awarded the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] in 2005. Acemoglu is best known for his work on [[political economy]]. He has authored hundreds of papers, many of which are co-authored with his long-time collaborators [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]]. With Robinson, he authored ''Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'' (2006) and ''[[Why Nations Fail]]'' (2012). The latter, an influential book on the role that institutions play in shaping nations' economic outcomes, prompted wide scholarly and media commentary. Described as a [[centrist]], he believes in a regulated market economy. He regularly comments on political issues, economic inequality, and a variety of specific policies.

Acemoglu ranked third, behind [[Paul Krugman]] and [[Greg Mankiw]], in the list of "Favorite Living Economists Under Age 60" in a 2011 survey among American economists. In 2015, he was named the most cited economist of the past 10 years per [[Research Papers in Economics]] (RePEc) data. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Acemoglu is the third most frequently cited author on college syllabi for economics courses.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://opensyllabus.org/results-list/authors?size=50&fields=Economics |title = Open Syllabus Project}}</ref>

===Books===
====''Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy''====
Published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2006, ''Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'' by Acemoglu and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|Robinson]] analyzes the creation and consolidation of democratic societies. They argue that "democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentive to overthrow it. These processes depend on (1) the strength of civil society, (2) the structure of political institutions, (3) the nature of political and economic crises, (4) the level of economic inequality, (5) the structure of the economy, and (6) the form and extent of globalization."<ref>{{cite web|title=Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy|url=http://www.cambridge.org/am/academic/subjects/economics/public-economics-and-public-policy/economic-origins-dictatorship-and-democracy?format=HB&isbn=9780521855266#o9XJLbwV6hO1KmBV.97|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref>

[[Romain Wacziarg]] praised the book and argued that its substantive contribution is the theoretical fusion of the Marxist [[dialectical materialism]] ("institutional change results from distributional struggles between two distinct social groups, a rich ruling class and a poor majority, each of whose interests are shaped primarily by economic forces") and the ideas of [[Barry Weingast]] and [[Douglass North]], who argued that "institutional reform can be a way for the elite to credibly commit to future policies by delegating their enactment to interests that will not wish to reverse them."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wacziarg|first=Romain|author-link=Romain Wacziarg|title=Determinants of Democratization|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=15 September 2006|volume=313|issue=5793|pages=1576–1577|jstor=20031295|doi=10.1126/science.1131936|s2cid=154213515}}</ref> [[William Easterly]] called it "one of the most important contributions to the literature on the economics of democracy in a long time."

====''Why Nations Fail''====
[[File:"Why Nations Fail" by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson.jpg|thumb|120px|''Why Nations Fail'' was included in the Shortlist of the 2012 ''[[Financial Times]]'' [[Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award|Business Book of the Year Award]].]]

In their 2012 book, ''[[Why Nations Fail]]'', Acemoglu and Robinson argue that economic growth at the forefront of technology requires political stability, which the Mayan civilization (to name only one) did not have,<ref>e.g., p. 143</ref> and [[creative destruction]].  The latter cannot occur without institutional restraints on the granting of monopoly and oligopoly rights.  They say that the [[industrial revolution]] began in [[Great Britain]], because the English [[Bill of Rights 1689]] created such restraints.  For example, a steam boat built in 1705 by [[Denis Papin]] was demolished by a boatmen guild in Münden, Germany.  Papin went to London, where several of his papers were published by the Royal Society.  [[Thomas Newcomen]] extended Papin's work into a [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|steam engines]] in 1712, and became a commercial success, while Papin died in 1713 and was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave.<ref>esp. pp. 202-203.</ref>  

Acemoglu and Robinson insist that "development differences across countries are exclusively due to differences in political and economic institutions, and reject other theories that attribute some of the differences to culture, weather, geography or lack of knowledge about the best policies and practices."<ref name=Radelet>{{cite web|last1=Radelet|first1=Steven|author-link1=Steven Radelet|title=Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu and James A.

===Papers===
;Social programs and policies
In a 2001 article, Acemoglu argued that the minimum wage and [[unemployment benefits]] "shift the composition of employment toward high-wage jobs. Because the composition of jobs in the [[laissez-faire]] equilibrium is inefficiently biased toward low-wage jobs, these labor market regulations increase average labor productivity and may improve welfare."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|title=Good Jobs versus Bad Jobs|journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]]|date=January 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/209978|jstor=10.1086/209978|citeseerx=10.1.1.687.4806|s2cid=2316641}}</ref> Furthermore, he has argued that "minimum wages can increase training of affected workers, by inducing firms to train their unskilled employees."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Pischke|first2=Jörn-Steffen|title=Minimum Wages and On-the-job Training|journal=[[Research in Labor Economics]]|volume=22|pages=159–202|issn=0147-9121|doi=10.1016/S0147-9121(03)22005-7|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7623-1026-5|hdl=1721.1/63851|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w7184.pdf}}</ref>

Acemoglu ''et al.'' found that "democracy has a significant and robust positive effect on GDP" and suggest that "[[democratization]]s increase GDP per capita by about 20% in the long run."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Naidu|first2=Suresh|last3=Restrepo|first3=Pascual|last4=Robinson|first4=James A.|author-link4=James A.

;Social democracy and unions
Acemoglu and [[Philippe Aghion]] argued in 2001 that although deunionization in the US and UK since the 1980s is not the "underlying cause of the increase in inequality", it "amplifies the direct effect of skill-biased technical change by removing the wage compression imposed by unions."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Aghion|first2=Philippe|author-link2=Philippe Aghion|title=Deunionization, technical change and inequality|journal=[[Journal of Monetary Economics|Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy]]|date=2001|volume=55|pages=229–264|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/5691|doi=10.1016/s0167-2231(01)00058-6|s2cid=17495766}}</ref>

According to Acemoglu and Robinson, unions, historically had a significant role in creating democracy, especially in western Europe, and maintaining a balance between political power of established business interests and political elites.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|title=Economics versus Politics: Pitfalls of Policy Advice|journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]|date=2013|volume=27|issue=2|pages=173–192|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/10403|doi=10.1257/jep.27.2.173|hdl=1721.1/82599|hdl-access=free}}</ref> 

;Nordic model
In a 2012 paper titled "Can't We All Be More Like Scandinavians?", co-written with Robinson and Verdier, he suggests that "the more 'cutthroat' American society that makes possible the more 'cuddly' Scandinavian societies based on a comprehensive social safety net, the welfare state and more limited inequality." They concluded that "all countries may want to be like the 'Scandinavians' with a more extensive safety net and a more egalitarian structure," however, if the United States, the "cutthroat [capitalism] leader", the economic growth of the entire world would be reduced.<ref name="Like Scandinavians">{{cite journal|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|last3=Verdier|first3=Thierry|title=Can't We All Be More Like Scandinavians?

;Colonialism
"[[Colonial origins of comparative development|The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development]]", co-written by Acemoglu, Robinson, and [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] in 2001, is by far his most cited work.<ref name="scholar.google"/> Graham Mallard described it as "excellent example of his work: an influential paper that has led to much debate."<ref name="Mallard"/> They argue that Europeans set up extractive institutions in colonies where they did not settle, unlike in places where they did settle and that these institutions have persisted. They estimated that "differences in institutions explain approximately three-quarters of the [[income per capita]] differences across from former colonies."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|last3=Robinson|first3=James A.|author-link2=Simon Johnson (economist)|author-link3=James A.

They are also more deeply concerned about how powerful people fight to grab control of the state and otherwise compete to exert influence over the rest of society (a left-wing perspective)."<ref name="JohnsonNYTimes12"/> 

Acemoglu has praised the successes of the [[Progressive Era]], and argued in favor of its replication.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|author-link2=Simon Johnson (economist)|title=It's Time to Found a New Republic|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/15/its-time-to-found-a-new-republic/|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=15 August 2017}}</ref> Acemoglu argues that the [[market economy]] is the only system that creates prosperity. He believes in finding an appropriate balance between "incentivizing creativity, hard work and risk-taking and creating the essential [[public service]]s, [[social safety net]]s and [[Equal opportunity|equality of opportunity]]."<ref name="cnn soc"/> For Acemoglu, markets work only with regulations and [[Legal certainty|predictable laws]] and that all [[Regulated market|markets are regulated]] to some extent; it is only a matter of degree.<ref name="imf"/> He suggests that free markets are not unregulated markets.<ref name="hoover2009"/> 

;Wall Street
In September 2008, Acemoglu signed a petition condemning the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Bush administration's bailout]] plan of the U.S. financial system.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Christopher|title=Anti-bailout economists|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2008/09/antibailout_eco.html|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=24 September 2008}}</ref> As the main cause of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], he stated that policy makers were "lured by ideological notions derived from [[Ayn Rand]]’s novels rather than economic theory" and opined: "In hindsight, we should not be surprised that unregulated profit-seeking individuals have taken risks from which they benefit and others lose."<ref name="hoover2009"/> In an early analysis of the [[Great Recession]], Acemoglu wrote: "When channeled into [[Profit maximization|profit-maximizing]], competitive, and innovative behavior under the auspices of sound laws and regulations, greed can act as the engine of innovation and economic growth. But when unchecked by the appropriate institutions and regulations, it will degenerate into [[rent-seeking]], corruption, and crime."<ref name="imf"/> He argues that the heavy overrepresentation from the financial sector in the top 1% "has been an outcome of the political processes that have removed all of the regulations in finance, and so created the platform for 40 percent of U.S. corporate profits to be in the financial sector."<ref name="Clement"/> He argues that a platform, particularly in Wall Street, has been created "where the ambition and greed of people, often men, has been channeled in a very anti-social, selfish and socially destructive direction."<ref name="fivebooks" />

;Inequality
Acemoglu has voiced concerns regarding the increasing inequality in the US, which in his view turns into political inequality, in turn undermining the inclusiveness of US institutions.<ref name="Friedman"/> In 2012 he identified societal polarization, caused by economic inequality, as the biggest problem for the US.<ref name="Korones"/> He argues that "democracy ceases to function because some people have so much money they command greater power."<ref name="Keller"/> He states that he is comfortable with economic inequality which comes through different social contributions as it is a "price that we pay for providing incentives for people to contribute to prosperity." However, high levels of inequality create problems as the rich who control significant portions of the societal resources use them to create an "unequal distribution of political power."<ref name="fivebooks"/> He sees the solution in increasing [[social mobility]] by "providing an opportunity for the bottom to become rich, not forcing the rich to become poor."<ref name="Keller"/>

Acemoglu has praised the American tradition of vibrant protest movements dating back to the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] and the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressives]].<ref name="fpTrump"/> He has also praised [[Occupy Wall Street]] for "putting the question of inequality on the agenda, but also for actually standing up for political equality."<ref name="hp2012"/> He notes that Occupy Wall Street brought the 1% to the attention of the wider public, academic attention was brought by [[Tony Atkinson]], [[Thomas Piketty]], and [[Emmanuel Saez]].<ref name="fivebooks"/>

;Specific policies
Acemoglu is in favor of raising and indexing the [[minimum wage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Over 600 Economists Sign Letter In Support of $10.10 Minimum Wage|url=http://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-statement/|publisher=[[Economic Policy Institute]]|date=14 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009121909/http://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-statement/|archive-date=9 October 2017}}</ref>

He instead advocates for a "guaranteed-income program would offer transfers only to individuals whose monthly income is below $1,000, thereby coming in at a mere fraction of a UBI’s cost."

;Socialism, communism, and Marxism
Acemoglu argues that [[socialist states]] have not been successful in creating prosperity.<ref name="cnn soc">{{cite news|title=Is democratic socialism the right path for America?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/27/opinions/opinion-roundup-socialism/index.html|agency=[[CNN]]|date=28 October 2015}} ([https://archive.org/details/IsBernieSandersDemocraticSocialismRightForAmericaOpinionCNN archived])</ref> He wrote that socialist regimes "from Cuba to the eastern bloc have been disastrous both for economic prosperity and individual freedom."<ref name="socdem"/>  

In a review written with [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]], he argues that [[Thomas Piketty]] and [[Karl Marx]] are "led astray" due to their disregard for "the key forces shaping how an economy functions: the endogenous evolution of technology and of the institutions and the political equilibrium that influence not only technology but also how markets function and how the gains from various different economic arrangements are distributed."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism|journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]|date=2015|volume=29|issue=1|pages=3–28|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/11348|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213070624/http://economics.mit.edu/files/11348|archive-date=2017-02-13|doi=10.1257/jep.29.1.3|citeseerx=10.1.1.687.2487|hdl=1721.1/113636|s2cid=14001669}}</ref>

;Social democracy and unions
In 2019, Acemoglu argued in favor of [[social democracy]]. He stated: "[Social democracy, when practiced by competent governments] is a phenomenal success. Everywhere in the west is to some degree social democratic, but the extent of this varies. We owe our prosperity and freedom to social democracy. ... [Social democracy] did not achieve these things by taxing and redistributing a lot. It achieved them by having labor institutions protecting workers, encouraging job creation and encouraging high wages."<ref name="socdem"/> Acemoglu also noted that the economists of US presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]], who is an advocate of democratic socialism along the lines of social democratic [[Nordic model]], "don't understand basic economics. They are not just dangerous, they are clueless."<ref name="socdem"/>

Acemoglu argued that a "tradition of strong labor movement or social democratic party, by constraining the actions of the social planner, can act as a commitment device to egalitarianism, inducing an equilibrium in which the country in question becomes the beneficiary from the asymmetric world equilibrium."<ref name="Like Scandinavians"/>

;Donald Trump
In an op-ed in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', Acemoglu claimed that President [[Donald Trump]] shared political goals and strategies of [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Vladimir Putin]], and [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], such as "little respect for the rule of law or the independence of state institutions, ... a blurred vision of national and personal interests, ... little patience with criticism and a long-established strategy of rewarding loyalty, which can be seen in his high-level appointments to date. This is all topped by an unwavering belief in his abilities."<ref name="fpTrump"/> In a 2019 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Acemoglu stated that he sees similarities between Trump and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the Nazis: "Surely, Trump and the Republicans are no Nazis. But they are exploiting the same political sentiment." He argues that Trump "poses a great risk to U.S. democracy" because he is "looking for a new order with elements of anti-liberalism, misinformation and a lax attitude to corruption. If he is re-elected next year, it will be the beginning of the end of American democracy."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sauga |first1=Michael |title=Political Economist Daran Acemoglu: 'Trump Poses a Great Risk to U.S. Democracy' |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/economist-acemoglu-trump-poses-risk-to-u-s-democracy-a-1300376-amp.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=12 October 2019}}</ref>

;Authoritarian countries
According to Acemoglu, the three obstacles for economic growth under authoritarian regimes are the tendency of authoritarian regimes to become more authoritarian, their tendency to use power to halt "[[Schumpeter]]ian [[creative destruction]], which is key to sustaining growth" and the instability and uncertainty caused by internal conflicts.<ref name="imf"/> He believes that Saudi Arabia would be like a poor African country without the oil, while the "only thing that is keeping [Russia] going is a big boom in natural resources and a clever handling of the media."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Freeland|first1=Chrystia|author-link1=Chrystia Freeland|title=Dignity and the Wealth of Nations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/world/europe/02iht-letter02.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 March 2012}}</ref>

He believes that China has managed to achieve significant economic growth because it "sort of picked up the low hanging fruit from the world technology frontier, but that sort of growth is not going to last until China goes to the next step, which is harnessing innovation," which he argues will be impossible "unless economic institutions become even more open and the extractive political institutions in China will be a barrier to that."<ref name="Korones"/> He and Robinson wrote for the ''[[HuffPost]]'' that the "limited rights [China] affords its citizens places major restrictions on the country’s longer-term possibilities for prosperity."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|title=Will China Rule the World?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daron-acemoglu/china-superpower_b_1369424.html|website=[[HuffPost]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106193656/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daron-acemoglu/china-superpower_b_1369424.html|archive-date=6 November 2017|date=2012-03-21}}</ref>

Acemoglu opined that the Republic of Turkey, formed in 1923 by [[Atatürk]], "is very continuous with the Ottoman Empire."

In an op-ed for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' following the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], Acemoglu advocated Ukraine "to break with its past as quickly as possible. It needs to move away from Russia, politically and economically, even if that means an end to the natural-gas subsidies Russia has used to keep it in the position of a client state. Even more important is for Ukraine’s leaders to spread political power and economic benefits to the maximum number of its people, including Russian speakers."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|title=Ukraine's legacy of serial oligopoly|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/ukrainians-need-inclusion-not-extraction/article17481308/?arc404=true|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=14 March 2014}}</ref>

Acemoglu argued that the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] was caused by the "terrible state of Greek institutions, and the [[Clientelism|clientelistic]] nature of its politics", and stated that the country's problems are "political not just macroeconomic."
