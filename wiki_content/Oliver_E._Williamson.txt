==Life and career==
Williamson was born in [[Superior, Wisconsin]], on 27 September 1932.<ref name=":0" /> He was the son of Sara Lucille (Dunn) and Scott Williamson, both of whom were high school teachers.<ref name=":0" /> 

Williamson attended [[Superior High School (Wisconsin)|Central High School]] in Superior.<ref>{{cite web | title = Five Individuals, 1952 Cathedral Football Team Among 2010 HOF Inductees | publisher = Superior Telegram | date =  February 11, 2010 | url = http://www.superiortelegram.com/content/five-indviduals-1952-cathedral-football-team-among-2010-hof-inductees}}</ref>  He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in management from the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 1955. After graduating, he worked as a project engineer for General Electric, as well as the Central Intelligence Agency.<ref name=":0" />

He received an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1960, and his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1963. A student of [[Ronald Coase]], [[Herbert A. Simon]] and [[Richard Cyert]], he specialized in [[transaction cost]] economics.  

From 1963 to 1965 he was an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.  From 1965 to 1983 he was a professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and from 1983 to 1988, Gordon B. Tweedy Professor of [[Law and economics|Economics of Law]] and Organization at [[Yale University]]. While at Yale, Williamson was a founder of ''[[The Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization]]''. He held professorships in business administration, economics, and law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] since 1988 and was the [[Edgar Kaiser Sr.|Edgar F. Kaiser]] Professor Emeritus at the [[Haas School of Business]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae of Oliver E.

==Theory==
By drawing attention at a high theoretical level to equivalences and differences between market and non-market decision-making, management and service provision, Williamson was influential in the 1980s and 1990s debates on the boundaries between the public and private sectors.

His focus on the costs of transactions led Williamson to distinguish between repeated case-by-case bargaining on the one hand and relationship-specific contracts on the other. For example, the repeated purchasing of coal from a [[spot market]] to meet the daily or weekly needs of an [[electric power|electric utility]] would represent case-by-case bargaining. But over time, the utility is likely to form ongoing relationships with a specific supplier, and the economics of the relationship-specific dealings will be importantly different, he argued.

Other economists have tested Williamson's transaction-cost theories in empirical contexts. One important example is a paper by [[Paul Joskow|Paul L. Joskow]], "[[Contract]] Duration and Relationship-Specific Investments: Empirical Evidence from [[Coal]] [[Market (economics)|Market]]s", in ''[[American Economic Review]]'', March 1987. The [[Contract theory#Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracts]] approach to the [[theory of the firm]] and [[corporate finance]] is partly based on the work of Williamson and Coase.<ref>[[Oliver Hart (economist)|Hart, Oliver]], (1995), ''Firms, Contracts, and Financial Structure''. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-828881-6}}.</ref>

Williamson was credited with the development of the term "information impactedness", which applies in situations in which it is difficult to ascertain the costs to information. As he explained in ''Markets and Hierarchies'', it exists "mainly because of uncertainty and [[economic opportunism|opportunism]], though [[bounded rationality]] is involved as well. It exists when true underlying circumstances relevant to the transaction, or related set of transactions, are known to one or more parties but cannot be costlessly discerned by or displayed for others". Thus, Williamson is to be counted among those who have taken issue with the view that the firm is another type of market, characterized by a nexus of contracts. In his own words: "But to regard the corporation only as a nexus of contracts misses much of what is truly distinctive about this mode of governance…"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Oliver E.|date=1991|title=Comparative Economic Organization: The Analysis of Discrete Structural Alternatives|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393356|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=269–296|doi=10.2307/2393356|issn=0001-8392}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Agafonow|first=Alejandro|title=Discoveries in the Science of Organizational Economics|date=2020|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48352-8_43-2|work=Handbook of Philosophy of Management|pages=1–21|editor-last=Neesham|editor-first=Cristina|series=Handbooks in Philosophy|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-48352-8_43-2|isbn=978-3-319-48352-8|access-date=2021-10-27|last2=Perez|first2=Marybel}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] cited Williamson and [[Elinor Ostrom]] to share the 10-million [[Swedish kronor]] (£910,000; $1.44 million) prize "for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm".<ref name="Nobelprize">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-10-11}} </ref> Williamson, in the BBC's paraphrase of the academy's reasoning, "developed a theory where business firms served as structures for conflict resolution".<ref>Special Issue of ''Journal of Retailing'' in Honor of The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2009 to Oliver E.
