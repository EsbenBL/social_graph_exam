'''Oscar Lewis''', born '''Lefkowitz''' (December 25, 1914 – December 16, 1970)<ref name=NNDB>{{cite web|title=Oscar Lewis|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/351/000117997/|work=NNDB|publisher=Soylent Communications|access-date=22 May 2013}}</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropologist]]. He is best known for his vivid depictions of the lives of [[slum]] dwellers and his argument that a cross-generational [[culture of poverty]] transcends national boundaries. Lewis contended that the cultural similarities occurred because they were "common adaptations to common problems" and that "the culture of poverty is both an adaptation and a reaction of the poor classes to their marginal position in a class-stratified, highly individualistic, capitalistic society."<ref name="nytimes">Whitman, Alden.
