'''John Wilfred Meyer''' (born 1935) is a [[sociologist]] and emeritus professor at [[Stanford University]].<ref>Stanford University (2016) 'John Meyer | Department of Sociology'. https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/john-meyer</ref>  Beginning in the 1970s and continuing to the present day, Meyer has contributed fundamental ideas to the field of sociology, especially in the areas of education, organizations, and global and transnational sociology.  He is best known for the development of the neo-institutional perspective on globalization, known as world society or [[World Polity Theory]].<ref>Stanford University (2009) [http://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/news/cddrl_faculty_team_receives_grant_to_study_globalization_citizenship_and_education_20091123 FSI | CDDRL - CDDRL faculty team receives grant to study globalization, citizenship, and education].</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wimmer|first=Andreas|date=2021-05-01|title=Domains of Diffusion: How Culture and Institutions Travel around the World and with What Consequences|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/714273|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=126|issue=6|pages=1389–1438|doi=10.1086/714273|issn=0002-9602|archive-url=http://www.columbia.edu/~aw2951/DomainsPrintedFinal.pdf|archive-date=2021}}</ref> In 2015, he became the recipient of American Sociological Association's highest honor - [[W.E.B. Du Bois Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award]].

==Education and career==
Meyer received his B.A. in Psychology from [[Goshen College]], located in [[Goshen, Indiana]] in 1955; his M.A. in Sociology from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] in 1957; and his Ph.D. in Sociology from [[Columbia University]] in 1965.  Since 1966, he has been a professor at Stanford University (emeritus since 2001).

==Research==
Most mainstream sociological perspectives are realist in orientation, building explanations around concrete actors and particular interests.  By contrast, the Meyerian perspective is phenomenologically oriented.  It stresses the dependence of local social organization on institutionalized models and definitions, promulgated by professionals and associations to promote collective goods.  The dependence involved is more than causal influence.  In the Meyerian view, institutional environments ''constitute'' local structures – establishing and defining their core entities, purposes, and interrelationships.  Enacted models thus are often decoupled from local circumstances.<ref>Stanford University (2016) 'FSI - John Meyer'. http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/John_Meyer</ref>

Meyer initially developed the general perspective in the context of schooling.  Departing from conventional views, Meyer envisioned schools as embodiments of collective myth and ceremonial administration, deeply bound to Modern narratives of progress and justice.  His framework, developed with Francisco O. Ramirez and others, reveals the profound extent to which local school arrangements depend on broader social institutions to supply their form and function.

He next applied his ideas to the field of organizations.  He helped pioneer the sociological [[new institutionalism]],<ref>1977. "Institutionalized Organizations: Formal Structure as Myth and Ceremony" (with Brian Rowan).  ''American Journal of Sociology'' 83: 340-63</ref> stressing the role of [[loose coupling]] in organizational behavior and the conditions under which the diffusion of practices takes place (e.g. ''Organizational Environments'', with W. Richard Scott, Sage 1983).  A primary contention is that formal organizations incorporate institutionalized practices and procedures in order to maintain legitimacy.  Organizations that align with the myths supplied by their institutional environments increase their survival prospects, even when doing so costs them internal coherence.

The third area in which Meyer's work has had broad influence, and the area in which his ideas may finally have their most durable impact, is in the analysis of world society.  In 1980, he coined the term "[[World Polity Theory|world polity]]" to describe the stateless character of the international system and distinguish a civil society approach to globalization from existing [[world-systems analysis]].<ref>1980. "The World Polity and the Authority of the Nation-State."  In A. Bergesen (ed.), ''Studies of the Modern World-System.''  Academic Press: 109-37.</ref>  Meyer and coauthors John Boli, Francisco O. Ramirez, and George M. Thomas applied insights from his analyses of organizations to the global level, showing that even nation-states are constituted, shaped, and restructured by forces operating in their enveloping institutional environments.<ref>1997. "World Society and the Nation-State" (with John Boli, George M. Thomas, and Francisco O. Ramirez).  ''American Journal of Sociology'' 103: 144-81.</ref>  This line of work uniquely accounts for several peculiar features of global change that other perspectives fail to notice:  structural isomorphism; rapid, worldwide change in the nature and purposes of states in regard to environmentalism, the status of women, etc.; the decoupling of national development plans and programs from specific local conditions; and so on.  The development of this theoretical paradigm has motivated much of Meyer's later work.  Accordingly, Meyer's earlier interests in schooling and organizations were subsequently explored in the context of world society, e.g. the influences of modern world practices on educational systems and their expansion over time.<ref>Stanford University (2016) 'John W. Meyer'. https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/instructor/meyer</ref>

Over the course of his career, Meyer has authored or co-authored more than 200 scholarly articles and books.<ref>Stanford Comparative Sociology Workshop (2003) 'papers'. https://web.stanford.edu/group/csw/papers.html</ref>  In 2009, [[Georg Krücken]] and Gili S. Drori edited a retrospective of Meyer's work entitled ''World Society: The Writings of John W. Meyer''.  Currently, he is studying the impact of the human rights regime worldwide, and the impact of global society on national states and societies.
