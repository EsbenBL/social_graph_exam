{{Political campaigning}}

'''Political consulting''' is a form of [[consulting]] that consists primarily of advising and assisting [[political campaigns]]. Although the most important role of political consultants is arguably the development and production of [[mass media]] (largely [[television]] and [[Advertising mail|direct mail]]), consultants advise campaigns on many other activities, ranging from [[opposition research]] and [[Polling place|voter polling]], to field [[strategy]] and [[get out the vote]] efforts.

==Origins==
President [[William McKinley]]'s closest political adviser [[Mark Hanna]] is sometimes described as the first political [[consultant]].

[[Whitaker and Baxter]] established the first true political consulting firm, '''Campaigns, Inc.''',<ref>{{Cite web|title = How Politics Became a Business|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/24/the-lie-factory|website = The New Yorker|access-date = 2015-12-18}}</ref> which focused exclusively on [[political campaign]]s in [[California]] in the 1930s - 1950s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_yr2011_chunk_g978140513199521_ss54-1|title=Political Consultant|publisher=International Encyclopedia of Communication|access-date=2012-11-07}}</ref> However, political consulting blossomed with the increasing use of [[television advertising]] for '''campaign communications'''<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Virtuous Circle: Political Communications in Post-Industrial Societies|last = Norris|first = Pipa Norris|pages = 1, 2, 3}}</ref> in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_yr2011_chunk_g978140513199521_ss54-1|title=Political Consultant|publisher=International Encyclopedia of Communication|access-date=2012-11-07}}</ref>

[[Joseph Napolitan]] was the first person to describe himself as a political [[consultant]];<ref>{{Cite book|title = Manship Guide to Political Communication|last = Perlmutter|first = David|pages = 19}}</ref> [[The New York Times]] newspaper described him in a 1968 profile as ''"that newest American phenomenon, the professional campaign manager"'' and ''a "pioneering campaign [[consultant]]"''.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Joseph Napolitan, Pioneering Campaign Consultant, Dies at 84|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/us/joseph-napolitan-pioneering-campaign-consultant-dies-at-84.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-12-09|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Paul|last = Vitello}}</ref>

In recent years, political consulting has become more commonplace throughout the world and has extended its reach to campaigns at all levels of government. Many consultants work not only for campaigns, but also for [[political party|parties]] and [[political action committee]]s, while some focus on [[public relations]] and research work. Many consultants also take up official positions inside Governments while working for a ruling party candidate.

==Nature of the work==
Political consultants sometimes act as political strategists,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.collegefortn.org/Career_Planning/Career_Profile/Career_Profile.aspx?id=brKDga9mCotJfFOGYghoowXAP3DPAXXAP3DPAX|title= Political Strategist|publisher=Tennessee.Gov |access-date=2012-11-07}}</ref> a senior political consultant who promote the [[election]] of certain [[candidate]]s or the interests of certain groups. This is achieved by planning campaign [[Strategy|strategies]], coordinating campaign staffers, and arranging events to publicize candidates or causes.

Political consultants act as [[public relations]] specialists, salespeople and managers. By using many forms of [[marketing]]-suitable media, including [[advertising]] and [[press release]]s, the general goal of political [[consultant]]s is to make voters aware of their candidates' [[party platform]].

As political consulting has expanded worldwide, [[journalist]]s have noted the influence of political consulting on candidates, voters, presidents and governments of different nations.<ref>{{Cite news|title = A Brazilian Campaign Strategist Expands His Winning Streak|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/world/americas/a-brazilian-campaign-strategist-expands-his-winning-streak.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-04-05|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Simon|last = Romero}}</ref> Well-known [[American Association of Political Consultants|American political consultants]] such as [[James Carville]], [[Joseph Napolitan]] and David H.

== Criticisms ==
===Scandals===
As political consulting has become more prevalent, consultants have become subject to increasing scrutiny and involvement in [[Spotlight Scandals|spotlight scandals]] as [[journalism|journalists]] have devoted considerable attention to their activities. Some successful political consultants, such as [[James Carville]] and [[Newt Gingrich]], capitalize on their consulting fame to become professional [[pundit (politics)|pundits]]. Such political consultants routinely appear on [[television]] [[news program]]s, write books and are treated as social media [[celebrity|celebrities.]]<ref>{{Cite news|title = Political Consultants and Strategists - Presidential Election of 2008 - John McCain - Terry Nelson|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/weekinreview/15nagourney.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2007-07-15|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Adam|last = Nagourney}}</ref>

Some detractors accuse political consultants of putting their own interests and images ahead of their clients. Some consultants allege that too many consultants put their own financial interests ahead of the campaigns they are hired to serve, take on too many clients, or focus too much energy on building their own reputations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = South Carolina's dirty political reputation outlives reality - CNNPolitics.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/11/politics/sc-dirty-politics/index.html|website = CNN|access-date = 2015-12-18}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Critics of the political consulting industry blame consultants for what they see as problems in the American election system.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Poison Politics: Are Negative Campaigns Destroying Democracy?|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ORIXBQAAQBAJ|publisher = Basic Books|date = 2003-02-22|isbn = 0738208728|first = Victor|last = Kamber}}</ref>

===Social media in modern campaigns===
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Political Campaigns and Social Media — Tweeting Their Way Into Office|url = http://source.southuniversity.edu/political-campaigns-and-social-media-tweeting-their-way-into-office-106986.aspx|website = source.southuniversity.edu|access-date = 2015-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Rand Paul Ready To Run As His Own Meme|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/07/rand-paul-campaign_n_7013804.html|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2015-12-18}}</ref> With younger and more tech-savvy citizens entering into the voting population, social media are the platforms on which the [[politician]]s need to establish themselves and engage with the public. In years to come, social media is anticipated to overtake traditional media in terms of importance to political campaigns.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Social Media is Changing the Nature of Political Campaigns|url = http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-media-is-changing-the-nature-of-political-campaigns/619572|website = www.adweek.com|access-date = 2015-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = 5 Ways New Media Are Changing Politics|url = https://www.usnews.com/opinion/slideshows/5-ways-new-media-are-changing-politics|website = US News & World Report|date = 2010-02-03|access-date = 2015-12-18}}</ref> 

For example, in [[Australia]] 86% of Australians access the [[Internet]], and with a 17,048,864 voting age population (according to IDEA),<ref>{{Cite web|title = Voter turnout data for Australia (Parliamentary) {{!}} Voter Turnout {{!}} International IDEA|url = http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU|website = www.idea.int|access-date = 2015-12-18|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306175234/http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?countrycode=au|archive-date = 2016-03-06|url-status = dead}}</ref> around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use [[social media]], which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net/#!political-campaign-and-social/cjsl|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|access-date=2014-01-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/#!political-campaign-and-social/cjsl|archive-date=2014-01-16}}</ref>

The implication of this for political consulting is that social media are the channels through which an increasingly larger portion of the population receives political messages. As a consequence, unless a political consultant addresses the part of the electorate which can preferentially be reached through social media, the portion of the electorate which will be reached through traditional communication technologies will increasingly shrink in the future.

== Trade organizations ==
The [[American Association of Political Consultants]] is the major trade association for political consultants in the [[United States]], with thousands of members. Like other professional organizations,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-04-04|title=Big Effort Aims To Elect Candidates With Science Backgrounds|url=https://www.wbez.org/stories/big-effort-aims-to-elect-candidates-with-science-backgrounds/93c7fcc8-4a74-4f00-b452-a46362a2eff2|access-date=2021-04-05|website=WBEZ Chicago|language=en}}</ref> it propagates a code of ethics and gives out [[award]]s. Similar organizations for political consultants exist for many other countries and regions.
