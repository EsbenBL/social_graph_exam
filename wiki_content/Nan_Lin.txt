==Research==

Lin's research interest lies in [[social network]]s, [[social support]] and [[social capital]]. He has contributed theory, devised measurements and conducted empirical research in each of these areas. He has applied the theory and measurements to the study of [[social stratification]] and [[Social mobility|mobility]], [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[coping (psychology)|coping]], and individual, organization and community [[well-being]].

Lin has employed both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] methods—such as large-scale national surveys, and surveys in organizations and communities—and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods, such as intensive long-term observations in villages, for example.

Having written about [[social network]]s since the early 1980s,<ref name=midgley /> Lin contributed to the economically-oriented branch of the literature on [[social capital]] defined by [[Mark Granovetter]] and [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]],<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Yale University Press| isbn = 0-300-11056-1| last = Benkler| first = Yochai| title = The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom| location = New Haven and London| date = 2006-05-16| page = [https://archive.org/details/wealthofnetworks00benk/page/95 95]| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/wealthofnetworks00benk/page/95}}</ref> seeking to establish a research paradigm which integrates theory with empirical testing. His definition of social capital as access to resources through network ties is one of the most widely accepted conceptualizations of the term.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/0190272510369079| volume = 73| issue = 2| pages = 119–131 [126]| last = Molm| first = Linda D.| title = The Structure of Reciprocity| journal = Social Psychology Quarterly| date = 2010-06-01| s2cid = 145162105}}</ref> This definition of social capital is quantifiable and widely held to be more precise than the one popularized by [[Robert D. Putnam|Robert Putnam]].<ref name="williams">{{Cite journal| volume = 4| issue = 3| last = Williams| first = Kate|author2=Joan C. Durrance | title = Social Networks and Social Capital: Rethinking Theory in Community Informatics| journal = The Journal of Community Informatics| accessdate = 2011-04-30| year = 2008| url = http://www.ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej/article/view/465/430}}</ref> Lin also rejects Putnam's thesis, put forward in [[Bowling Alone]], that social capital is decreasing; he maintains that it is, in fact, on the ascent thanks to increasingly pervasive online networking.<ref name="williams" />
