He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in economics and Russian at the [[Vancouver School of Economics]] of the [[University of British Columbia]], and went on a scholarship to the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle.<ref name=":2" /> He went on to complete his [[PhD]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] while continuing to study at the [[London School of Economics]].<ref name=":2" />

In 2006 Mundell earned an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Waterloo]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402153241/https://lists.uwaterloo.ca/pipermail/uw-news-release/2006-April/000596.html]</ref> He was Professor of Economics and Editor of the [[Journal of Political Economy]] at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1965 to 1972, Chairman of the Department of Economics at the [[University of Waterloo]] 1972 to 1974 and since 1974 he had been Professor of Economics at [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polyu.edu.hk/iao/nobel2009/mundell_bio.pdf|title=Biography of Robert Mundell|website=The Hong Kong Polytechnic University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402074623/http://www.polyu.edu.hk/iao/nobel2009/mundell_bio.pdf|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=2012-07-06|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He also held the post of Repap Professor of Economics at [[McGill University]].<ref name="Nobelprize" /><ref name="Robertmundell.net">{{cite web|url=http://robertmundell.net/biography/ |title=Biography &#124; The Works of Robert Mundell |publisher=Robertmundell.net |access-date=January 1, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
From 1974 until his death he had been a professor in the Economics department at Columbia University; and from 2001 he had held Columbia's highest academic rank – [[University Professor]]. After completing his post-doctoral fellowship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1957, he began teaching economics at [[Stanford University]], and then [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] during 1959–1961.<ref name="webapps" /> In 1961, he went on to staff the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Mundell returned to academics as professor of economics at the University of Chicago from 1966 to 1971, and then served as professor during summers at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]] until 1975. In 1989, he was appointed to the post of Repap Professor of Economics at [[McGill University]].<ref name="Nobelprize"/><ref name="Robertmundell.net"/>  In the 1970s, he laid the groundwork for the introduction of the [[euro]] through his pioneering work in monetary dynamics and optimum currency forms for which he won the 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics. During this time he continued to serve as an economic adviser to the [[United Nations]], the IMF, the [[World Bank]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Federal Reserve Board]], the [[United States Department of Treasury]] and the governments of Canada and other countries. He was the Distinguished Professor-at-Large of [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]]. His 1971 Princeton tract ''The dollar and the policy mix'' is credited with founding [[supply-side economics]] (Bartlett 1971, p 101).

Among his major contributions are:
* Theoretical work on [[optimum currency area]]s<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Robert Mundell and the Theoretical Foundation for the European Monetary Union|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/54/vc121399|access-date=2021-04-06|website=IMF|language=en}}</ref>

==International monetary flows==
Mundell is best known in politics for his support of [[tax cut]]s and [[supply-side economics]]; however, in economics it is for his work on currency areas<ref>[http://www.policonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/A-Theory-of-Optimum-Currency-Areas.pdf A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; The American Economic Review, Vol. 51, No. 4, pp. 657–665, 1961</ref> and international [[exchange rate]]s<ref>[http://www.policonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/Capital-Mobility-and-Stabilization-Policy-under-Fixed-and-Flexible-Exchange-Rates.pdf Capital Mobility, and Stabilization Policy under Fixed and Flexible Exchange Rates]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; Revue Canadienne d'Economique et de Science Politique, Vol. 29, No. 4, pp. 475–485, 1963</ref> that he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] by the Bank of Sweden ([[Sveriges Riksbank]]). Nevertheless, supply-side economics featured prominently in his Bank of Sweden prize speech.

In the 1960s, Mundell's native Canada floated its exchange rate: this caused Mundell to begin investigating the results of [[floating exchange rate]]s, a phenomenon not widely seen since the 1930s "[[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm School]]" successfully lobbied [[Sweden]] to leave the [[gold standard]].

In 1962, along with [[Marcus Fleming]], he co-authored the [[Mundell–Fleming model]] of exchange rates, and noted that it was impossible to have domestic autonomy, fixed exchange rates, ''and'' free capital flows: no more than two of those objectives could be met. The model is, in effect, an extension of the [[IS/LM model]] applied to currency rates.

According to Mundell's analysis:
* Discipline under the [[Bretton Woods system]] was more due to the US [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] than to the discipline of gold.
* Demand side [[fiscal policy]] would be ineffective in restraining [[central bank]]s under a floating exchange rate system.
* Single currency zones relied, therefore, on similar levels of price stability, where a single monetary policy would suffice for all.

His analysis led to his conclusion that it was a disagreement between [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] over the rate of inflation, partially to finance the [[Vietnam War]], and that Bretton Woods disintegrated because of the undervaluing of gold and the consequent monetary discipline breakdown. There is a famous point/counterpoint over this issue between Mundell and [[Milton Friedman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may01/friedman.pdf |title=Mundell-Friedman debate |access-date=January 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118064601/http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may01/friedman.pdf |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

This work later led to the creation of the [[euro]] and his prediction that leaving the Bretton Woods system would lead to "[[stagflation]]" so long as highly progressive income tax rates applied. In 1974, he advocated a drastic tax reduction and a flattening of income tax rates.

Mundell, though lionized by some conservatives, has many of his harshest critics from the right: he denied the need for a fixed gold-based currency or currency board {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} (he still often recommended this as a policy in [[hyperinflation]]ary environments) and he was both a fiscal and [[balance of payments]] deficit hawk. He is well known for stating that in a floating exchange rate system, expansion of the money supply can come about only by a positive balance of payments.

In 2000, Mundell recommended that [[Canada]] permanently tie [[Canadian dollar|its dollar]]'s value to the [[American dollar|U.S. dollar]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Economist says tie dollar to U.S.|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economist-says-tie-dollar-to-us/article4161769/|access-date=2020-06-29}}</ref>

==Father of the euro==

Robert Mundell was considered the "father of the [[euro]]" for his early work encouraging a European monetary union.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Redburn|first=Tom|date=2021-04-05|title=Robert A. Mundell, a Father of the Euro and Reaganomics, Dies at 88|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/business/economy/robert-mundell-dead.html|access-date=2021-04-05|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Starting in the 1960s, Mundell supported the constitution of a [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|European Economic and Monetary Union]] and pushed for the creation of the euro.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 2001|title=ONE WORLD, ONE MONEY?|url=https://web.ntpu.edu.tw/~guan/courses/Friedman-Mundell.pdf}}</ref>

In 2000, he predicted that before 2010, the [[eurozone]] would expand to cover 50 countries, while the U.S. dollar would spread throughout Latin America, and much of Asia would look towards the yen.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Milner and Charlotte Denny |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/14/9 |title=The new endangered species &#124; Business |newspaper=The Guardian |date= January 14, 2000|access-date=January 1, 2012 |location=London}}</ref> Such predictions have proved highly inaccurate.

In his 2012 article "Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro", [[Greg Palast]] affirms that Mundell advocated for the euro because its implementation would have the effect of removing democratic control over [[monetary policy]]. As such, when a crisis hits, eurozone governments would not be able to stimulate the economy by creating money, as is prescribed by [[Keynesian economics]]. They would thus be forced to resort to other means to curtail unemployment, such as deregulating businesses, privatizing state industries, cutting taxes, and weakening the [[social safety net]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Palast|first=Greg|date=2012-06-26|title=Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro {{!}} Greg Palast|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/robert-mundell-evil-genius-euro|access-date=2020-06-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In 2014, Mundell voiced his opposition to proposals of a [[fiscal union]] between the European states. He declared that "it would be insane to have a central European authority that controls all the taxes and duties of the states ... controlled in the Union. This transfer of sovereignty is far too big". He also voiced his opposition to the prospect that countries could be liable for other countries' debt.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.focus.de/finanzen/doenchkolumne/vater-des-euro-fleht-eurozone-muss-zurueck-auf-los_aid_897745.html |language=de |title=Vater des Euro fleht: Eurozone muss zurück auf "Los" |date=July 29, 2014 |access-date=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

== Awards and honours ==
Mundell was awarded the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1971 and the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|title=John Simon Guggenheim Foundation {{!}} Robert A. Mundell|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/robert-a-mundell/|access-date=2021-04-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1999|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1999/mundell/facts/|access-date=2021-04-06|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2002 he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Order of Canada|url=https://archive.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&TypeID=orc&id=6874|access-date=2021-04-06|website=archive.gg.ca}}</ref>

In 1992, Mundell received a [[Docteur Honoris Causa|Docteur honouris Causa]] from the [[University of Paris]]. Mundell's honorary professorships and fellowships were from [[Brookings Institution]], the University of Chicago, the [[University of Southern California]], [[McGill University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[Bologna Center]] and [[Renmin University of China]]. He became a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1998. In June 2005 he was awarded the Global Economics Prize World Economics Institute in [[Kiel]], [[Germany]], and in September 2005 he was made a ''Cavaliere di Gran Croce del Reale Ordine del Merito sotto il Titolo di San Ludovico'' by Principe Don Carlo Ugo di Borbone Parma.

The [[Mundell International University of Entrepreneurship]] in the [[Zhongguancun]] district of [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China]], is named in his honour.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2004-10-29|title=University Named After 'Father of the Euro' Inaugurated|url=http://english.china.org.cn/english/culture/110708.htm|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-05|website=english.china.org.cn}}</ref>

Mundell won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1999 and gave as his prize lecture a speech titled "A Reconsideration of the Twentieth Century". According to the Nobel Prize Committee, he got the honour for "his analysis of monetary and fiscal policy under different exchange rate regimes and his analysis of optimum currency areas".

Mundell concluded in that lecture that "the international monetary system depends only on the power configuration of the countries that make it up". He divided the entire twentieth century into three parts by different periods of time:
* The first third of the century, from its beginning to the Great Depression of the 1930s, economics was dominated by the confrontation of the Federal Reserve System with the gold standard.
* The second third of the century was from World War II to 1973, when the international monetary system was dominated by fixing the price of gold with the US dollar.
* The last third of the century started with the destruction of the old monetary system due to the problem of inflation.

With the destruction of the old monetary system, a new international monetary system was finally founded. Controlling inflation by each country became a main topic during this era.
