'''Jerre Levy''' (born April 7, 1938) is an American psychologist and researcher of the brain. She has studied the relationship between the [[cerebral hemispheres]] and [[visual]]-oriented versus [[language]]-oriented tasks in [[split-brain]] surgery patients.<ref name="Yount"/>

Jerre Levy was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on April 7, 1938. She earned a degree in psychology from the [[University of Miami]] in 1962. She attended graduate school there for a year and a half before transferring to [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], where she worked in [[Roger Sperry]]'s laboratory. She received her PhD in 1970. From 1972 to 1977 Levy taught at the University of Pennsylvania. She then became a professor at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="Yount">{{cite book|last=Yount|first=Lisa|title=A to Z of Women in Science and Math|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4381-0795-0|pages=175–176|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=428i2UdWRRAC&q=Jerre%20Levy&pg=PA175|edition=Rev.|chapter=Levy, Jerre}}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}</ref>

She has also found evidence that the [[left hemisphere]] specializes in [[Linearity|linear]] [[reason]]ing, while the [[right brain]] is more involved in [[holistic]] reasoning.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

She claims that the two hemispheres of the [[brain]] work together for every human function rather than act as two separate brains, as Sperry believed.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}
