{{nihongo|'''Michio Morishima'''|森嶋 通夫|Morishima Michio|extra=July 18, 1923 – July 13, 2004}} was a Japanese [[heterodox economist]] and [[public intellectual]] who was the Sir John Hicks Professor of Economics at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1970–88. He was also professor at [[Osaka University]] and member of the [[British Academy]]. In 1976 he won the Order of Culture (文化勲章, Bunka-kunshō).

==Career==
Originally desiring a career as a [[historical novelist]], at the university Morishima pursued [[social science]], studying both [[economics]] and [[sociology]] under [[Yasuma Takada]]. At [[Kyoto University]], Morishima was rigorously trained in both mainstream [[neoclassical economic theory]] and [[Marxian economics]]. Mathematically gifted, in 1946, he graduated from Kyoto University and taught there in addition to [[Osaka University]]. He started [http://www.iser.osaka-u.ac.jp/index-e.html Institute of Social and Economic Research] (ISER) of Osaka University with [[Yasuma Takada]].

In 1960 he established with Nobel-laureate [[Lawrence R. Klein]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania Economics Department|Economics Department]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] the [[International Economic Review]] (today published by Penn), which grew to become one of the leading journals in economics in the world.<ref>[http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/09/05/Engemann.pdf "A Journal Ranking for the Ambitious Economist"]</ref>

In 1965, he became the first Japanese president of the [[Econometric Society]]. By all accounts, [[John Hicks]] was a committed advocate of Morishima's careership in England.

In 1968, he immigrated to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], teaching at [[University of Essex]], then accepting an endowed chair at the LSE in 1970.

Later, he started the project that led to the establishment of the [[Suntory]]-[[Toyota]] Foundation and the Suntory and Toyota International Centres for Economic and Related Disciplines ([http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/default.asp STICERD]) at LSE. He was STICERD's first chairman. In 1991 he was elected Honorary Fellow of the LSE.<ref>Refer to [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/newsAndEvents/archives LSE HP]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Contributions==
Morishima's three-volume work reinterpreting and synthesizing economic ideas in the major writings of [[David Ricardo]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Léon Walras]], now largely forgotten, represents one of the high points of the radical political economy of the 1970s [[New Left]] in North America. His intense interest in [[general equilibrium theory]], [[classical political economy]], and [[capitalism]] drove this work. Based on LSE lectures, these books worked towards the accommodation of [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s 1937 multi-sectoral growth model to a general equilibrium model. Considering the work of these theorists to be [[David Ricardo|Ricardian]], his three books worked to show that the modification of them along von Neumann lines elucidates the theoretical similarities and differences between the positions.
