== Early life and education ==
Weisbrot was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] with a bachelor's degree in economics. Weisbrot received his [[Ph.D.]] in economics from the [[University of Michigan]].<ref name=PhDIdeologyMethodEconomics>{{cite book|last1=Weisbrot|first1=Mark Alan|title=Ideology and Method in the History of Development Economics|date=1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|location=Ann Arbor, MI|format=Thesis/dissertation|oclc=68796746}}</ref>

== Career ==
In 1999, Weisbrot co-founded, together with economist [[Dean Baker]], the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] (CEPR), a [[think tank]] which produces economic research on topics that affect people's lives to contribute to the public debate in the U.S. (inequality, macroeconomic policy and stability, labor markets, health and social programs, intellectual property, social security), and internationally: globalization and trade, the International Monetary Fund and institutions of global governance, Latin American and European economies, and US foreign policy.<ref name=CEPR-ClosingGap-Video-2011>{{cite web|last1=K.S.|first1=Jomo|last2=Weisbrot|first2=Mark|last3=James|first3=Deborah|title=The Scorecard on Development, 1960-2010: Closing the Gap?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpe_jrKYbjA|website=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]|format=Video|date=15 April 2011}}</ref>

Weisbrot provided testimony to [[United States congressional hearing|Congressional hearings]] in 2002 to a [[United States House of Representatives]] committee on the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)]] and in 2004 to the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] on the state of democracy in Venezuela with what he claimed were U.S. efforts to undermine the government, and the [[media representation of Hugo Chávez|media inside the country]].<ref name=USHouseGov-FinancialServices-Argentina-2002>{{cite book|last1=Weisbrot|first1=Mark|title=Argentina's Economic Meltdown: Causes and Remedies|date=5 March 2002|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]], Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy and Trade, Committee on Financial Services|location=Washington, DC|pages=44–47, 118–128|chapter-url=http://financialservices.house.gov/media/pdf/107-52.pdf|chapter=Statement of Dr. Mark Weisbrot, Co-Director, Center for Economic and Policy Research}}</ref><ref name=USCongress-ForeignRelations-Venezuela-2004>{{cite book|last1=Weisbrot|first1=Mark|title=The State of Democracy in Venezuela|date=24 June 2004|publisher=Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs on the Committee on Foreign Relations, [[United States Senate]]|location=Washington, DC|pages=61–64|chapter-url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108shrg96730/html/CHRG-108shrg96730.htm|chapter=Statement of Dr. Mark Weisbrot, Co-Director, Center for Economic and Policy Research}}</ref>

As an economist, Weisbrot has opposed [[privatization]] of the [[Social Security (United States)|United States Social Security system]] and has been critical of neoliberal [[globalization]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). His work on Greece's ongoing debt crisis has influenced the debate over what measures the Greek government should take in negotiating a solution with the [[European Central Bank]], [[European Commission]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref name=ElPais-Greece-2012>{{cite news|last1=Mars|first1=Amanda|title=Grecia solo ve pobreza: El país afronta un rescate plagado de austeridad y de incertidumbre Las agencias siguen alertando del peligro de una bancarrota helena|url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2012/03/03/actualidad/1330808582_087061.html|work=[[El País]]|date=4 March 2012|language=es}}</ref><ref name=ModernMoneyNetwork-Syriza-Pt2-2013>{{cite news|last1=Weisbrot|first1=Mark|last2=Antonopolous|first2=Rania|last3=Milios|first3=Yiannis|last4=Ginsburg|first4=Helen|last5=Grey|first5=Rohan|last6=Tsipras|first6=Alexis|title=Modern Money and Public Purpose: An Evening with Syriza: On Greece and the Eurozone - Part 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVIzDxmV0U4|work=Modern Money Network|date=24 January 2013|format=Video}}</ref>

===Globalization===
Weisbrot argues that globalization as promoted by the United States government and multilateral lending institutions such as the IMF and the [[World Bank]] has failed poorer countries, stating that "no nation has ever pulled itself out of poverty under the conditions that Washington imposes on underdeveloped countries."<ref name=RiseGlobalEconomy-Kahn-Globalization-2002>{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Joseph|editor1-last=Veseth|editor1-first=Michael|title=The Rise of the Global Economy|date=2002|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=Chicago, IL|page=[https://archive.org/details/riseofglobalecon0000unse/page/22 22]|isbn=978-1-579-58369-9|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/riseofglobalecon0000unse|chapter=Globalization: Unspeakable, Yes, But is it Really Evil?

Weisbrot co-authors with CEPR a series of papers looking at the progress in economic growth and social indicators. In 2017, he presented the most recent report, which emphasized the role of China, with Sachs in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cepr.net/publications/ceprs-scorecard-series/|title=Scorecard Series|website=cepr.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref>

Weisbrot has continued to suggest that the founding of other alternative lending and finance institutions that do not include participation by the U.S., such as those being created by the [[BRICS]] countries, may have positive implications both for borrowing countries and in terms of weakening the influence of Washington-based institutions like the IMF.<ref name="AlJazeera-BRICS-2014">{{cite news|last1=Weisbrot|first1=Mark|title=Opinion: BRICS' new financial institutions could undermine US-EU global dominance|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/7/brics-developmentbankimffinance.html|work=[[Al Jazeera America]]|date=18 July 2014}}</ref>

===Latin America===
[[File:Mark Weisbrot.jpg|thumb|left|Weisbrot in 2017]]
Weisbrot has written and co-authored research papers and articles on the economies and politics of Latin America and the Caribbean for the past two decades. The countries covered include Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, and Venezuela.

Beginning in 2001, Weisbrot challenged the prevailing consensus on the [[Argentine economic crisis]], arguing that IMF-supported austerity was counter-productive and that the country needed to devalue its currency in order to recover. After the Argentine government defaulted on its debt at the end of 2001, and allowed the currency to float against the dollar at the beginning of 2002, Weisbrot continued to argue against what he called harmful attempts by the IMF to influence policy in the post-default period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/world/americas/argentinas-economic-rally-defies-forecasts.html|title=Argentina's Economic Rally Defies Forecasts|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=26 December 2004|website=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He later wrote papers arguing the Argentina's policies in the 2002-2011 period, after its default and separation from the IMF, were successful.

Weisbrot has argued that, from 2003 to 2011, Brazil was successful in reducing poverty and inequality, and increasing GDP growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cepr.net/documents/brazil-2014-09.pdf|title=The Brazilian Economy in Transition: Macroeconomic Policy, Labor and Inequality|last=Weisbrot|first=Mark, Jake Johnston, and Stephan Lefebvre|date=2014|website=www.cepr.net|accessdate=February 14, 2018}}</ref> Weisbrot attributed these successes in part to policy changes that were an improvement over the neoliberal program Brazil adopted in the 1980s. However, he was critical of austerity and high interest rates after 2010, arguing that these were unnecessary and led to a prolonged recession. Weisbrot argued against the impeachment of former Brazilian president [[Dilma Rousseff]] in 2016 and the corruption conviction of former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] in 2018, pointing to a lack of precedent and evidence to justify the proceedings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/opinion/brazil-lula-democracy-corruption.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Brazil's Democracy Pushed Into the Abyss|last=Weisbrot|first=Mark|date=2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In 2013, Weisbrot praised the Venezuelan government for its gains in poverty, real income, employment, healthcare, and education, and said that the possibility of hyperinflation was "very remote", that economic problems were "not likely" and that "Venezuela has sufficient reserves".<ref>Weisbrot, Mark.

A 2019 report by Weisbrot and [[Jeffrey Sachs]], claimed<!-- NOT WTA, the actual word used in the source, and for good reason because it is complete speculation--> that a 31% rise in the number of deaths between 2017 and 2018 was due to the [[International sanctions during the Venezuelan crisis|sanctions imposed on Venezuela in 2017]], and that 40,000 people in Venezuela may have died as a result.<ref name=Independent>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/venezuela-sanctions-us-excess-death-toll-economy-oil-trump-maduro-juan-guaido-jeffrey-sachs-a8888516.html?amp |work= The Independent |title= US sanctions on Venezuela responsible for 'tens of thousands' of deaths, claims new report |author= Buncombe, Andrew |date= 26 April 2019 |accessdate= 4 May 2019}}</ref> The report states: "The sanctions are depriving Venezuelans of lifesaving medicines, medical equipment, food, and other essential imports."<ref name= Independent/> Weisbrot stated that he "could not prove those excess deaths were the result of sanctions, but said the increase ran parallel to the imposition of the measures and an attendant fall in oil production".<ref name= Independent/> A US State Department spokesperson said that, "as the writers themselves concede, the report is based on speculation and conjecture"  and "the economic situation in Venezuela has been deteriorating for decades, as Venezuelans themselves will confirm, thanks to Maduro's ineptitude and economic mismanagement."<ref name= Independent/> Harvard economist [[Ricardo Hausmann]], [[Juan Guaidó]]'s representative to the [[Inter-American Development Bank]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-hausmann/venezuelas-guaido-pushes-to-name-new-representative-to-regional-lender-idUSKCN1QL2A6|title=Venezuela's Guiado pushes to name new representative to regional lender|publisher=Reuters|date= 4 March 2019|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> said that the analysis was flawed because it made invalid assumptions about Venezuela based on a different country, Colombia, and that "taking what happened in Colombia since 2017 as a counterfactual for what would have happened in Venezuela if there had been no financial sanctions makes no sense".

==== ''South of the Border'' ====
Weisbrot was an advisor,<ref name=TodayShow-SouthOfBorder-2009>{{cite news|title=Chavez gets red-carpet treatment in Venice|url=http://www.today.com/id/32723247#.WPwLwVPyvXE|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]|publisher=[[The Associated Press]]|date=7 September 2009}}</ref> and co-wrote with [[Tariq Ali]] the screenplay for the [[Oliver Stone]]'s 2009 film, ''[[South of the Border (2009 film)|South of the Border]]'',<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/10/01/south_of_the_border_movie_review____south_of_the_border_showtimes/ |title= Movie Review: South of the Border |work= The Boston Globe |author= Gilsdorf, Ethan | date=  October 1, 2010 |accessdate= March 18, 2018}}</ref> which examined the "[[pink tide]]" of elected [[leftist]] governments in South America.

Weisbrot disagreed with [[Larry Rohter]], the former South American bureau chief of ''[[The New York Times]]'', over his statements on Venezuela, where Rohter claimed that in support of the film ''South of the Border,'' Weisbrot, [[Tariq Ali]], and [[Oliver Stone]] manipulated data to present a positive image of Hugo Chávez.<ref name=LRStone>{{cite news|last1=Rohter|first1=Larry|title=Oliver Stone Still Doesn't Get It|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/129458|work=[[History News Network]]|date=26 July 2010}}</ref> Rohter described Weisbrot as "... an economist, not a historian, and apparently not a very good one", suggesting that he was "Either ... incompetent [or] deliberately manipulating the numbers."<ref name= LRStone/>  Weisbrot contested the claims of inaccuracies, suggesting that they are indicative of sloppy and misleading coverage of Venezuela in the popular press, and saying that "the way most Americans get the idea that Venezuela is a dictatorship, for example, is from these editorials".<ref name=FAIR-SouthOfTheBorder-2010>{{cite news|last1=Weisbrot|first1=Mark|last2=Serwer|first2=Adam|title=Adam Serwer on DOJ/New Black Panthers, Mark Weisbrot on South of the Border|url=http://fair.org/counterspin/adam-serwer-on-dojnew-black-panthers-mark-weisbrot-on-south-of-the-border/|work=CounterSpin, [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]|date=16 July 2010|format=Includes audio}}</ref>

=== Books ===
Weisbrot is co-author, with Baker, of ''Social Security: The Phony Crisis'' ([[University of Chicago Press]], 1999). In the book, Weisbrot and Baker argue that much of the [[Social Security debate (United States)|United States Social Security debate]] has been based on misconceptions, that privatization would be unlikely to improve the system, and that the system, in fact, performs satisfactorily and does not need substantial changes, needing only minor adjustments to in order to continue to pay all promised benefits for the ensuing 75 years.<ref name=SocialSecurityPhonyCrisis-1999>{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Dean|last2=Weisbrot|first2=Mark|title=Social Security: The Phony Crisis|date=1999|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0-226-03544-4|url=https://archive.org/details/socialsecurityph00bake|oclc=41090883}}</ref> In reviewing the book, ''The Economist'' wrote that “Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot have no trouble at all demonstrating that even on highly conservative assumptions about economic growth, the much-forecast insolvency of the Social Security system by about 2030 is most unlikely to happen then, if indeed ever.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/301994|title=All-clear?|date=2000-04-13|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-06-18|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

Weisbrot's latest book is ''Failed: What the Experts Got Wrong About the Global Economy'' (Oxford University Press, 2015).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/failed-9780195170184?cc=us&lang=en&|title=Failed: What the "Experts" Got Wrong about the Global Economy|date=2015-10-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195170184|location=Oxford, New York}}</ref> In an interview, Weisbrot described the book as critiquing the bad macroeconomic policies often imposed by European authorities, who are ultimately unaccountable to the citizens of the sovereign states that they represent. These policies, he says, prolonged the economic crises in the aftermath of the [[Great Recession]] in Europe, which had a much higher unemployment rate than in the U.S., and forced unpopular economic policies of more vulnerable European countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=17012|title=Failed: What the "Experts" Got Wrong on the Global Economy|date=2016-08-20|work=The Real News Network|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en-gb}}</ref> Weisbrot has made these arguments in various contexts over the years, for example on Greece,<ref>

== Reception ==
[[Francisco Rodríguez (economist)|Francisco Rodríguez]], an economist of [[Wesleyan University]] accused Weisbrot of being biased for praising Hugo Chávez's economic policies and stated that Weisbrot's work had a "use of heavily slanted data".<ref name="FRweisbrot">{{cite web|url=http://frrodriguez.web.wesleyan.edu/docs/working_papers/How_Not_to_Defend.pdf|title=How Not to Defend the Revolution: Mark Weisbrot and the Misinterpretation of Venezuelan Evidence|last=Rodríguez|first=Francisco|publisher=Wesleyan University|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref>

In a ''[[History News Network]]'' article, [[Larry Rohter]], the former South American bureau chief of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that Weisbrot along with his colleague [[Tariq Ali]] "have sent to a number of news organizations and websites" claims that were "full of indisputably false assertions". Rohter also says that Weisbrot manipulated data to give a positive image of Hugo Chávez in the film ''South of the Border''.<ref name= LRStone/> Weisbrot defended his work saying that Rohter didn't find any inaccuracies and that Rohter "tried rather desperately" to find inaccuracies that no one would notice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fair.org/counterspin-radio/adam-serwer-on-dojnew-black-panthers-mark-weisbrot-on-south-of-the-border/|title=Adam Serwer on DOJ/New Black Panthers, Mark Weisbrot on South of the Border|publisher=Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=2010-07-16}}</ref>
