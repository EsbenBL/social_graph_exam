==Career==
In 2002, Baldez published the book ''Why Women Protest: Women's Movements in Chile'', in which she studies what causes women to protest, and in what situations they make their gender identity salient as part of their protests.<ref name=noonan>{{cite journal |first=Rita K. |last=Noonan |title=Review of Why Women Protest: Women's Movements in Chile |journal=Contemporary Sociology |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=231–232 |date=1 March 2004 |doi=10.1177/009430610403300260|s2cid=151951464 }}</ref> Baldez focuses on the struggle for [[women's suffrage]] in Chile,<ref>{{cite journal |first=Victor P. |last=Unda |title=Review of Why Women Protest: Women's Movements in Chile |journal=Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=112–114 |date=1 January 2005 |doi=10.2307/3655060 |jstor=3655060 }}</ref> as well as on two major episodes of protests by women in Chile during the 1970s and 1980s: the protests against [[Salvador Allende]] and against [[Augusto Pinochet]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Patricia |last=Tomic |title=Review of Why Women Protest: Women's Movements in Chile |journal=Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies |volume=28 |issue=55/56 |pages=305–307 |year=2003}}</ref> In both of these cases women's political mobilization was a major factor in undermining the legitimacy of a regime, even though these movements were in many ways ideologically opposite.<ref name=noonan/> Baldez theorizes that women form major social movements when partisan realignment gives them the opportunity to do so, and they are able to frame their exclusion from public life as a reason to protest apart from partisan differences.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Elisabeth Jay |last=Friedman |title=Review of Why Women Protest: Women's Movements in Chile |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=531–532 |date=1 October 2003|doi=10.1002/j.1538-165X.2003.tb01247.x }}</ref> She tests this idea using [[archive|archival material]] and [[Interview (research)|research interviews]] with activists who were involved in the two movements.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Liesl |last=Haas |title=Review of Why Women Protest: Women's Movements in Chile |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=799–800 |date=1 December 2004}}</ref>

Baldez published a second book, ''Defying Convention: US Resistance to the UN Treaty on Women's Rights'', in 2014. In ''Defying Convention'', Baldez studies why the United States was one of very few countries that had not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which pledges to put an end to war and establishes gender equality.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jocelyn |last=Olcott |title=Review of Defying Convention: US Resistance to the UN Treaty on Women's Rights |journal=Journal of American Studies |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=1295–1297 |date=November 2017 |doi=10.1017/S0021875817001098}}</ref> Baldez examines this decision in the context of the historical development of a global [[Social norm|norm]] of women's rights, and attributes American non-ratification partly to division among women's groups domestically on how best to achieve gender equality, and partly to United States obstructionism at the UN towards any initiatives by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies.<ref name=davis>{{cite journal |first=Martha |last=Davis |title=Review of Defying Convention: US Resistance to the UN Treaty on Women's Rights |journal=Journal of Human Rights |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=571–573 |date=1 October 2016 |doi=10.1080/14754835.2016.1165089|s2cid=147741274 }}</ref> She also studies how the interpretation of the text of the treaty evolved in the years after its drafting, so that the effective meaning of ratifying the treaty might be understood to have changed over time, which complicates the study of why the United States did not ratify the text in different periods.<ref name=davis/> Baldez structures her discussion using historical [[process tracing]], and compares the possibility of America ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women to its ratification of the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] nearly 30 years after that convention's initial drafting.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Lana |last=Obradovic |title=Review of Defying Convention: US Resistance to the UN Treaty on Women's Rights |journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=515–517 |date=3 July 2015 |doi=10.1080/14616742.2015.1055140|s2cid=147070159 }}</ref> ''Defying Convention'' won the 2015 [[Victoria Schuck Award]] from the American Political Science Association, which is given each year for "the best book published on women and politics" in the previous year.<ref name=schuck>{{cite web |url=https://www.apsanet.org/PROGRAMS/APSA-Awards/Victoria-Schuck-Award |title=Victoria Schuck Award |publisher=American Political Science Association |year=2019 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref> It also won the 2015 Best Book Award from the Human Rights Section of the American Political Science Association.<ref name=besthr>{{cite web |url=https://www.apsanet.org/section-36-best-book-award |title=Best Book Award |publisher=American Political Science Association |year=2015 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>
