==Biography==
Sahlins was born in [[Chicago]], the son of Bertha (Skud) and Paul A. Sahlins. His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants.<ref>https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q2S8-HRTM</ref> His father was a doctor while his mother was a homemaker.<ref name=":0" /> He grew up in a secular, non-practicing family. His family claims to be descended from [[Baal Shem Tov]], a mystical rabbi considered to be the founder of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. Sahlins' mother admired [[Emma Goldman]] and was a political activist as a child in Russia.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Interview with Marshall Sahlins|journal=Anthropological Theory|volume=8|issue=3|year=2008|pages=319–328|issn=1463-4996|doi=10.1177/1463499608093817|s2cid=220712631}}</ref> 

Sahlins received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees at the [[University of Michigan]] where he studied with evolutionary anthropologist [[Leslie White]]. He earned his PhD at [[Columbia University]] in 1954.<ref name=":0" /> There his intellectual influences included [[Eric Wolf]], [[Morton Fried]], [[Sidney Mintz]], and the economic historian [[Karl Polanyi]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Golub|first1=Alex|title=Marshall Sahlins|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0076.xml#obo-9780199766567-0076-bibItem-0013|website=Oxford Bibliographies Online|access-date=23 May 2015}}</ref> In 1957, he became assistant professor at the University of Michigan.<ref name=":0" /> In the 1960s he became politically active, and while protesting against the [[Vietnam War]], Sahlins coined the term for the imaginative form of protest now called the "[[teach-in]]", which drew inspiration from the [[sit-in]] pioneered during the civil rights movement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sahlins|first1=Marshall|title=The Teach-Ins: Anti-War Protest in the Old Stoned Age|journal=Anthropology Today|date=February 2009|volume=25|issue=1|pages=3–5|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8322.2009.00639.x}}</ref> In 1968, Sahlins signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968, ''New York Post''</ref> In the late 1960s, he also spent two years in Paris, where he was exposed to French intellectual life (and particularly the work of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]) and the student protests of May 1968. In 1973, he took a position in the anthropology department at the [[University of Chicago]], where he was the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology Emeritus. His commitment to activism continued throughout his time at Chicago, most recently leading to his protest over the opening of the university's [[Confucius Institute]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sahlins|first1=Marshall|title=China U|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/176888/china-u|access-date=23 May 2015|agency=The Nation|date=November 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Redden|first1=Elizabeth|title=Rejecting Confucius Funding|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/04/29/chicago-faculty-object-their-campuss-confucius-institute|access-date=23 May 2015|agency=Inside Higher Ed|date=April 29, 2014}}</ref> (which later closed in the fall of 2014).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Redden|first1=Elizabeth|title=Chicago to Close Confucius Institute|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/09/26/chicago-severs-ties-chinese-government-funded-confucius-institute|access-date=23 May 2015|agency=Inside Higher Ed|date=September 26, 2014}}</ref> On February 23, 2013, Sahlins resigned from the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to protest the call for military research for improving the effectiveness of small combat groups and also the election of [[Napoleon Chagnon]].  The resignation followed the publication in that month of Chagnon's memoir and widespread coverage of the memoir, including a profile of Chagnon in the ''New York Times'' magazine.<ref>Serena Golden, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/02/25/prominent-anthropologist-resigns-protest-national-academy-sciences "A Protest Resignation"], Inside Higher Ed, February 25, 2013.</ref><ref>David Price, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/02/26/the-destruction-of-conscience-in-national-academy-of-sciences/ "The Destruction of Conscience in the National Academy of Sciences: An Interview with Marshall Sahlins"], CounterPunch, February 26, 2013.</ref>

Alongside his research and activism, Sahlins trained a host of students who went on to become prominent in the field. One such student, [[Gayle Rubin]], said: "Sahlins is a mesmerizing speaker and a brilliant thinker. By the time he finished the first lecture, I was hooked."<ref>Rubin, Gayle. ''Deviations: Gayle Rubin Reader''. Durham: Duke University Press, 2011, p. 24.</ref>

In 2001, Sahlins became publisher of Prickly Pear Pamphlets, which was started in 1993 by anthropologists [[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]] and Anna Grimshaw, and was renamed [[Prickly Paradigm Press]]. The imprint specializes in small pamphlets on unconventional subjects in anthropology, critical theory, philosophy, and current events.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://prickly-paradigm.com/index.html|website=Prickly Paradigm Press}}</ref> He died on April 5, 2021 at the age of 90 in Chicago.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/us/marshall-d-sahlins-dead.html|title=Marshall D.

His brother was the writer and comedian [[Bernard Sahlins]] (1922–2013).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/bernie-sahlins-co-founder-of-comedy-troupe-dies-at-90/2013/06/19/4225c432-d78b-11e2-9df4-895344c13c30_story.html |title=Bernie Sahlins, co-founder of comedy troupe, dies at 90}}</ref> His son, [[Peter Sahlins]], is a historian.<ref name="Preface">{{Cite book |title=Unnaturally French: Foreign Citizens in the Old Regime and After |last=Sahlins |first=Peter |year=2004}}</ref>

==Work==
Sahlins is known for theorizing the interaction of structure and agency, his critiques of reductive theories of human nature (economic and biological, in particular), and his demonstrations of the power that culture has to shape people's perceptions and actions.   Although his focus has been the entire [[Pacific]], Sahlins has done most of his research in [[Fiji]] and [[Hawaii]].

Poverty is not a certain small amount of goods, nor is it just a relation between means and ends; above all it is a relation between people. Poverty is a social status. As such it is the invention of civilization. It has grown with civilization, at once as an invidious distinction between classes and more importantly as a tributary relation."

===Early work===
Sahlins's training under Leslie White, a proponent of materialist and evolutionary anthropology at the University of Michigan, is reflected in his early work. In his ''Evolution and Culture'' (1960), he touched on the areas of [[cultural evolution]] and [[neoevolutionism]]. He divided the [[evolution of societies]] into "general" and "specific". General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organization and adaptiveness to environment. However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a [[Diffusionism|diffusion]] of their qualities (like technological [[invention]]s). This leads cultures to develop in different ways (specific evolution), as various elements are introduced to them in different combinations and on different stages of evolution.<ref name=Moore/> ''Moala'', Sahlins's first major monograph, exemplifies this approach.

===Contributions to economic anthropology===
''Stone Age Economics'' (1972) collects some of Sahlins's key essays in [[Formalist–substantivist debate|substantivist economic anthropology]]. As opposed to "formalists," substantivists insist that economic life is produced through cultural rules that govern the production and distribution of goods, and therefore any understanding of economic life has to start from cultural principles, and not from the assumption that the economy is made up of independently acting, "economically rational" individuals. Perhaps Sahlins's most famous essay from the collection, "[[Original affluent society|The Original Affluent Society]]," elaborates on this theme through an extended meditation on "hunter-gatherer" societies. ''Stone Age Economics'' inaugurated Sahlins's persistent critique of the discipline of [[economics]], particularly in its [[Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical]] form.

===Contributions to historical anthropology===
After the publication of ''Culture and Practical Reason'' in 1976, his focus shifted to the relation between [[Historical anthropology|history and anthropology]], and the way different cultures understand and make history. Of central concern in this work is the problem of historical transformation, which [[Structuralism|structuralist]] approaches could not adequately account for. Sahlins developed the concept of the "structure of the conjuncture" to grapple with the problem of structure and agency, in other words that societies were shaped by the complex conjuncture of a variety of forces, or structures. Earlier evolutionary models, by contrast, claimed that culture arose as an adaptation to the natural environment. Crucially, in Sahlins's formulation, individuals have the agency to make history. Sometimes their position gives them power by placing them at the top of a political hierarchy. At other times, the structure of the conjuncture, a potent or fortuitous mixture of forces, enables people to transform history. This element of chance and contingency makes a science of these conjunctures impossible, though comparative study can enable some generalizations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Golub|first1=Alex|title=Theory in Social and Cultural Anthropology: An Encyclopedia|date=2013|publisher=Sage|isbn=9781412999632|page=734}}</ref> ''Historical Metaphors and Mythical Realities'' (1981), ''Islands of History'' (1985), ''Anahulu'' (1992), and ''Apologies to Thucydides'' (2004) contain his main contributions to historical anthropology.

''Islands of History'' sparked [[Sahlins–Obeyesekere debate|a notable debate]] with [[Gananath Obeyesekere]] over the details of [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook's]] death in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1779. At the heart of the debate was how to understand the rationality of indigenous people. Obeyesekere insisted that indigenous people thought in essentially the same way as [[Westerners]] and was concerned that any argument otherwise would paint them as "irrational" and "uncivilized". In contrast Sahlins argued that each culture may have different types of rationality that make sense of the world by focusing on different patterns and explain them within specific cultural narratives, and that assuming that all cultures lead to a single rational view is a form of eurocentrism.<ref name=Moore/>

===Centrality of culture===
Over the years, Sahlins took aim at various forms of economic determinism (mentioned above) and also [[biological determinism]], or the idea that human culture is a by-product of biological processes. His major critique of sociobiology is contained in ''The Use and Abuse of Biology''. His 2013 book, ''What Kinship Is—And Is Not'' picks up some of these threads to show how kinship organizes sexuality and human reproduction rather than the other way around. In other words, biology does not determine kinship. Rather, the experience of "mutuality of being" that we call kinship is a cultural phenomenon.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sahlins|first1=Marshall|title=What Kinship Is--And Is Not|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226214290}}</ref>
