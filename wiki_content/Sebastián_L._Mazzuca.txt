'''Sebastián L. Mazzuca''' is a professor of [[political science]] specializing in [[comparative politics]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He is known for his research on [[state formation]].

==Career==
Mazzuca earned his MA in [[Economics]] and his PhD in [[Political Science]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="auto"/> He studied with [[David Collier (political scientist)| David Collier]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]].

After teaching at [[Harvard University]], and the [[National University of General San Martín]] in Buenos Aires, he returned to the United States and began teaching at Johns Hopkins University. 

==Academic research==
Mazzuca works in the field of [[comparative politics]] specializing in [[state formation]], [[state building]], and [[democracy]].<ref>Sebastián L.

Mazzuca is known for introducing the distinction between the access to [[Power (social and political)|power]] and the exercise of power. He argues that the distinction between [[authoritarianism]] and [[democracy]] concerns the access to power dimension. In contrast, the distinction between [[patrimonialism]] and bureaucracy concerns the exercise of power dimension.<ref>Sebastián L. Mazzuca, "Access to power versus exercise of power: Reconceptualizing the quality of democracy in Latin America," ''Studies in Comparative International Development'' 45,3 (2010), 334-357.[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.840.9749&rep=rep1&type=pdf]</ref>

Mazzuca's work on state formation,<ref>Sebastián Mazzuca, ''Latecomer State Formation: Political Geography and Capacity Failure in Latin America.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021, p. 14.</ref> and on economic development,<ref>Sebastián L. Mazzuca, “Critical Juncture and Legacies: State Formation and Economic Performance in Latin America“ ''Qualitative & Multi-Method Research'' Vol. 15, No. 1 (2017): 29-35.</ref> has been seen as a contribution to [[critical juncture theory]].

===The state and democracy===
Mazzuca, in his work with [[Gerardo L. Munck]], has advanced the argument that the process of [[state formation]], and the resulting level of [[state capacity]], affects the process of democratization as well as the quality of democracy. In ''A Middle-quality Institutional Trap'' (2020), Mazzuca and Munck maintain that "States can make democracy and democracy can make States," but that they do so "only under certain macroconditions, which trigger the causal mechanisms that make the State–democracy interaction a virtuous cycle." They compare advanced democracies to Latin America and show that "in Latin America, the State–democracy interaction has not generated a virtuous cycle." They explain the poor quality of Latin American democracies in terms of various factors, including the legacy of state formation in the nineteenth century.<ref>Sebastián L. Mazzuca and Gerardo L. Munck, ''A Middle-quality Institutional Trap: Democracy and State Capacity in Latin America.'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2020, p. 63.</ref>

===''Latecomer State Formation''===
Mazzuca's book ''Latecomer State Formation. Political Geography and Capacity Failure in Latin America'' (2021) has been praised as a "dazzling and conceptually innovative book" that offers "an empirically convincing positive theory of state formation," and as "a pathbreaking account of ... state formation in Latin America."<ref>Statements by Maya Tudor, James A Robinson, and Steven Levitsky on back cover of Sebastián L. Mazzuca, ''Latecomer State Formation: Political Geography and Capacity Failure in Latin America.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021.</ref> 

''Latecomer State Formation'' is a cross-regional study of state formation, that contrasts the pattern of state formation in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]]. One of its key arguments is that state formation in Latin America was trade-led rather than war-led and that this difference explains why Latin American states have low [[state capacity]] relative to their European counterparts. In early modern western Europe, Mazzuca argues, "state formation had multiple linkages to state building. Violence monopolization required great efforts at fiscal extraction, which in turn caused the abolition of the intermediary power of local potentates and incited social demands for new public goods." In contrast, in Latin America, "the obstacles to the development of state capacities were the result of mutually convenient bargains struck by central state-makers and peripheral potentates, who, far from being eliminated during state formation, obtained institutional power to reinforce local bastions."<ref>Sebastián Mazzuca, ''Latecomer State Formation: Political Geography and Capacity Failure in Latin America.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021, p. 2.</ref>

''Latecomer State Formation'' also holds that three pathways were followed in forming Latin American states. These three paths are distinguished by the key agent in the process of state formation. (1) In the "port-driven pathway" - followed by [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] -  territorial consolidation and violence monopolization is simultaneously achieved. The result are "territorial colossuses." (2) In the "party-driven pathway" - followed by [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]] - there is "a temporal gap between territory consolidation and violence monopolization." However, this pathways created "states with large territories combining multiple economic regions." (3) Finally, the "lord-driven pathway" tends towards fragmentation and sampled states. In some cases, lords break up large-scale territorial projects - the cases of "[[José Antonio Páez|Antonio Páez]] in relation to [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]]’s [[Gran Colombia]] (Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, and Venezuela), [[Rafael Carrera]] in relation to the [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American Federation]], and [[Ramón Castilla]] in relation to the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]]." In other cases, lords form smaller states — the case of [[Venezuela]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Peru]].<ref>Sebastián Mazzuca, ''Latecomer State Formation: Political Geography and Capacity Failure in Latin America.''
