== Ancestry and early years ==

Miklouho-Maclay was born in a temporary workers' camp in Borovichi county (uyezd), [[Novgorod Governorate]] (currently [[Okulovsky District]] of [[Novgorod Oblast]]) in Russia, a son of a [[civil engineer]] working on the construction of the [[Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway|Moscow-St. Petersburg Railway]]. His [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] father, [[:ru:Миклуха, Николай Ильич|Nikolai Ilyich Myklukha]],<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet">{{cite web|author=Danylo Kulyniak|url=http://fleet.sebastopol.ua/articles/MIKLUHO-MAKLAY_%E2%80%94_LYuDINA_Z_MISYaCYa/printable/|script-title=uk:Миклухо-Маклай — людина з місяця|trans-title=Myklukho-Maklay - a person from the moon|language=uk|publisher=Ukrainian Ministry of Defence|date=8 June 1992|access-date=26 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125114317/http://fleet.sebastopol.ua/articles/MIKLUHO-MAKLAY_%E2%80%94_LYuDINA_Z_MISYaCYa/printable/|archive-date=25 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> was born in 1818,<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> in [[Starodub]],<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> [[Chernigov Governorate]], and descended from Stepan Myklukha, a [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Zaporozhian Cossack]] who was awarded the title of [[nobility|noble]] of the Empire by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] for his military exploits during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)]],<ref name="Thomassen">Thomassen, E.

<blockquote>My ancestors came originally from the [[Ukraine]], and were [[Zaporizhian Cossacks|Zaporogg-cossacks]] of the [[Dnieper]]. After the annexation of the Ukraine, Stepan, one of the family, served as [[sotnik]] (a superior Cossack officer) under General Count [[Rumiantsev|Rumianzoff]], and having distinguished himself at the storming of the Turkish fortress of [[Ochakiv|Otshakoff]], was by ukase of [[Catherine II]] created a noble...</blockquote>

Nicholas' father, Mykola Myklukha, graduated from the Nizhyn Lyceum ([[Nizhyn]]), after which he walked all the way to [[Saint Petersburg]], where he enrolled in the Roadway Institute of Engineering Corps.<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> He graduated from the institute in 1840 and became an engineer assigned to work on the construction of the [[Moscow–Saint Petersburg Railway]].<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> After becoming the first chief of the [[Moskovsky railway station (Saint Petersburg)|Moskovsky passenger railway station]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Myklukha moved his family there.<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> He died in December 1857 from [[tuberculosis]] and was survived by his wife and five children.<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> Before his death, Myklukha was fired from his job for sending 150 rubles to [[Taras Shevchenko]].<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/>

Nicholas' mother, Ekaterina Semenovna, née Bekker, was of [[Germans|German]] and [[Poles|Polish]] descent (her three brothers took part in the [[January Uprising]] of 1863). After 1873, the Miklouho-Maclay family purchased and lived in a country estate in [[Malyn]], {{convert|100|km|mi}} northwest of [[Kiev]] in the [[Polesia]] region.<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/>

One of Nicholas' brothers, Sergei,<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> became a judge in Malyn where he eventually died. Another brother, [[:ru:Миклуха, Михаил Николаевич|Mikhail]],<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> became a geologist. A third brother, [[:ru:Миклуха, Владимир Николаевич|Vladimir]],<ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> was a captain of the [[Russian coast defense ship Admiral Ushakov]] and participated in the [[Battle of Tsushima]] where he perished. Both Mikhail and Vladimir were members of the Russian revolutionary organization [[Narodnaya Volya]].

Nicholas was baptised on 21&nbsp;July 1846 by priest Ioann Smirnov at the Shegrinskaya Church of Nikolaos the Wonderworker. His godfather was Nicholas Ridigier, a Borovichi landowner who was a veteran of the [[Patriotic War of 1812]] and a participant in the [[Battle of Borodino]].

== Education and studies ==

[[File:Ernst Haeckel and von Miclucho-Maclay 1866.jpg|thumb|[[Ernst Haeckel]] with his assistant, Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay, in the Canary Islands, 1866]]
In 1858 Nicholas enrolled into the third grade of a German Lutheran school at the Saint Anna Kirche in Saint Petersburg. During his studies at [[the Second Saint Petersburg Gymnasium]] (1859–1863) along with his brother Sergei, he was arrested and kept for several days in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for participating in student protests. The young students were saved by the Russian writer [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]] who was a friend of Nicholas' father. In 1863, without finishing the gymnasium, Nicholas enrolled as a free listener at the [[St. Petersburg University]] but only spent two months there before being expelled in February 1864 and debarred from tertiary education in Imperial Russia for "breaking the [[norm (social)|rules]]".<ref name="Webster" /><ref name="Ukrainian Fleet"/> In March of the same year, with a forged passport, he moved abroad to complete his studies in German universities, which provided an opportunity to study and work with leading European scientists. He studied humanities at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], medicine at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], and zoology at the [[University of Jena]], where he came under the influence of the great German scholar [[Ernst Haeckel]], who had a profound influence on his future.<ref name="Polynesian" />

Miklouho-Maclay's brilliant student records attracted the attention of Haeckel, who made him his assistant as part of a field expedition to the [[Canary Islands]] in 1866. There, Miklouho-Maclay took an interest in sharks and [[sponge]]s and discovered a new sponge species, which he named ''[[Clathrina blanca|Guancha blanca]]'', in tribute to the [[Guanches]], the original [[Berber people|Berber]] inhabitants of the [[Canary Islands]].<ref name="Wongar"/> He also became a close friend of the biologist [[Anton Dohrn]], with whom he helped conceive the idea of [[research station]]s while staying with him at [[Messina]], Italy.<ref name="Webster" />

== Australia ==

Miklouho-Maclay left St Petersburg for Australia on the [[steam frigate|steam corvette]] ''[[Vityaz (ship)|Vityaz]]''. He arrived in [[Sydney]] on 18&nbsp;July 1878. A few days after arriving, he approached the [[Linnean Society]] and offered to organise a zoological centre. In September 1878 his offer was approved. The centre, known as the ''Marine Biological Station'', was constructed by prominent Sydney architect, John Kirkpatrick. This facility, located in [[Watsons Bay]] on the east side of Greater Sydney, was the first marine biological research institute in Australia.<ref name="mbs">{{cite web|url=http://www.aussieheritage.com.au/listings/nsw/Watsons%20Bay/MarineBiologicalStationformer/5744|title=Marine Biological Station (former)|work=aussieheritage.com.au|date=30 January 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727231812/http://www.aussieheritage.com.au/listings/nsw/Watsons%20Bay/MarineBiologicalStationformer/5744|archive-date=27 July 2008}}</ref> He married Margaret-Emma, widowed daughter of the [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[John Robertson (New South Wales Premier)|John Robertson]].<ref name=MM>{{cite journal|last1=R.

== Anthropological work in New Guinea and the Pacific ==

Miklouho-Maclay lived in northeastern [[New Guinea]] for a two-year period in between 1871 and 1880, from which he also visited the [[Philippines]], [[Malay Peninsula]] and Australia on a number of occasions. He returned to New Guinea again in 1883.<ref name =Quanchi>{{cite book | last = Quanchi | first = Max| year = 2005 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands | publisher = The Scarecrow Press  |page=183| isbn = 0810853957}}</ref> Living amongst the native tribes, his comprehensive treatise on their way of life and customs was invaluable to later researchers.<ref name=MM/>

== Anthropological views ==

In scientific and anthropological circles during the 1850s and 1860s there was much discussion connected with the study of [[Race (classification of human beings)|human races]] and the interpretation of racial peculiarities. There were some anthropologists, such as [[Samuel George Morton|Samuel Morton]], who tried to prove that not all human races were of equal worth, and that "[[white people]]" were predestined by "[[natural selection]]" to rule over the "[[black people|coloured]]" races.<ref name="Turmarkin">Turmarkin, D. "Miklouho-Maclay" in ''Rain'', the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 51 (Aug., 1982), pp. 4-7</ref>

Some scientists, such as Ernst Haeckel, a teacher of the young Miklouho-Maclay, relegated what they regarded as culturally "backward" people like [[Papuan people|Papuans]], [[Bushmen]] and others to the role of '[[transitional fossil|intermediate links]]' between Europeans and their animal ancestors. While adhering to [[Darwin's theory of evolution]], Miklouho-Maclay diverged from these concepts, and it was this question that led him to gather scientific facts and to study the dark-skinned inhabitants of New Guinea. On the basis of his [[comparative anatomy|comparative anatomical]] research, Miklouho-Maclay was one of the first anthropologists to refute [[polygenism]], the view that the different races of mankind belonged to different [[species]].<ref name="Shnukal" /><ref name="Turmarkin" />

{{Quotation|You were the first to demonstrate beyond question by your experience that man is man everywhere, that is, a kind, sociable being with whom communication can and should be established through kindness and truth, not guns and spirits. I do not know what contribution your collections and discoveries will make to the science for which you serve, but your experience of contacting the primitive peoples will make an epoch in the science for which I serve i.e. the science which teaches how human beings should live with one another.|[[Leo Tolstoy]]|to N.

== Opposition to slavery ==

The humanist views of Miklouho-Maclay led him to campaign actively against the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] and against [[blackbirding]]&nbsp;– carried on between the islands of Melanesia and plantations in [[Queensland]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]] and [[New Caledonia]].<ref name="Webster" /> In November 1878 the Dutch government informed him that on his recommendations it was checking the slave traffic at [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]]. From 1879 onwards he wrote a number of letters to Australian papers, and corresponded with [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Sir Arthur Gordon]], [[High Commissioner]] for the Western Pacific, on protecting the [[land law|land rights]] of his friends on the Maclay Coast of north-eastern New Guinea, and on ending the traffic in [[weapons|arms]] and [[psychoactive drug|intoxicants]] in the South Pacific.<ref name="BCM">

== Ill-health and death in Russia ==

In 1887 he left Australia and returned to St Petersburg to present his work to the Imperial [[Russian Geographical Society]], taking his young family with him. Miklouho-Maclay was in poor health<ref name=Allam>{{cite web|last1=Allam|first1=Lorena|title=Remembering Nikolai|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/hindsight/remembering-nikolai/4923276|website=ABC Radio National|publisher=Hindsight|access-date=6 February 2015|date=15 September 2013}}</ref> and, despite treatment from [[Sergei Botkin]], Miklouho-Maclay died of an undiagnosed [[brain tumour]], aged 41, in St Petersburg. He was buried in the [[Volkovo Cemetery]], and left his skull to the St Petersburg Military and Medical Academy.

== Post-death ==

Miklouho-Maclay's widow returned to Sydney with their children. Until 1917 the scientist's family received an imperial Russian pension. The money was first allocated by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and then by [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. One of his sons, Alexander, married a daughter of [[Richard O'Connor (politician)|R. E. O'Connor]]. His travel journals were not published until 1923, and an annotated five-volume collection of his works was published in 1953.<ref name=Quanchi/>

The Marine Biological Station in Watson's Bay, built and used by Miklouho-Maclay, was commandeered by the Ministry of Defence in 1899 as a [[barracks]] for [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s. In the 1980s the Miklouho-Maclay Society unsuccessfully lobbied for the centre to be made into a historical landmark in memory of Miklouho-Maclay's scientific work. Today, although owned by the [[Sydney Harbour Federation Trust]], the building is used as a private residence and is only open to the public on special occasions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.harbourtrust.gov.au/visit/marine-biological-station | title=Marine Biological Station | publisher=Sydney Harbour Federation Trust | access-date=29 July 2013}}</ref>

A monument to Miklouho-Maclay was unveiled in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], on 3 March 2011.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
The term ''Maclay Coast'' has from time to time been used to refer the North-east coast of [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Maclay+Coast,+Papua+New+Guinea&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=38.554089,53.525391&ie=UTF8&z=7&iwloc=A Maclay Coast, Papua New Guinea] on Google Maps.</ref> Miklouho-Maclay began using the term, defining it as extending for 150 miles between [[Sumkar District|Cape Croisilles]] and [[Tawae-Siassi District|Cape King William]], and 30–50 miles inland to the mountains of Mana-Boro-Boro ([[Finisterre Range|Finisterre Mountains]]).<ref name="BCM" /><ref>Maclay, N. de Miklouho, 1885. — "Notes on Zoology of the Maclay Coast in New Guinea", in ''Proc.

The section of the coast from Cape Croisilles to Madang is referred to as part of the North Coast, the bay in which Madang is situated in called [[Astrolabe Bay]], while the coast from [[Astrolabe Bay]] to [[Saidor]] is the Rai Coast, which in turn gives its name to [[Rai Coast District]], an electorate returning an MP to the [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea]].

In [[Madang]], Papua New Guinea&nbsp;– not far from where the explorer stayed in the 1870s&nbsp;– a street has been named after him.<ref>Ogloblin (1998), p. 487.</ref>
