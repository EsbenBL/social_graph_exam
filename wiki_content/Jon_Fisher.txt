==Prediction of 2010 US unemployment peak==
Fisher is known for making accurate predictions about the U.S. economy, particularly [[unemployment rates]].<ref name="Unemploymentheaded1">{{cite web|url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/career-management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208700381|title=I Hope I'm Wrong About Rising Unemployment|author=Greg MacSweeney|date=June 18, 2010|accessdate=October 22, 2010|publisher=Wall street & Technology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206014352/http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/career-management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208700381|archive-date=December 6, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Nicole Ferraro">{{cite web|url=http://www.internetevolution.com/author.asp?section_id=466&doc_id=189367|publisher = Internet Evolution|title=2011 to Bring 'Next Economic Catastrophe'|author=Nicole Ferraro|date=March 18, 2010|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}</ref> Fisher has commented that the drop in [[housing starts]] is a good indicator of the direction the [[unemployment rate]] is headed. He writes: "Historically, when new U.S. housing starts have plunged, unemployment has surged in the following year", concluding that he believes a linear correlation exists between national housing starts and national unemployment in times of severe recession.<ref name="Unemploymentheaded1"/> In April 2008 at [[Marquette University]], he predicted U.S. unemployment would rise to 9% by April 2009.<ref name="Nicole Ferraro"/><ref name="Unemploymentheaded">[http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/operations/drop-in-housing-starts-indicates-unemployment-is-headed-to-9-/d/d-id/1259567 Drop in Housing Starts Indicates Unemployment Is Headed to 9%]</ref>

On Nov. 8, 2008, Fisher stated on [[National Public Radio]] that higher unemployment wouldn't increase foreclosures because there weren't many homeowners left who couldn't pay their mortgages, even without a job—although he thought they might not buy as many vehicles and other large purchases.<ref>[http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/11/07/jobs/ NPR jobs]</ref>
