'''The Institute of Commonwealth Studies''', founded in 1949, is the only postgraduate academic institution in the United Kingdom devoted to the study of [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]].  It is also home to the longest-running interdisciplinary and practice-oriented human rights MA programme in the UK.

The institute is a national and international centre of excellence for policy-relevant research, research facilitation and teaching.  As a member of the School of Advanced Study, established in 1994, the institute works with nine other prestigious postgraduate research institutes to offer academic opportunities across and between a wide range of subject fields in the humanities and social sciences.

The institute's library is an international resource holding more than 190,000 volumes, with particularly impressive Caribbean, Southern African and Australian holdings and over 200 archival collections.
