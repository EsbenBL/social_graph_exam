'''Reinhard Justus Reginald Selten'''  ({{IPA-de|ˈʁaɪ̯nhaʁt ˈzɛltn̩|lang|De-Reinhard Selten.ogg}}; 5 October 1930&nbsp;– 23 August 2016) was a German [[economics|economist]], who won the 1994 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (shared with [[John Harsanyi]] and [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]]). He is also well known for his work in [[bounded rationality]] and can be considered one of the founding fathers of [[experimental economics]].

== Biography ==
Selten was born in [[Wrocław|Breslau (Wrocław)]] in [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]], now in [[Poland]], to a [[Jewish]] father, Adolf Selten (blind bookseller; d. 1942<ref name=nytobit>Roberts, Sam, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/business/economy/reinhard-selten-whose-strides-in-game-theory-led-to-a-nobel-dies-at-85.html "Reinhard Selten, Whose Strides in Game Theory Led to a Nobel, Dies at 85"], New York ''Times'', September 2, 2016.

The Nobel Prizes 1994, Editor Tore Frängsmyr, [Nobel Foundation&#93;, Stockholm, 1995]</ref> Reinhard Selten was raised as Protestant.<ref name="nobelprize.org"/>

After a brief family exile in Saxony and Austria, Selten returned to Hesse, Germany after the war and, in high school, read an article in [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine about game theory by the business writer [[John D. McDonald]]. He recalled later, he would occupy his "mind with problems of elementary geometry and algebra" while walking back and forth to school during that time.<ref name=nytobit/><ref name=mcs/> He studied mathematics at [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] and obtained his diploma in 1957. He then worked as scientific assistant to Heinz Sauermann until 1967. In 1959, he married with Elisabeth Langreiner. They had no children. In 1961, he also received his doctorate in Frankfurt in mathematics with a thesis on the evaluation of n-person games.

He was a visiting professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and taught from 1969 to 1972 at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and, from 1972 to 1984, at the [[University of Bielefeld]]. He then accepted a professorship at the [[University of Bonn]]. There he built the BonnEconLab, a laboratory for experimental economic research, where he was active even after his retirement.

Selten was professor emeritus at the [[University of Bonn]], Germany, and held several honorary doctoral degrees. He had been an [[Esperantist]] since 1959<ref name="nobelprize.org"/> and met his wife through the Esperanto movement.<ref>Lins, Ulrich & Ertl, István. "Intervjuo kun Reinhard Selten, Nobelpreemiito" ''Esperanto'' (n° 1065-12, December 1994, p. 203</ref> He was a member and co-founder of the [[Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino|International Academy of Sciences San Marino]].

For the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament election]], he was the top candidate for the German wing of [[Europe – Democracy – Esperanto]].<ref>[http://e-d-e.org/-DE-Germanio- Eŭropo – Demokratio – Esperanto: Germanio]</ref>

== Work ==
For his work in [[game theory]], Selten won the 1994 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (shared with [[John Harsanyi]] and [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]]). Selten was Germany's first and, at the time of his death, only Nobel winner for economics.<ref name=nytobit/>

He is also well known for his work in [[bounded rationality]], and can be considered one of the founding fathers of [[experimental economics]]. With [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] he edited the book ''Bounded Rationality: The Adaptive Toolbox'' (2001). He developed an example of a game called Selten's Horse because of its extensive form representation. His last work was "Impulse Balance Theory and its Extension by an Additional Criterion".

He is noted for his publishing in non-refereed journals to avoid being forced to make unwanted changes to his work.<ref>Frey, Bruno S., [https://www.bsfrey.ch/articles/388_03.pdf "Publishing as prostitution? – Choosing between one's own ideas and academic success"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316235039/http://www.bsfrey.ch/articles/388_03.pdf |date=2016-03-16 }}, ''bsfrey.ch'' p. 215 (11).</ref>
