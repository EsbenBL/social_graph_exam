{{short description|Percent of variation in IQ scores in a given population associated with genetic variation}}
Research on the '''heritability of IQ''' inquires into the proportion of [[variance]] in [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] that is attributable to [[genetic variation]] within a population. [[Heritability]], in this sense, is a mathematical estimate of how much of a trait's variation within a population can be attributed to genetic variation between individuals in that population.<ref name="rose">{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Steven P R |title=Commentary: Heritability estimates—long past their sell-by date |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |date=June 2006 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=525–527 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl064 |pmid=16645027 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There has been significant controversy in the academic community about the heritability of IQ since research on the issue began in the late nineteenth century.<ref name=devlin/> [[Intelligence]] in the normal range is a [[Quantitative trait locus#Quantitative traits|polygenic trait]], meaning that it is influenced by more than one gene,<ref>Alice Marcus. 2010.

== Heritability and caveats ==
{{Main|Heritability}}

"Heritability" is defined as the proportion of [[variance]] in a trait which is attributable to genetic variation within a defined population in a specific environment.<ref name="rose"/> Heritability takes a value ranging from 0 to 1; a heritability of 1 indicates that all variation in the trait in question is genetic in origin and a heritability of 0 indicates that ''none'' of the variation is genetic. The determination of many traits can be considered primarily [[genetics|genetic]] under similar environmental backgrounds. For example, a 2006 study found that adult height has a heritability estimated at 0.80 when looking only at the height variation within families where the environment should be very similar.<ref name=identity>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020041 |title=Assumption-Free Estimation of Heritability from Genome-Wide Identity-by-Descent Sharing between Full Siblings |year=2006 |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter M. |last2=Medland |first2=Sarah E. |author-link2=Sarah Medland |last3=Ferreira |first3=Manuel A.

For example, a [[twin study]] on the heritability of depression in men calculated it as 0.29, while it was 0.42 for women in the same study.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.109 |title=A Swedish National Twin Study of Lifetime Major Depression |year=2006 |last1=Kendler |first1=K.

=== Caveats ===
There are a number of points to consider when interpreting heritability:
* Heritability measures the proportion of ''variation'' in a trait that can be attributed to genes, and not the proportion of a trait caused by genes. Thus, if the environment relevant to a given trait changes in a way that affects all members of the population equally, the mean value of the trait will change without any change in its heritability (because the variation or differences among individuals in the population will stay the same). This has evidently happened for height: the heritability of stature is high, but average heights continue to increase.<ref name="unknown">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77 |title=Intelligence: Knowns and unknowns |year=1996 |last1=Neisser |first1=Ulric |last2=Boodoo |first2=Gwyneth |last3=Bouchard |first3=Thomas J., Jr. |last4=Boykin |first4=A.

* A common error is to assume that a heritability figure is necessarily unchangeable. The value of heritability can change if the impact of environment (or of genes) in the population is substantially altered.<ref name="unknown"/> If the environmental variation encountered by different individuals increases, then the heritability figure would decrease. On the other hand, if everyone had the same environment, then heritability would be 100%. The population in developing nations often has more diverse environments than in developed nations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} This would mean that heritability figures would be lower in developing nations. Another example is [[phenylketonuria]] which previously caused mental retardation for everyone who had this genetic disorder and thus had a heritability of 100%. Today, this can be prevented by following a modified diet, resulting in a lowered heritability.
* A high heritability of a trait does not mean that environmental effects such as learning are not involved. Vocabulary size, for example, is very substantially heritable (and highly correlated with general intelligence) although every word in an individual's vocabulary is learned. In a society in which plenty of words are available in everyone's environment, especially for individuals who are motivated to seek them out, the number of words that individuals actually learn depends to a considerable extent on their genetic predispositions and thus heritability is high.<ref name="unknown"/>
* Since heritability increases during childhood and adolescence, and even increases greatly between 16–20 years of age and adulthood, one should be cautious drawing conclusions regarding the role of genetics and environment from studies where the participants are not followed until they are adults. Furthermore, there may be differences regarding the effects on the ''[[g factor (psychometrics)|g-factor]]'' and on non-g factors, with ''g'' possibly being harder to affect and environmental interventions disproportionately affecting non-''g'' factors.<ref name=RJ2010>{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1874350101003010009 |title=Race and IQ: A Theory-Based Review of the Research in Richard Nisbett's Intelligence and How to Get It |year=2010 |last1=Rushton |first1=J. Philippe |last2=Jensen |first2=Arthur R. |journal=The Open Psychology Journal |volume=3 |pages=9–35|doi-access=free }}</ref>
* Polygenic traits often appear less heritable at the extremes. A heritable trait is definitionally more likely to appear in the offspring of two parents high in that trait than in the offspring of two randomly selected parents. However, the more extreme the expression of the trait in the parents, the less likely the child is to display the same extreme as the parents. At the same time, the more extreme the expression of the trait in the parents, the more likely the child is to express the trait at all. For example, the child of two extremely tall parents is likely to be taller than the average person (displaying the trait), but unlikely to be taller than the two parents (displaying the trait at the same extreme).

== Estimates ==
Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the [[United States]].<ref name="unknown"/><ref name="stable" /><ref name="BibcodeSciBCitationhas">{{cite journal |bibcode=1990Sci...250..223B |title=Sources of Human Psychological Differences: The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart |last1=Bouchard |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Lykken |first2=David T. |last3=McGue |first3=Matthew |last4=Segal |first4=Nancy L. |last5=Tellegen |first5=Auke |volume=250 |year=1990 |pages=223–8 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.2218526 |pmid=2218526 |issue=4978|citeseerx=10.1.1.225.1769 }}</ref> It may seem reasonable to expect that genetic influences on traits like IQ should become less important as one gains experiences with age.

A 1994 article in ''Behavior Genetics'' based on a study of Swedish monozygotic and dizygotic twins found the heritability of the sample to be as high as 0.80 in general cognitive ability; however, it also varies by trait, with 0.60 for verbal tests, 0.50 for spatial and speed-of-processing tests, and 0.40 for memory tests. In contrast, studies of other populations estimate an average heritability of 0.50 for general cognitive ability.<ref name=stable>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01067188 |title=Variability and stability in cognitive abilities are largely genetic later in life |year=1994 |last1=Plomin |first1=R. |last2=Pedersen |first2=N.

In 2006, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed about three quarters as a figure held by the majority of studies.<ref name=kirp/>

=== Shared family environment ===
{{See also|Environment and intelligence}}
There are some family effects on the IQ of children, accounting for up to a quarter of the variance. However, adoption studies show that by adulthood adoptive siblings aren't more similar in IQ than strangers,<ref name="PMIDCitationhas">{{cite journal |pmid=9549239 |year=1998 |last1=Bouchard Jr |first1=TJ |title=Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=257–79 |journal=Human Biology}}</ref> while adult full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.24. However, some studies of twins reared apart (e.g. Bouchard, 1990) find a significant shared environmental influence, of at least 10% going into late adulthood.<ref name="BibcodeSciBCitationhas" /> [[Judith Rich Harris]] suggests that this might be due to biasing assumptions in the methodology of the classical twin and adoption studies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Judith Rich |title=No Two Alike|url=https://archive.org/details/notwoalikehumann00harr |url-access=registration |year=2006|isbn=9780393059489 }}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}</ref>

There are aspects of environments that family members have in common (for example, characteristics of the home). This shared family environment accounts for 0.25-0.35 of the variation in IQ in childhood. By late adolescence it is quite low (zero in some studies). There is a similar effect for several other psychological traits. These studies have not looked into the effects of extreme environments such as in abusive families.<ref name="unknown"/><ref name="PMIDCitationhas" /><ref name="Plomin0103">{{cite journal |pmid=11320676 |year=2001 |last1=Plomin |first1=R |last2=Asbury |first2=K |last3=Dunn |first3=J |title=Why are children in the same family so different?

The [[American Psychological Association]]'s report "[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]" (1996) states that there is no doubt that normal [[child development]] requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Severely deprived, neglectful, or abusive environments must have negative effects on a great many aspects of development, including intellectual aspects. Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family experience is in serious dispute. There is no doubt that such variables as resources of the home and parents' use of language are correlated with children's IQ scores, but such correlations may be mediated by genetic as well as (or instead of) environmental factors. But how much of that variance in IQ results from differences between families, as contrasted with the varying experiences of different children in the same family? Recent twin and adoption studies suggest that while the effect of the shared family environment is substantial in early childhood, it becomes quite small by late adolescence. These findings suggest that differences in the life styles of families whatever their importance may be for many aspects of children's lives make little long-term difference for the skills measured by intelligence tests.

=== Non-shared family environment and environment outside the family ===
Although parents treat their children differently, such differential treatment explains only a small amount of non-shared environmental influence. One suggestion is that children react differently to the same environment due to different genes. More likely influences may be the impact of peers and other experiences outside the family.<ref name="unknown"/><ref name="Plomin0103"/> For example, siblings grown up in the same household may have different friends and teachers and even contract different illnesses. This factor may be one of the reasons why IQ score correlations between siblings decreases as they get older.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel |first2=Daniel |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel |last3=Wegner |title=Psychology |url=https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha |url-access=registration |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2010 |page=[https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha/page/408 408] |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}</ref>

Certain single-gene [[metabolic disorder]]s can severely affect intelligence.

=== Heritability and socioeconomic status ===
The APA report "Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns" (1996) also stated that: <blockquote>
"We should note, however, that [[Poverty|low-income]] and non-white families are poorly represented in existing adoption studies as well as in most twin samples. Thus it is not yet clear whether these studies apply to the population as a whole. It remains possible that, across the full range of income and ethnicity, between-family differences have more lasting consequences for psychometric intelligence."<ref name="unknown"/>
</blockquote>

A study (1999) by Capron and Duyme of [[France|French]] children adopted between the ages of four and six examined the influence of [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). The children's IQs initially averaged 77, putting them near retardation. Most were abused or neglected as infants, then shunted from one foster home or institution to the next. Nine years later after adoption, when they were on average 14 years old, they retook the IQ tests, and all of them did better. The amount they improved was directly related to the adopting family's socioeconomic status. "Children adopted by farmers and laborers had average IQ scores of 85.5; those placed with [[Middle class|middle-class]] families had average scores of 92. The average IQ scores of youngsters placed in well-to-do homes climbed more than 20 points, to 98."<ref name=kirp>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/magazine/23wwln_idealab.html?ei=5090&en=2c93740d624fe47f&ex=1311307200&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all|title=After the Bell Curve|access-date=August 6, 2006

[[Michael Stoolmiller|Stoolmiller]] (1999) argued that the range of environments in previous adoption studies was restricted. Adopting families tend to be more similar on, for example, socio-economic status than the general population, which suggests a possible underestimation of the role of the shared family environment in previous studies. Corrections for range restriction to adoption studies indicated that socio-economic status could account for as much as 50% of the variance in IQ.<ref name="Stoolmiller99">{{cite journal |last1=Stoolmiller |first1=Mike |author-link=Michael Stoolmiller |title=Implications of the restricted range of family environments for estimates of heritability and nonshared environment in behavior-genetic adoption studies |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=125 |issue=4 |pages=392–409 |year=1999 |pmid=10414224 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.4.392}}</ref>

On the other hand, the effect of this was examined by [[Matt McGue]] and colleagues (2007), who wrote that "restriction in range in parent disinhibitory psychopathology and family socio-economic status had no effect on adoptive-sibling correlations [in] IQ"<ref name="McGue">{{cite journal |last1=McGue |first1=Matt |last2=Keyes |first2=Margaret |last3=Sharma |first3=Anu |last4=Elkins |first4=Irene |last5=Legrand |first5=Lisa |last6=Johnson |first6=Wendy |last7=Iacono |first7=William G. |title=The Environments of Adopted and Non-adopted Youth: Evidence on Range Restriction From the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS) |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=l449–462 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s10519-007-9142-7 |pmid=17279339|s2cid=15575737 }}</ref>

[[Eric Turkheimer|Turkheimer]] and colleagues (2003) argued that the proportions of IQ variance attributable to genes and environment vary with socioeconomic status. They found that in a study on seven-year-old twins, in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in early childhood IQ was accounted for by the shared family environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse.<ref name = "Turkheimer2003">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x |title=Socioeconomic status modifies heritability of iq in young children |year=2003 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric |author-link=Eric Turkheimer | last2=Haley |first2=Andreana |last3=Waldron |first3=Mary |last4=d'Onofrio |first4=Brian |last5=Gottesman |first5=Irving I. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=623–8 |pmid=14629696|s2cid=11265284 }}</ref>

In contrast to Turkheimer (2003), a study by Nagoshi and Johnson (2005) concluded that the heritability of IQ did not vary as a function of parental socioeconomic status in the 949 families of Caucasian and 400 families of Japanese ancestry who took part in the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0021932004007023 |title=Socioeconomic Status Does Not Moderate the Familiality of Cognitive Abilities in the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition |year=2004 |last1=Nagoshi |first1=Craig T. |last2=Johnson |first2=Ronald C. |journal=Journal of Biosocial Science |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=773–81 |pmid=16221325|s2cid=608104 }}</ref>

Asbury and colleagues (2005) studied the effect of environmental risk factors on verbal and non-verbal ability in a nationally representative sample of 4-year-old British twins.

[[Paige Harden|Harden]], Turkheimer, and [[John C.

In the course of a substantial review, [[J.

A 2011 study by [[Elliot Tucker-Drob|Tucker-Drob]] and colleagues reported that at age 2, genes accounted for approximately 50% of the variation in mental ability for children being raised in high socioeconomic status families, but genes accounted for negligible variation in mental ability for children being raised in low socioeconomic status families. This gene–environment interaction was not apparent at age 10 months, suggesting that the effect emerges over the course of early development.<ref name="Tucker-Drob2011">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797610392926 |title=Emergence of a Gene x Socioeconomic Status Interaction on Infant Mental Ability Between 10 Months and 2 Years |year=2010 |last1=Tucker-Drob |first1=E.

A 2012 study based on a representative sample of twins from the [[United Kingdom]], with longitudinal data on IQ from age two to age fourteen, did not find evidence for lower heritability in low-SES families. However, the study indicated that the effects of shared family environment on IQ were generally greater in low-SES families than in high-SES families, resulting in greater variance in IQ in low-SES families. The authors noted that previous research had produced inconsistent results on whether or not SES moderates the heritability of IQ. They suggested three explanations for the inconsistency. First, some studies may have lacked statistical power to detect interactions. Second, the age range investigated has varied between studies. Third, the effect of SES may vary in different demographics and different countries.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030320 |title=Socioeconomic Status (SES) and Children's Intelligence (IQ): In a UK-Representative Sample SES Moderates the Environmental, Not Genetic, Effect on IQ |year=2012 |editor1-last=Scott |editor1-first=James G |last1=Hanscombe |first1=Ken B. |last2=Trzaskowski |first2=Maciej |last3=Haworth |first3=Claire M.

=== Maternal (fetal) environment ===

A [[meta-analysis]] by Devlin and colleagues (1997) of 212 previous studies evaluated an alternative model for environmental influence and found that it fits the data better than the 'family-environments' model commonly used. The shared maternal ([[fetal]]) environment effects, often assumed to be negligible, account for 20% of covariance between twins and 5% between siblings, and the effects of genes are correspondingly reduced, with two measures of heritability being less than 50%. They argue that the shared maternal environment may explain the striking correlation between the IQs of twins, especially those of adult twins that were reared apart.<ref name=devlin>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/41319 |year=1997 |last1=Devlin |first1=B. |last2=Daniels |first2=Michael |last3=Roeder |first3=Kathryn|author3-link= Kathryn Roeder |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6641 |pages=468–71 |pmid=9242404 |title=The heritability of IQ|bibcode=1997Natur.388..468D |s2cid=4313884 |doi-access=free }}</ref> IQ heritability increases during early childhood, but whether it stabilizes thereafter remains unclear.<ref name="devlin" />{{Oldfact|date=November 2015}} These results have two implications: a new model may be required regarding the influence of genes and environment on cognitive function; and interventions aimed at improving the prenatal environment could lead to a significant boost in the population's IQ.<ref name="devlin" />

Bouchard and McGue reviewed the literature in 2003, arguing that Devlin's conclusions about the magnitude of heritability is not substantially different from previous reports and that their conclusions regarding prenatal effects stands in contradiction to many previous reports.<ref name=pmid12486697>{{cite journal |last1=Bouchard |first1=Thomas J. |last2=McGue |first2=Matt |title=Genetic and environmental influences on human psychological differences |journal=Journal of Neurobiology |date=January 2003 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=4–45 |doi=10.1002/neu.10160 |pmid=12486697 |doi-access=free }}</ref> They write that: <blockquote>Chipuer et al. and Loehlin conclude that the postnatal rather than the prenatal environment is most important. The Devlin et al. (1997a) conclusion that the prenatal environment contributes to twin IQ similarity is especially remarkable given the existence of an extensive empirical literature on prenatal effects. Price (1950), in a comprehensive review published over 50 years ago, argued that almost all MZ twin prenatal effects produced differences rather than similarities. As of 1950 the literature on the topic was so large that the entire bibliography was not published. It was finally published in 1978 with an additional 260 references. At that time Price reiterated his earlier conclusion (Price, 1978). Research subsequent to the 1978 review largely reinforces Price’s hypothesis (Bryan, 1993; Macdonald et al., 1993; Hall and Lopez-Rangel, 1996; see also Martin et al., 1997, box 2; Machin, 1996).<ref name="pmid12486697"/></blockquote>

=== Dickens and Flynn model ===

Dickens and Flynn (2001) argued that the "heritability" figure includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects where the genotype changes the environment, in turn affecting IQ. That is, those with a higher IQ tend to seek out stimulating environments that further increase IQ. The direct effect can initially have been very small but [[feedback]] loops can create large differences in IQ. In their model an environmental stimulus can have a very large effect on IQ, even in adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues. This model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition in early childhood, that may cause permanent effects.

The [[Flynn effect]] is the increase in average intelligence test scores by about 0.3% annually, resulting in the average person today scoring 15 points higher in IQ compared to the generation 50 years ago.<ref name = Schacter409>{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel |first2=Daniel |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel |last3=Wegner |title=Psychology |url=https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha |url-access=registration |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2010 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha/page/409 409–10] |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}</ref> This effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that programs aiming to increase IQ would be most likely to produce long-term IQ gains if they taught children how to replicate outside the program the kinds of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains while they are in the program and motivate them to persist in that replication long after they have left the program.<ref name="DickensFlynn2001">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346 |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |year=2001 |last1=Dickens |first1=William T. |last2=Flynn |first2=James R. |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346–69 |pmid=11381833|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dickens |first1=William T. |last2=Flynn |first2=James R. |title=The IQ paradox is still resolved: Reply to Loehlin (2002) and Rowe and Rodgers (2002). |journal=Psychological Review |date=2002 |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=764–771 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 }}</ref>
Most of the improvements have allowed for better abstract reasoning, spatial relations, and comprehension. Some scientists have suggested that such enhancements are due to better nutrition, better parenting and schooling, as well as exclusion of the least intelligent people from reproduction. However, Flynn and a group of other scientists share the viewpoint that modern life implies solving many abstract problems which leads to a rise in their IQ scores.<ref name = Schacter409/>

=== Influence of genes on IQ stability ===

Recent research has illuminated genetic factors underlying IQ stability and change.

A novel molecular genetic method for estimating heritability calculates the overall genetic similarity (as indexed by the cumulative effects of all genotyped [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s) between all pairs of individuals in a sample of unrelated individuals and then correlates this genetic similarity with phenotypic similarity across all the pairs. A study using this method estimated that the lower bounds for the narrow-sense heritability of crystallized and fluid intelligence are 40% and 51%, respectively. A replication study in an independent sample confirmed these results, reporting a heritability estimate of 47%.<ref name=Davies2011/> These findings are compatible with the view that a large number of genes, each with only a small effect, contribute to differences in intelligence.<ref name="Chabris"/>

== Correlations between IQ and degree of genetic relatedness ==
The relative influence of genetics and environment for a trait can be calculated by measuring how strongly traits [[covary]] in people of a given genetic (unrelated, siblings, fraternal twins, or identical twins) and environmental (reared in the same family or not) relationship. One method is to consider [[identical twin]]s reared apart, with any similarities that exist between such twin pairs attributed to genotype. In terms of [[correlation]] statistics, this means that theoretically the correlation of tests scores between [[monozygotic]] twins would be 1.00 if genetics alone accounted for variation in IQ scores; likewise, siblings and [[dizygotic]] twins share on average half [[allele]]s and the correlation of their scores would be 0.50 if IQ were affected by genes alone (or greater if there is a positive correlation between the IQs of spouses in the parental generation).<!--This is because if there is such a correlation, then there will be a positive correlation between the alleles in the father of the siblings for any given locus, and similarly for the mother, and therefore the difference between the siblings in the contribution of a parent will be less than otherwise. (Though this could be criticized as "original research", it is true, and therefore the sentence above is only true if qualified by the parenthesis I added. If the parenthesis is removed, the whole sentence should also be removed as not really true.)--> Practically, however, the [[upper bound]] of these correlations are given by the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the test, which is 0.90 to 0.95 for typical IQ tests<ref>Jensen, Arthur (1998). The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger Publishers{{page needed|date=April 2013}}</ref>

If there is [[biological inheritance]] of IQ, then the relatives of a person with a high IQ should exhibit a comparably high IQ with a much higher probability than the general population. In 1982, Bouchard and McGue reviewed such correlations reported in 111 original studies in the United States. The mean correlation of IQ scores between monozygotic twins was 0.86, between siblings 0.47, between half-siblings 0.31, and between cousins 0.15.<ref name="pmid7195071">{{cite journal |bibcode=1981Sci...212.1055B |title=Familial Studies of Intelligence: A Review |last1=Bouchard |first1=Thomas J. |last2=McGue |first2=Matthew |volume=212 |year=1981 |pages=1055–9 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.7195071 |pmid=7195071 |issue=4498}}</ref>

The 2006 edition of ''Assessing adolescent and adult intelligence'' by [[Alan S. Kaufman]] and Elizabeth O. Lichtenberger reports correlations of 0.86 for identical twins raised together compared to 0.76 for those raised apart and 0.47 for siblings.<ref name="KaufmanLichtenberger2006">{{cite book |title=Assessing Adolescent and Adult Intelligence |last1=Kaufman |first1=Alan S. |last2=Lichtenberger |first2=Elizabeth |author-link1=Alan S.

When comparing pre-1963 to late 1970s data, researches DeFries and Plomin found that the IQ correlation between parent and child living together fell significantly, from 0.50 to 0.35. The opposite occurred for fraternal twins.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0160-2896(80)90003-3 |title=Genetics and intelligence: Recent data |year=1980 |last1=Plomin |first1=Robert |last2=Defries |first2=J.C. |journal=Intelligence |volume=4 |pages=15–24}}</ref>

Every one of these studies presented next contains estimates of only two of the three factors which are relevant. The three factors are G, E, and GxE. Since there is no possibility of studying equal environments in a manner comparable to using identical twins for equal genetics, the GxE factor can not be isolated. Thus the estimates are actually of G+GxE and E. Although this may seem like nonsense, it is justified by the unstated assumption that GxE=0. It is also the case that the values shown below are r correlations and not r(squared), proportions of variance. Numbers less than one are smaller when squared. The next to last number in the list below refers to less than 5% shared variance between a parent and child living apart.

In favor of an environmental explanation, on the other hand, numerous studies and reviews have shown promising results. Among these, some focus on the gradual closing of the black–white IQ gap over the last decades of the 20th century, as black test-takers increased their average scores relative to white test-takers. For instance, Vincent reported in 1991 that the black–white IQ gap was decreasing among children, but that it was remaining constant among adults.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Ken R.|date=March 1991|title=Black/white IQ differences: Does age make the difference?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-4679(199103)47:2%3C266::AID-JCLP2270470213%3E3.0.CO;2-S|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=47|issue=2|pages=266–270|doi=10.1002/1097-4679(199103)47:2<266::AID-JCLP2270470213>3.0.CO;2-S|pmid=2030133|via=}}</ref> Similarly, a 2006 study by Dickens and Flynn estimated that the difference between mean scores of black people and white people closed by about 5 or 6 IQ points between 1972 and 2002, a reduction of about one-third.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last=Dickens|first=William T.|date=2006|title=Black Americans Reduce the Racial IQ Gap: Evidence from Standardization Samples|url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20060619_IQ.pdf|journal=Psychological Science|volume=17|issue=10|pages=913–20|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01802.x|pmid=17100793|s2cid=6593169|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924083050/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20060619_IQ.pdf|archive-date=2009-09-24|via=}}</ref> In the same period, the educational achievement disparity also diminished.<ref>Neisser, Ulric (Ed). 1998.
