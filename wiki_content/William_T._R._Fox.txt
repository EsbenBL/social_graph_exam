'''William Thornton Rickert Fox''' (January 12, 1912 – October 24, 1988), generally known as '''William T. R. Fox''' (or occasionally '''W. T. R. Fox'''), was an American [[foreign policy]] professor and [[international relations]] theoretician at the [[Columbia University]] (1950–1980, [[emeritus]] 1980–1988). He is perhaps mostly known as the coiner of the term "[[superpower]]" in 1944. He wrote several books about the [[foreign policy of the United States]] of America and the [[United Kingdom]] (and its predecessor: the [[British Empire]]). He was a pioneer in establishing international relations, and the systematic study of statecraft and war, as a major academic discipline. National security policy and an examination of civil-military relations were also focuses of his interests and career. He was the founding director of Columbia's [[Institute of War and Peace Studies]] and held the position from 1951–1976.

==Early life and early career==
Fox was born and grew up in [[Chicago]].<ref name="whos-84"/><ref name="nyt-obit"/>  He attended [[Haverford College]], graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a B.S. in 1932.<ref name="whos-84">{{cite book | title=Who's Who in America 1984–1985 Volume 1 | edition=43rd | publisher=[[Marquis Who's Who]] | location=Chicago | year=1984 | page=1086}}</ref><ref name="ps-inmem"/>

He then obtained his masters and Ph.D. degrees at the [[University of Chicago]],<ref name="nyt-obit"/> in 1934 and 1940, respectively.<ref name="whos-84"/>  There he was among a group of students, which also included [[V. O. Key, Jr.]] and [[David Truman]], who studied with the pioneering political scientist [[Charles E. Merriam]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19621022-01.2.4&srpos=10&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-%22william+t.+r.+fox%22-----# | title=Man in the News | first=Andrew B. |last=Schultz | newspaper=[[Columbia Daily Spectator]] | date=October 22, 1962 | page=1}}</ref>  He also studied [[international law]] under [[Quincy Wright]].<ref name="preface-essay"/>  [[Harold Lasswell]] and his approach towards political analysis <!-- which was exactly what? unclear to me --> was the biggest influence on Fox there.<ref name="preface-essay"/>

He married [[Annette Baker Fox|Annette Baker]] in 1935,<ref name="whos-84"/> who also became a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and an international relations scholar.  They had two children together and sometimes collaborated on academic work as well.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>

[[Image:Superpower map 1945.png|300px|thumb|A world map of 1945. According to William T.R. Fox, the United States (blue), the Soviet Union (red), and the British Empire (turquoise) were superpowers.]]

Fox initially taught as an instructor at [[Temple University]] from 1936–41 and [[Princeton University]] from 1941–43.<ref name="whos-84"/> He joined [[Yale University]] in 1943 and became an associate professor there in 1946.<ref name="whos-84"/>  He was associate director of the [[Yale Institute of International Studies]] from 1943 to 1950.<ref name="hanson-essay"/>  The director there, [[Frederick S. Dunn]] – who held that international relations was "politics in the absence of central authority" – was another important influence on Fox.<ref name="preface-essay"/>

Fox coined the word "superpower" in his 1944 book ''The Super-Powers: The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union – Their Responsibility for Peace'' to identify a new category of power able to occupy the highest status in a world in which, as the war then raging demonstrated, states could challenge and fight each other on a global scale. According to him, there were (at that moment) three states that were superpowers: the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[British Empire]].  The book forecast the directions that Soviet-American relations would take if the powers did not collaborate, but also made an effort to explore feasible opportunities that leaders might have to forestall that future.  Fox was part of the international staff at the 1945 [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]], the San Francisco meeting that led to the creation of the [[United Nations Charter]].<ref name="nyt-obit"/>  He was one of the contributors to [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]]'s landmark 1946 volume ''The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order'', where he recognized with Brodie that the future nuclear stand-off between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. would become focused on the fear of mutual destruction, but in his portion explored ways that international agreements to limit or control nuclear weapons might improve matters.  Fox came away from his activities during this period convinced that the framing of international relations theory should be around the proposition that, "If man is to have the opportunity to exercise some measure of rational control over his destiny, the limits of the possible and the consequences of the desirable both have to be investigated."<ref name="guilhot-app4">{{cite book | title=The Invention of International Relations Theory: Realism, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the 1954 Conference on Theory | editor-first=Nicolas | editor-last=Guilhot | publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] | location=New York | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-231-15267-9 | pages=273–275 | first=William T.

==Columbia years and organizational positions==
Fox joined the Columbia faculty as a full professor in 1950.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>  Later, he became the James T. Shotwell Professor of International Relations from 1968–72, the Bryce Professor of the History of International Relations from 1972–80, and Bryce Professor Emeritus after that.<ref name="cur-obit"/>

Upon the request of [[List of Presidents of Columbia University|President of Columbia]] [[Dwight D.

Fox often spent time abroad as a scholar, including in England in 1955, as a [[Fulbright Lecturer]] at the [[Rio Branco Institute]] and [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil in 1966, in Mexico in 1967, and as a visiting research fellow at [[Australian National University]] in 1968 and 1979.<ref name="whos-84"/><ref name="nyt-obit"/><ref name="preface-essay"/>  In addition, he was a visiting professor at [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa in 1971,<ref name="nyt-obit"/> as well as the Claude T.

Long interested in issues surrounding [[NATO]], Fox and his wife [[Annette Baker Fox]] published ''NATO and the Range of American Choice'' in 1967, which analyzed the range of reactions to the evolution of NATO and the American role within it.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/179882249/?terms=%22william%2Bt.%2Br.%2Bfox%22%2Bnato | title=Critical Look at NATO Pact and the Role of Super-Powers | first=Harold J. | last=Wiegand | newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer | date=March 1, 1967 | page=41 | via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>  Fox also worked on behalf of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], addressing issues related to the security of Western Europe.  In a 1967 address to the one of the [[World Affairs Councils of America]], Fox said that NATO "seems superfluous because it is working ... it is in part a victim of its own success."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/142280983/?terms=%22william%2Bt.%2Br.%2Bfox%22%2B%22arms%2Bcontrol%2Band%2Bdisarmament%22 | title=More Public Support Urged for Halting Nuclear Spread | newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date=May 10, 1967 | page=3C | via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

During his career, Fox described himself as a "[[Meliorism|pragmatic meliorist]]" who believed in the possibility of improving how international relations were conducted and in highlighting the normative meanings of domestic and world policies.<ref name="rothstein-essay"/>  Former colleague and dean [[David Truman]] later said, "He was an impressive scholar with a tremendous range. He was interested in the whole political scene, not just international relations, and was always full of ideas about how to do things better."<ref name="cur-obit"/>  One of his longtime courses at Columbia was called "Systematic World Politics"; as it evolved, its reading list gave more space to issues such as [[imperialism]], [[International inequality]], and [[Sustainability|limited global resources]], but always focused at the end upon the range of choices for future world orders.<ref>Syllabi for Political Science G6801x, Systematic World Politics, Winter Session 1971–72 and Fall Semester 1979.</ref>  Towards the end of his career at Columbia, he developed an explicit focus on moral concerns and human rights, giving courses such as "Means and Ends in International Relations" and "Human Rights and U.S. Foreign Policy".

He was the first managing editor of the journal ''[[World Politics]]'', a position he held from 1948 to 1953.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> Under his guidance it became the preeminent journal in its field, and his system of commissioning review articles for it endured past his time there.<ref name="ps-inmem">{{cite journal | journal=[[PS Political Science & Politics]] | title=In Memoriam: William T.

Fox was president of the [[International Studies Association]] (ISA) in 1972–73.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.isanet.org/ISA/Governance/President/PastPresidents.aspx | title=Presidents of ISA | publisher=[[International Studies Association]] | access-date=January 10, 2014}}</ref>  In addition, he was a former vice president of the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref name="nyt-obit"/>   He also chaired a committee for research on national security policy in the [[Social Science Research Council]] from 1953 to 1964.<ref name="nyt-obit"/><ref name="whos-84"/>  The conferences it sponsored under Fox's guidance aided the development of the field and gave those starting in the field as sense of intellectual community.  Fox was also a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name="nyt-obit"/>

Fox and his wife were residents of the [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside neighborhood]] of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] for four decades and he was active in the First Congregational Church of Old Greenwich.<ref name="cur-obit"/>  He died at [[Greenwich Hospital (Connecticut)|Greenwich Hospital]] of heart disease on October 24, 1988, having suffered a heart attack and been hospitalized two months earlier.<ref name="cur-obit">{{cite news | title = Obituaries...

==Legacy==
In 1991, ''The Evolution of Theory in International Relations'', a Festschrift-like collection of essays in honor of William T. R. Fox, was published, many of which had been featured in the special Spring/Summer 1990 issue of ''[[Journal of International Affairs]]''.  Edited by Robert L. Rothstein, it featured contributions from [[Kenneth N. Waltz]], [[Robert Jervis]], [[Glenn H. Snyder]], [[Louis Henkin]], [[Ernst B. Haas]], and others, as well as a preface from his wife, [[Annette Baker Fox]].  In her essay, Professor Elizabeth C. Hanson said that, "Bill Fox helped to shape international relations as a major academic field and to demonstrate the relevance of its theoretical investigations to policy making."<ref name="hanson-essay">{{cite book | title=The Evolution of Theory in International Relations | editor-first=Robert L. | editor-last=Rothstein | publisher=[[University of South Carolina Press]] | location=Columbia, South Carolina | year=1991 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMZvXYuDxUsC&pg=PA1 | pages=1–20 | first=Elizabeth C. | last=Hanson | chapter=William T.

Scores of students who participated in his seminars now fill high academic or policy-making positions."<ref name="hanson-essay"/>  Many of the [[Great Debates (international relations)|"Great Debates" in international relations theory]] happened during this era. But Fox's non-dogmatic approach meant there was a wide range of intellectual diversity and scholarly approach among his students and mentees.<ref name="rothstein-essay">{{cite book | title=The Evolution of Theory in International Relations | editor-first=Robert L. | editor-last=Rothstein | publisher=[[University of South Carolina Press]] | location=Columbia, South Carolina | year=1991 | pages=xi–xviii | first=Robert L. | last=Rothstein | chapter=The Evolution of the Theoretical Debate }}</ref>

In other settings, the scholar Lucja Swiatkowski Cannon wrote that Fox "was a U.S. pioneer in establishing the systematic study of statecraft and war as an academic discipline."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web | url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/your_columbians/william_fox.html <!-- Bot generated title --> |title=Columbia250: William T.R.
