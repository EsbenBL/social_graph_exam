[[File:JustinYifuLin hiswife Bookfair2009.jpg|thumb|Justin Yifu Lin and his wife at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair|Frankfurt Book Fair 2009]]]]
In 1976 Lin entered the MBA program at [[National Chengchi University]] in [[Taiwan]] on a defense scholarship and returned to the army upon receiving his MBA in 1978. As a captain in the [[Republic of China Army]] in [[Taiwan]], he defected to Mainland China on May 17, 1979, from the island of [[Kinmen]] off the coast of [[Fujian province|Fujian]] to the nearby island of [[Xiamen]] of Mainland China. Lin left his pregnant wife and his three-year-old child in Taiwan; a year after he defected, he was declared "missing" by the ROC Army and his wife claimed the equivalent of US$31,000 from the government.<ref name=standard>Jennifer Chou: [http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/02/world_banks_chief_economist_is.asp World Bank's Chief Economist Swam to China?], ''The Weekly Standard'', February 11, 2008</ref> His wife and their children joined him years later when both of them went to study in the United States.<ref name=tpt2002>{{cite news | title=Justin Lin's wife pays her respects | date=2002-06-04 | url =http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2002/06/04/138877 | work =Taipei Times | access-date = 2008-01-22 }}</ref> While an officer in the ROC Army, Lin was held up as a model soldier; after his desertion, the ROC originally listed him as missing but in 2000 issued an order for his arrest on charges of defection.<ref>{{cite news | title=World Bank economist risks arrest if he visits | date=2008-02-07 | url =http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/02/07/2003400523 | work =Taipei Times | access-date = 2008-02-07 }}</ref>

In a letter written to his family in Taiwan about a year after his defection, Lin stated that "based on my cultural, historical, political, economic and military understanding, it is my belief that returning to the motherland is a historical inevitability; it is also the optimal choice."<ref name=standard/><ref>{{cite web|title=给表兄李建兴的信 (A letter to elder cousin Jianxing Li) |url=http://www.aisixiang.com/data/36667.html|work=Published on Oct-18-2010|publisher=爱思想网(http://www.aisixiang.com)|author=林毅夫 (Justin Yifu Lin)|location=Beijing, China|year=1980|language=zh}}</ref> A [[National Taiwan University]] alumnus {{ill|Hongsheng Zheng|zh|鄭鴻生}} confirmed Lin's reason and motive.<ref name="鄭鴻生 Zheng">{{cite journal|title=青年林正義之路 (The Road Taken by Youth Zhengyi Lin)|journal=文化研究月報 (Monthly Cultural Studies) |date=June 15, 2002|series=三角公園 (Triangle Park) |issue=16 |url=http://hermes.hrc.ntu.edu.tw/csa/journal/16/journal_park110.htm|author=鄭鴻生 (Zheng, Hongsheng)|publisher=中華民國文化研究學會 (Cultural Studies Association of ROC)|location=Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China|language=zh}}</ref> Lin's oldest brother said it was unfair to brand his younger brother a traitor.

His 2012 book, ''The Quest for Prosperity: How Developing Economies Can Take Off'', argued for an active role for government in nurturing development, not just through the traditional provision of infrastructure and legal enforcement, but also by identifying and actively supporting industries that contribute to growth.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Lin |first= Justin Yifu  |year= 2012 |title= The Quest for Prosperity: How Developing Economies Can Take Off Justin Yifu Lin |location= Princeton,&nbsp;NJ |publisher= Princeton University Press |isbn= 978-0-691-15589-0 }}</ref>
