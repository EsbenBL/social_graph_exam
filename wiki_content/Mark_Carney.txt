==Career==
===Goldman Sachs===
Carney spent 13 years at [[Goldman Sachs]]<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Peter S.

In 2003, Carney left Goldman Sachs to join the [[Bank of Canada]] as a deputy governor.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} One year later, he was recruited to join the [[Department of Finance Canada]] as [[Deputy minister (Canada)|senior associate deputy minister]], beginning that role on November 15, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=October 21, 2004|title=Deputy Governor Mark Carney appointed Senior Associate Deputy Minister of Finance|format=press release|location=Ottawa|publisher=Bank of Canada|url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2004/10/deputy-governor-mark-carney-appointed-senior-associate-deputy-minister-of-finance|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref>

===Department of Finance===
From November 2004 to October 2007, Carney was the senior associate deputy minister and [[G7]] deputy at the Finance Canada. He served under two [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|finance ministers]]: [[Ralph Goodale]], a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and [[Jim Flaherty]], a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]]. During this time Carney oversaw the [[Government of Canada]]'s controversial plan to tax [[Income trust#The Conservatives propose new rules for income trusts|income trusts]] at source.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Willis|first1=Andrew|last2=Grant|first2=Tavia|last3=Scoffield|first3= Heather|date=October 4, 2007|title=Playing a new game, in a new arena|format=business news report|journal=[[The Globe and Mail]]|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/playing-a-new-game-in-a-new-arena/article1083525|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Carney was also the lead on the federal government's profitable sale of its 19 percent stake in [[Petro-Canada]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-governor-gets-his-hands-dirty/article1264733/page2/|title=The governor gets his hands dirty|work=theglobeandmail.com|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=October 4, 2007|title=Key facts on Mark Carney, next Bank of Canada chief|publisher=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-bank-carney-idUSN0430674220071004|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref>

===Governor of the Bank of Canada===
In November 2007, it was announced that Carney would be appointed [[Governor of the Bank of Canada]]. He immediately left his position at the Department of Finance to serve as an advisor to the outgoing governor, [[David A. Dodge|David Dodge]], before formally assuming Dodge's position on 1 February 2008.<ref name="07-27">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=October 4, 2007|title=Mark Carney Appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada|format=press release|location=Ottawa|publisher=Bank of Canada|url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2007/10/press-releases/mark-carney-appointed-governor-bank-canada|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Carney was selected over [[Paul Jenkins (economist)|Paul Jenkins]], the senior deputy governor, who had been considered the front-runner to succeed Dodge.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/paul-jenkins-leaving-bank-of-canada/article1344099|location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|first=David|last=Parkinson|title=Paul Jenkins leaving Bank of Canada|date=October 29, 2009}}</ref>

Carney took on this role at the beginning of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 global financial crisis]]. At the time of his appointment, Carney was the youngest [[central bank]] [[governor]] among the [[G8]] and [[G20]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Vieira|first=Paul|title=Carney vaults over heir apparent for Bank of Canada top job|work=[[National Post]]|date=October 4, 2007|url=http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=4e6b4073-de51-4ab2-b79c-626e93627b45&k=8869|access-date=January 4, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520082801/http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=4e6b4073-de51-4ab2-b79c-626e93627b45&k=8869|archive-date=May 20, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Financial crisis====
Carney's actions as Governor of the Bank of Canada are said to have played a major role in helping Canada avoid the worst impacts of the financial crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3Dnewsarchive%26sid%3DaQcJ7bw4QH.Y|title=Carney Shows How Canada Controls Risk So Central Banks Can Too|access-date=February 12, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629011213/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aQcJ7bw4QH.Y|archive-date=June 29, 2011|last1=Quinn|first1=Greg|last2=Argitis|first2=Theophilos|work=Bloomberg News|date=November 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/mark-carney-interesting-times-1.990186|title=Mark Carney: Interesting times|author=Hornbrook, Mike|date=January 29, 2011|work=cbc.ca|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref>

The epoch-making feature of his tenure as Governor remains the decision to cut the overnight rate by 50 [[basis point]]s in March 2008, only one month after his appointment. While the [[European Central Bank]] delivered a rate increase in July 2008, Carney anticipated the leveraged-loan crisis would trigger global [[Financial contagion|contagion]]. When policy rates in Canada hit the effective lower-bound, the central bank combatted the crisis with the [[Monetary policy|non-standard monetary tool]]: "conditional commitment" in April 2009 to hold the policy rate for at least one year, in a boost to domestic credit conditions and market confidence. Output and employment began to recover from mid-2009, in part thanks to monetary stimulus.<ref name=VermaEuromoney12>{{cite journal|author=Verma, Sid|year=2012|title=Mark Carney: Finance's new statesman|journal=[[Euromoney]]|issue=October|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b12kjh4fnwcdss/mark-carney-finances-new-statesman|access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref> The Canadian economy outperformed those of its G7 peers during the crisis, and Canada was the first G7 nation to have both its [[GDP|Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) and employment recover to pre-crisis levels.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Canada's [[Risk aversion|risk-averse]] fiscal and regulatory environment is also cited as a factor. In 2009 a ''[[Newsweek]]'' columnist wrote, "Canada has done more than survive this financial crisis. The country is positively thriving in it. Canadian banks are well capitalized and poised to take advantage of opportunities that American and European banks cannot seize."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Zakaria, Fareed|date=February 16, 2009|title=Worthwhile Canadian Initiative|url=http://www.newsweek.com/zakaria-canadian-solution-82535?piano_t=1|format=print, online perspective|language=en|journal=[[Newsweek]]|location=New York|pages=B1, B4–5|access-date=June 24, 2016|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

Carney earned various accolades for his leadership during the financial crisis: he was named one of ''[[Financial Times]]'' 's "Fifty who will frame the way forward",<ref>{{cite journal|author=Staff|date=March 10, 2009|title=Fifty who will frame a way forward|journal=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2fe0826a-0dac-11de-a10d-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz19dDhjnDA|access-date=June 24, 2016|url-access=subscription }}</ref> and of ''[[Time Magazine]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s ''2010 Time 100''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984864_1985417,00.html|title=The 2010 TIME 100|first=Barbara|last=Kiviat|date=April 29, 2010|access-date=March 16, 2021|via=www.time.com}}</ref> In May 2011, ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' named him "Editor's Choice for Most Trusted Canadian".<ref name=RD01>{{cite web|url=http://www.readersdigest.ca/home-garden/money/one-one-mark-carney|title=One-on-One with Mark Carney|date=April 21, 2011|work=readersdigest.ca|access-date=June 24, 2016|last1=Belluz|first1=Julia}}</ref>

In October 2012, Carney was named "Central Bank Governor of the Year 2012" by the editors of ''[[Euromoney]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Horwood, Clive (Ed.)|date=October 11, 2012|title=Carney named Euromoney Central Bank Governor of the Year 2012|journal=[[Euromoney]]|issue=October|url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3100069/Carney-named-Euromoney-Central-Bank-Governor-of-the-Year-2012.html|access-date=June 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016070515/http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3100069/Carney-named-Euromoney-Central-Bank-Governor-of-the-Year-2012.html|archive-date=October 16, 2012}}</ref>

On 4 November 2011, Carney was named Chairman of the [[Basel]]-based [[Financial Stability Board]].<ref name=":0" /> In a statement, Carney credited his appointment to "the strong reputation of Canada's financial system and the leading role that Canada has played in helping to develop many of the most important international reforms".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Torobin|first=Jeremy|date=2011-11-04|title=New global bank sheriff Mark Carney gets more firepower|language=en-CA|work=The Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/new-global-bank-sheriff-mark-carney-gets-more-firepower/article4085837/|access-date=2021-11-11}}</ref>

The three-year term was a part-time commitment, allowing Carney to complete his term at the Bank of Canada.

On 26 November 2012, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] announced the appointment of Carney as [[Governor of the Bank of England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-gets-his-man-mark-carney-named-as-new-bank-of-england-governor-8352494.html|title=George Osborne gets his man: Mark Carney named as new Bank of England Governor|website=The Independent|date=27 November 2012|access-date=2 April 2020|last=Chu|first=Ben|quote=The panel put forward Mr Carney’s name to the Chancellor, who then consulted the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister before announcing his decision.}}</ref> He succeeded [[Mervyn King (economist)|Sir Mervyn King]] on 1 July 2013.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20501990|title=Mark Carney named new Bank of England governor|author=Peston, Robert|date=November 26, 2012|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref> He was the first non-Briton to be appointed to the role since the [[Bank of England]] was established in 1694.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-03-15|title=Mark Carney: What legacy will he leave the Bank of England?|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51851150|access-date=2021-11-11}}</ref> The Bank of England was given additional powers from 2013, such as the ability to set bank capital requirements.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schumpeter|date=November 26, 2012|title=The Bank of England's new governor: Canada home and dry|journal=[[The Economist]]|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/11/bank-englands-new-governor|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref>

Prior to taking up the post, Carney had already indicated disagreement with the Bank of England's Executive Director of Financial Stability [[Andy Haldane]], specifically on leverage ratios and on bank break-ups. He has been quoted as saying that Haldane does not have a "proper understanding of the facts" on bank regulation.<ref name=VermaEuromoney12/> He was thought to have been offered a total pay package of about [[Pound sterling|£]]624,000 ([[Canadian dollar|$]]990,000) per year, approximately £100,000 ($160,000) more per year than his predecessor.<ref name="bbc"/>

=== Since 2020 ===
Carney was appointed as United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance as he prepared to step down as governor of the Bank of England in March 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/01/un-appoints-mark-carney-to-help-finance-climate-action-goals|title=UN appoints Mark Carney to help finance climate action goals|last=Butler|first=Sarah|date=2019-12-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In January 2020, UK Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] appointed Carney to the position of finance advisor for the UK presidency of the [[COP26]] [[United Nations Climate Change conference]] in Glasgow;<ref>{{Cite news| last = Goodman| first = David| title = U.K.'s Johnson Names Mark Carney as Finance Adviser for COP26| work = Bloomberg| access-date = December 6, 2020| date = January 16, 2020| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-16/u-k-s-johnson-names-mark-carney-as-finance-adviser-for-cop26}}</ref> at that time the conference was scheduled for November 2020 but it was later postponed to November 2021.<ref name="govuk-newdates">{{cite web|date=28 May 2020|title=New dates agreed for COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-dates-agreed-for-cop26-united-nations-climate-change-conference|website=gov.uk}}</ref>

As of October 2020, Carney is vice chairman at Brookfield Asset Management where he leads the firm's [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|environmental, social and governance (ESG)]] and impact fund investment strategy.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Mark Carney joins Brookfield to lead firm's expansion into ESG funds|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|url=https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/carney-joins-brookfield-to-lead-firm-s-expansion-into-esg-funds-1.1485153|last1=Deveau|first1=Scott|last2=Kelly|first2=Jason|date=August 26, 2020|access-date=May 8, 2021}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite news|title=Mark Carney, ex-head of Bank of Canada and Bank of England, joins Brookfield Asset Management|work=CBC News|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/brookfield-carney-1.5700287 |date=August 26, 2020 |access-date=May 8, 2021 |agency=The Canadian Press}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Former central banker Mark Carney joins Brookfield to lead environmental, socially driven investing|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-former-central-banker-mark-carney-joins-brookfield-to-lead/|access-date=2021-01-20|date=August 26, 2020|last1=Willis|first1=Andrew|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> In February 2021 Carney, had to retract an earlier claim that the $600 billion Brookfield Asset Management portfolio was [[carbon neutral]].

==Policy views==

===Risks of increasing wealth inequality===
In December 2016, Carney warned of the societal risk of "staggering wealth [[economic inequality|inequalities]]" in a Roscoe Lecture at [[Liverpool John Moores University]]: "The proportion of the wealth held by the richest 1% of Americans increased from 25% in 1990 to 40% in 2012 ... Globally, the share of wealth held by the richest 1% in the world rose from one-third in 2000 to one-half in 2010."<ref>{{cite web|author=Speech given by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech946.pdf |title=The Spectre of Monetarism |publisher=Bank of England/Liverpool John Moores University |date=5 December 2016 |access-date=2017-06-10}}</ref>

===Brexit===
Carney warned many times that [[Brexit]] was expected to negatively influence the UK economy. Consequently, Brexit activists accused him of making statements favouring the UK's continued membership of the [[European Union]] (EU) before the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|British EU-membership referendum]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mark Carney: EU exit is 'biggest domestic risk'|publisher=BBC News|date=March 8, 2016|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35751919|access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Brexit vote may spark recession, Mark Carney warns|publisher=BBC News|date=May 12, 2016|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36273448|access-date=May 13, 2016|last1=Robertson|first1=Jamie}}</ref> He replied that he felt it was his duty to speak up on such issues.<ref>{{cite news|title=UK Bank governor Carney says is 'duty' to speak of Brexit risks|publisher=BBC News|date=April 19, 2016|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36082255|access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref>

In September 2018, [[Philip Hammond]], the [[chancellor of the Exchequer]], confirmed speculation that Carney would remain as Governor until January 2020, in order to ensure a "smooth" transition after the UK was set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, a departure deadline that was missed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mark Carney willing to stay on as Bank of England governor |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45401638 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=4 September 2018}}</ref>

In November 2018, Carney warned that large parts of the British economy were not ready for a [[no-deal Brexit]]. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today'']] Programme, Carney explained that fewer than half of businesses have initiated contingency plans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46377765|title=UK not ready for no-deal Brexit – Carney|date=2018-11-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In February 2019, speaking about the global economy, Carney provided a less negative perspective on Brexit, stating that globalisation has resulted in "imbalances of democracy and sovereignty", and that Brexit "is the first test of a new global order and could prove the acid test of whether a way can be found to broaden the benefits of openness while enhancing democratic accountability".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/12/mark-carney-brexit-bank-of-england-uk |title=Mark Carney: Brexit is the first test of a new global order |first=Larry |last=Elliott |date=12 February 2019 |publisher=Guardian News & Media Limited |access-date=17 February 2019}}</ref>

===Monetary policy in the 2019 international monetary and financial system===

In his 23 August 2019 speech delivered at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City]]'s 2019 annual [[Jackson Hole Economic Symposium]] at [[Jackson Lake Lodge]], entitled "The Growing Challenges for Monetary Policy in the current International Monetary and Financial System", Carney said that the "widespread use of the US dollar—the dominant currency pricing—in "trade invoicing, in place of the currency of either the producer or the importer"<ref name="voxeu_Brunnermeier_20190703"/> has had a "destablilizing" effect on the global economy, according to ''Reuters''.<ref name="reuters_20190823">{{Cite news| title = World needs to end risky reliance on U.S. dollar: BoE's Carney| work = Reuters|date=24 August 2019 |access-date=24 August 2019| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-jacksonhole-carney-idUSKCN1VD28C}}</ref> About 50 percent of international trade relies on the US dollar as the "currency of choice." This represents "five times greater than the US's share in world goods imports, and three times its share in world exports."<ref name="Carney_20190823"/> Dominant currency pricing is not problematic when there is "synchronised growth" globally, Carney said. When "the tide is rising in America while receding elsewhere", the system needs to be revamped. Carney cited  an article<ref name="voxeu_Brunnermeier_20190703">{{Cite web| last1 = Brunnermeier| first1 = Markus K.| last2 = James| first2 = Harold| last3 = Landau| first3 = Jean-Pierre| title = Digital currency areas| work = Vox EU|access-date=23 August 2019 |date=3 July 2019| url = https://voxeu.org/article/digital-currency-areas}}</ref> by [[Markus K.

Speaking only hours after US President [[Donald Trump]] had posted on Twitter that he blamed [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Jerome Powell]]'s policies creating fears of an economic recession—and then threatened China with more retaliatory tariffs—Carney urged central banks to work together to replace the US dollar as [[reserve currency]]. He cautioned against choosing another new hegemonic reserve currency like the [[Renminbi]] and suggested instead, a "new [[Synthetic Hegemonic Currency]] (SHC), such as [[Libra (cryptocurrency)|Libra]],<ref name="reuters_20190823"/><ref name="Carney_20190823"/><ref name="Bloomberg_News_20190823">{{Cite web| title = Carney Urges Libra-Like Reserve Currency to End Dollar Dominance |work=Bloomberg News|date=August 24, 2019 |access-date=August 24, 2019| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-23/carney-urges-libra-like-reserve-currency-to-end-dollar-dominance |last1=Swint|first1=Brian}}</ref> which could potentially be provided "through a network of central bank digital currencies," that would decrease the US dollar's "domineering influence" on trade worldwide.<ref name="Carney_20190823"/><ref name="Bloomberg_News_20190823"/>

Carney also said that the recent increase in the perception that a no-deal Brexit is likely, is "evidenced by betting odds and financial market asset pricing" resulting in the UK now having "the highest FX implied volatility, the highest equity risk premium and lowest real yields of any advanced economy."<ref name="Carney_20190823"/>

===Climate change===
Carney has taken a leading position on the need for climate action.<ref>{{Cite news|title=COVID-19 pandemic adds urgency to fight against climate change: Mark Carney |language=en-US|work=CBC News|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-carney-pandemic-climate-change-1.5946117|access-date=2021-03-13|date=March 12, 2021}}</ref>

====Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM)====

In 2020, Carney launched the [[Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets]]—an initiative to increase trading of voluntary [[carbon offset]]s—<ref name="FT_20021203">{{cite journal|author=Staff|date=2020|title=Carney calls for '$100bn a year' global carbon offset market|journal=[[Financial Times]]|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8ed608b2-25c8-48d2-9653-c447adbd538f|access-date=December 6, 2020|url-access=subscription }}</ref> with Bill Winters as Group Chief Executive.<ref name="TSVCM_2020">{{Cite web| title = Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM)| access-date = December 6, 2020| url = https://www.iif.com/tsvcm}}</ref> The TSVCM is sponsored by the [[Institute of International Finance]].<ref name="TSVCM_2020"/> Taskforce members include more than "40 leaders from six continents with backgrounds across the carbon market value chain", including representatives from the [[Bank of America]], [[BlackRock]], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'s New Energy Finance, [[BNP Paribas]], [[BP]], [[Boeing]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Tata Steel]], [[Total SE|Total]], [[IHS Markit]], and LSE.<ref name="TSVCM_2020"/> In a December 3, 2020 ''[[Financial Times]]'' article, Carney said that the voluntary global carbon offset market was an "imperative" to help reduce emissions. The ''Times'' article cited Carney saying London would likely be the host of the new "new pilot market for voluntary carbon offsets" which could be "set up" by December 2021.<ref name="FT_20021203"/>

===Moral to market sentiments===
On December 2, 2020 Carney delivered the first of four [[Reith Lectures]]—the BBC's flagship annual series.<ref name="BBC_Carney_20201202">{{Cite episode| title = How We Get What We Value - From Moral to Market Sentiments |first=Mark |last=Carney |series=[[Reith Lectures]] via BBC Sounds| access-date = December 6, 2020 |date=December 2, 2020| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000py8t}}</ref> In "How We Get What We Value - From Moral to Market Sentiments", he said society had come to esteem financial value over human value and moved from market economies to market societies. The series covers a trio of crises—credit, Covid and climate.<ref name="BBC_Carney_20201202"/>
