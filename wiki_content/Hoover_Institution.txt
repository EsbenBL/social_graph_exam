The Hoover Institution has been a place of scholarship for individuals who previously held high-profile positions in government, such as [[George Shultz]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Michael Boskin]], [[Edward Lazear]], [[John B.

==History==
[[File:Hoover-Tower.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]], Stanford University.]]
The Institution was set up by Hoover, a wealthy engineer who was one of Stanford's first graduates. In 1928, he was elected [[President of the United States]]. He had been in charge of major relief efforts in Europe in 1914–1917 in [[Belgium]] and again after the [[First World War|world war]] in central and eastern Europe, especially [[Russia]]. Hoover's plan was to collect and permanently preserve the documents of major events for [[open research]]. Hoover's search team obtained rare printed and unpublished material. They included the papers of activists on the far left and far right, including the files of the ''[[Okhrana]]'' (the [[Tsarist]] secret police).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Duignan |first=Peter |date=2001 |title=The Library of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace. Part 1: Origin and Growth |journal=Library History |volume=17 |pages=3–20 |doi=10.1179/lib.2001.17.1.3 |s2cid=144635878}}</ref> In 1960, {{Q|96318655}} became director. He specialized in fund raising, setting up research operations and building collections regarding China and the Soviet Union. Relations improved with the host university.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Duignan |first=Peter |date=2001 |title=The Library of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace. Part II. The Campbell Years |journal=Library History |volume=17 |pages=107-118}}</ref>

In 1919, Hoover donated $50,000 to Stanford University to support the collection of primary materials related to World War I, a project that became known as the Hoover War Collection. Supported primarily by gifts from private donors, the Hoover War Collection flourished in its early years. In 1922, the Collection became known as the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives|Hoover War Library]]. The Hoover War Library was housed in the [[Stanford Library]], separate from the general stacks. By 1926, the Hoover War Library was known as the largest library in the world devoted to the Great War. By 1929, it contained 1.4 million items and was becoming too large to house in the Stanford Library. In 1938, the War Library revealed building plans for [[Hoover Tower]], which was to be its permanent home independent of the Stanford Library system. The 285-[[Foot (unit)|foot]] tall<ref name="Make A Gift">{{cite web |url=https://www.myscience.org/news/wire/tower_power_hoover_institution_celebrates_100_years_of_ideas_defining_a_free_society-2019-stanford |title=Make A Gift |website=myScience |access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref> tower was completed in 1941, Stanford University's fiftieth anniversary.<ref name="Library and Archives – Historical background">{{cite web |url= http://0055d26.netsolhost.com/hila/history.htm |title= Hoover Institution Library and Archives: Historical Background |website=Hoover Institution}}</ref> Since then, the tower has been a key landmark for campus.<ref name="100 Years of Hoover">{{cite web |url=https://stanfordpolitics.org/2019/05/11/100-years-of-hoover-a-history-of-stanfords-decades-long-debate-over-the-hoover-institution/ |title=100 Years of Hoover: A History of Stanford's Decades-Long Debate over the Hoover Institution |last=Bonafont |first=Roxy |date=11 May 2019 |website=Stanford Political Journal |access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref> On its 14th floor, the tower has an [[observation deck]] which holds a [[carillon]] of 48 bells that were donated to former president Hoover in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/thetake/article/Stanford-s-secrets-Decades-of-surprises-11049494.php |title=Stanford's secrets: Decades of surprises stashed in Hoover Tower |last=Niekerken |first=Bill van |date=4 April 2017 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>

By 1946, the agenda of the Hoover War Library had expanded to include research activities; thus the organization was renamed the Hoover Institution and Library on War, Revolution and Peace. At this time, [[Herbert Hoover]] was living in [[New York City]] but remained integrally involved in the Hoover Institution and Library as a benefactor, fundraiser, and consultant.

In 1956 former President Hoover, under the auspices of the Institution and Library, launched a major fundraising campaign that allowed the Institution to realize its current form as a think tank and archive. In 1957, the Hoover Institution and Library was renamed the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace—the name it holds today.<ref name="About Herbert Hoover and the Hoover Institution">{{cite web |url= http://www.hoover.org/about/timeline |title= Hoover Institution – Hoover Institution Timeline |work= hoover.org}}</ref>

In 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably. Despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanford.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Duignan |first=Peter |date=2001 |title=The Library of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace. Part 2: The Campbell Years |journal=Library History |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=107–118 |doi=10.1179/lib.2001.17.2.107 |s2cid=144451652}}</ref>

In 1975 [[Ronald Reagan]], who was [[Governor of California]] at that time, was designated as Hoovers first honorary fellow. He donated his gubernatorial papers to the Hoover library.<ref name="csmonitor">{{cite web |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0327/032756.html |title=Hoover Institution; Leaning to the right |last=McBride |first=Stewart |date=27 March 1980 |website=The Christian Science Monitor |access-date=17 July 2019}}</ref> During that time the Hoover Institution held a general budget of $3.5 million a year. In 1976, one third of Stanford University's book holdings were housed at the Hoover library. At that time, it was the largest private archive collection in the United States.<ref name="100 Years of Hoover" />

Until 1979, Hoover's annual budget was about $5.7 million, of which about forty percent was used to fund research (more than four times as much as twenty years ago).<ref name="100 Years of Hoover" /> For his presidential campaign in 1980, Reagan engaged at least thirteen Hoover scholars to support the campaign in multiple capacities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-stanford-hoover-debate-still-rages/ |title=At Stanford, Hoover Debate Still Rages |last=Fitzgerald |first=Patrick |date=1 February 2008 |website=CBS News |access-date=17 July 2019}}</ref> After Reagan won the election campaign, more than thirty current or former Hoover Institution fellows worked for the Reagan administration in 1981.<ref name="100 Years of Hoover" />

In 1989, Campbell retired as director of Hoover. He was replaced by John Raisian. This change of personnel was seen as the end of an era.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stanfordmag.org/contents/the-man-behind-the-institution |title=The Man Behind the Institution |date=April 2002 |website=Stanford Magazine |access-date=18 July 2019}}</ref>

[[John Raisian]] served as director from 1989 to 2015. [[Thomas W. Gilligan]] succeeded him in 2015. [[Condoleezza Rice]] succeeded him in 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.stanford.edu/2020/01/28/condoleezza-rice-lead-stanfords-hoover-institution/ |title=Condoleezza Rice to lead Stanford's Hoover Institution |date=28 January 2020 |website=Stanford News |access-date=2 February 2020}}</ref>

In August 2017 the David and Joan Traitel Building was inaugurated. The ground floor is a large conference center with a 400-seat [[auditorium]] and the top floor houses the Hoover Institution's headquarters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://degenkolb.com/projects/stanford-university-hoover-institute-traitel-building/ |title=Stanford University, Hoover Institute, David and Joan Traitel Building |website=Degenkolb |access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref> The auditorium is now a symbolic bridge between Hoover and Stanford Campus. In the future,{{when|date=September 2020}} Traitel will be joined by the [[George Shultz]] Building.<ref name="Make A Gift" />

In 2019 the Hoover Institution celebrated its centenary. Hoover has 65 Senior Fellows, 45 Research Fellows, 26 Senior Guest Fellows, 6 National Fellows and 8 National Security Fellows. They are an interdisciplinary group of humanists, political scientists studying education, economics, foreign policy, energy, history, law, national security, health and politics.<ref name="Make A Gift" />

The Institution has libraries which include materials from both the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]], including the collection of documents of President Hoover, which he began to collect at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/thetake/article/Stanford-s-secrets-Decades-of-surprises-11049494.php |title=Stanford's secrets: Decades of surprises stashed in Hoover Tower |last=Niekerken |first=Bill van |date=4 April 2017 |website=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref> Thousands of [[Persian language|Persian]] books, official documents, letters, multimedia pieces and other materials on [[Iran]]'s history, politics and culture can also be found at the Stanford University library and the Hoover Institution library.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.radiofarda.com/a/Stanford-Libraries-Hoover-Institution-archival-materials-on-Iran/28480566.html |title=Spotlight On Iran |date=11 May 2017 |website=Radio Farda |access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref>

During the Trump administration, the Hoover Institution had close relations with the administration. Multiple Hoover Institution affiliates filled top positions in the administration. These included [[Scott Atlas]], a radiologist who pushed for policies contrary to the recommendations of the scientific community in relation to the coronavirus pandemic,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kelly|first=Kate|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|date=2020-10-14|title=As Virus Spread Early On, Reports of Trump Administration Briefings Fueled Sell-Off|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-investors.html|access-date=2020-10-15|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and whose actions in this regard were condemned by the faculty senate at Stanford.<ref>{{cite news|title=Faculty Senate condemns COVID-19 actions of Hoover’s Scott Atlas|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2020/11/20/faculty-senate-condemns-actions-hoover-fellow-scott-atlas/|author=Chesley, Kate|date=November 20, 2020|access-date=November 26, 2020|publisher=Stanford News (Stanford University)}}</ref>
