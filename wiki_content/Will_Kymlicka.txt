==Education and career==
Kymlicka received his [[B.A.]] (Honours) in [[philosophy]] and [[political studies]] from [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] in 1984, and his [[D.Phil.]] in philosophy from [[Oxford University]] in 1987, under the direction of [[G.

==Thought==
{{original research|section|date=June 2020}}
One of his main concerns throughout his work is providing a [[Liberalism|liberal]] framework for the just treatment of minority groups, which he divides into two basic categories: polyethnic or immigrant groups, and national minorities (such as the Canadian [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]], or the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]]). He lists criteria for national minorities or "minority nations":
# present at founding;
# prior history of self-government;
# common culture;
# common language;
# governing selves through institutions.
By these criteria, the two "minority nations" in Canada are the [[Indigenous peoples in Canada]] and the Québécois.  Kymlicka argues that such minority groups deserve unique rights from the state by the nature of their unique role and history within the national population.

Polyethnic groups are less deserving of such rights since they come to the state voluntarily and thus have some degree of responsibility to [[social integration|integrate]] to the norms of their new nation. This does not mean that they are not entitled to any rights as Kymlicka argues that all cultural minorities have a right to choose their own lives, but it does mean that they are not entitled to the same level of group rights which minority nations would be entitled to. Kymlicka makes various exceptions such as the problems faced by refugees, whether from conflict or poverty, and by such minority groups such as African-Americans (whose heritage in America clearly did not begin voluntarily) and argues that their needs with regards to cultural group-specific rights should be considered on a special basis.

In ''Multicultural Citizenship'' (1995), Kymlicka argues that group-specific rights are consistent with liberalism, and are particularly appropriate, if not outright demanded, in certain situations. He defines three such group-specific rights: special group representation rights (such as affirmative action policies in politics); self-government rights; and polyethnic rights (such as the policy exempting [[Sikh]]s from having to wear motorcycle helmets).

A distinction that Kymlicka draws, which is crucial to his liberal defence of group-specific rights for minorities, is between external protection and internal restrictions. Kymlicka argues that external protections between groups may be justified in order to promote equality (but they must not allow for oppression or exploitation, as in [[apartheid]] in South Africa). Internal restrictions, however, cannot be justified from a liberal perspective, insofar as they restrict a person's autonomy, though they may be granted in certain cases to national minorities.

[[Brian Barry]] argues that Kymlicka's views are not liberal at all, in the sense that they are not universalist in nature and that they allow for cultural relativism. Barry further accuses Kymlicka of posing a false choice between liberalism as autonomy and liberalism as tolerance, further asserting that claims for cultural rights and for equality of treatment are incompatible.<ref>Brian Barry, ''Culture and Equality'' (Polity Press, 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-7456-6564-1}}</ref> Young Kim provides an interesting comparison of their two views on multiculturalism and the limits of liberalism.<ref>Young Kim, [https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498516518/Justice-as-Right-Actions-An-Original-Theory-of-Justice-in-Conversation-with-Major-Contemporary-Accounts Justice as Right Actions: An Original Theory of Justice in Conversation with Major Contemporary Accounts] ([[Rowman & Littlefield|Lexington Books]], 2015, {{ISBN|978-1-4985-1651-8}}).</ref>

===Human rights===
The standard liberal criticism, which states that group rights are problematic because they often treat individuals as mere carriers of group identities, rather than autonomous social agents, is overstated or oversimplified. The actual problem of minorities and how they should be viewed in liberal democracies is much more complex. There is a distinction between good group rights, bad group rights, and intolerable group rights.
# Bad group rights (internal restrictions) are rules imposed by the group upon intragroup relations. They most often take the form of the group restricting the liberty of individual members in the name of group solidarity. Indigenous groups try to protect themselves from women's movements on the basis that they threaten the social and traditional role of indigenous populations. He contends that may raises the danger of individual oppression. Internal restrictions can be used to uphold violent, dominant, absolutist systems. Legally-imposed internal restrictions are thus bad and almost always unjust, not to mention that they go against liberal ideals.
# Good group rights (external protections) involve intergroup relations. Indigenous groups need protection in terms of their nationals identities by limiting the vulnerability of that group to the decisions of external groups or society. Therefore, they should have the right to their own taxation, health care, education, and governance.

===Animal rights===
The book ''Zoopolis'', by [[Sue Donaldson]] and co-authored with Kymlicka, explores the state of [[animal rights]] for different categories of animals.

Donaldson and Kymlicka believe that [[abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]] is an inadequate response to both the ethical and practical challenges of living fairly and constructively with other animals.

Donaldson and Kymlicka suggest that animals should be characterized through three categories, serving to determine the nature of the laws and politics that should protect those animals. [[Domesticated animal]]s should be given a kind of adjusted co-citizenship in which their best interest and preferences would be taken into account. Donaldson and Kymlicka defend the end of their use, advocating for a [[vegan]] position, but they reject extinctionism with regards to those animals that are currently breed by humans. Wild animals should be granted sovereignty on their land enough so that they can sustain their way of living and prosper. Donaldson and Kymlicka support some moderate forms of intervention to reduce [[wild animal suffering]], and they claim that more significant courses of action should be aiming at keeping wild animals able to lead their lives. "Liminal" animals, those that are not domesticated but live in urban, suburban, or industrial areas (such as mice, pigeons and insects), should be treated as denizens of human communities.<ref>Donaldson, Sue and Kymlicka, Will, 2011.
