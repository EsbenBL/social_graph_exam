Zablocki was a supporter of what he called 'the brainwashing hypothesis'.<ref name="Zablocki1997">{{cite journal |title=The Blacklisting of a Concept: The Strange History of the Brainwashing Conjecture in the Sociology of Religion |journal=Nova Religio |date=October 1997 |first=Benjamin. |last=Zablocki |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=96–121 |doi=10.1525/nr.1997.1.1.96}}</ref> Other scholars, Zablocki noted, commonly mistake [[brainwashing]] for both a recruiting and a retaining process, when it is merely the latter.<ref name="Zablocki 2001 176">{{cite book|last=Zablocki|first=Benjamin|title=Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field|year=2001|publisher=U of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8188-9|pages=176}}</ref> This misunderstanding enables critics of brainwashing to set up a straw-man, and thereby unfairly criticize the phenomenon of [[brainwashing]].<ref name="Zablocki 2001 176" /> For evidence of the existence of brainwashing, Zablocki refers to the sheer number of testimonies from ex-members and even ex-leaders of cults.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zablocki|first=Benjamin|title=Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field|year=2001|publisher=U of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8188-9|pages=194–201}}</ref> Zablocki further alleges that brainwashing has been unfairly "[[blacklisted]]" from the academic journals of sociology of religion. Such blacklisters, Zablocki asserts, receive lavish funding from alleged cults and engage in "corrupt" practices.<ref name="Zablocki1997" />
