'''Richard Whately''' (1 February 1787 – 8 October 1863) was an English academic, rhetorician, logician, philosopher, economist, and theologian who also served as a reforming [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin]]. He was a leading [[Broad Church]]man, a prolific and combative author over a wide range of topics, a flamboyant character, and one of the first reviewers to recognise the talents of [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gary L.

==Life and times==

He was born in London, the son of the Rev. Dr. [[Joseph Whately]] (1730–1797). He was educated at a private school near [[Bristol]], and at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] from 1805. He obtained a B.A. in 1808, with double second-class honours, and the prize for the English essay in 1810; in 1811 he was elected Fellow of Oriel, and in 1814 took [[holy orders]]. After graduation he acted as a private tutor, in particular to [[Nassau William Senior]] who became a close friend, and to [[Samuel Hinds (bishop)|Samuel Hinds]].<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>{{cite ODNB|id=25090|first=Phyllis|last=Deane|title=Senior, Nassau William}}</ref>

===Early married life===
After his marriage to writer [[Elizabeth Whately]] in 1821, Whately lived in Oxford. He had had to give up his college fellowship, which could not be held by married men, and at this period lived by tutoring and his pen.<ref>{{cite book|title=The London Quarterly Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXFAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA477|year=1867|publisher=Epworth Press|page=477}}</ref> An uncle, [[William Plumer (1736–1822)|William Plumer]], presented him with a living, [[Halesworth]] in Suffolk; in August 1822 Whately moved there. Two of his daughters were writer [[Jane Whately]] and missionary [[Mary Louisa Whately]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard Whately|author2=Elizabeth Jane Whately|title=Life and Correspondence of Richard Whately, D.D.: Late Archbishop of Dublin|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeandcorrespo00whatgoog|year=1866|publisher=Longmans, Green|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandcorrespo00whatgoog/page/n64 44]}}</ref> In 1825, he was appointed principal of [[St. Alban Hall]], a position obtained for him by his mentor [[Edward Copleston]], who wanted to raise the notoriously low academic standards at the Hall, which was also a target for expansion by Oriel.<ref name="ODNB"/> Whately returned to Oxford, though giving up only in 1831 the Suffolk living, where he had seen the social effects of unemployment.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stefan Collini|author2=Richard Whatmore|author3=Brian Young|title=Economy, Polity, and Society: British Intellectual History 1750-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuT3zV0jFwEC&pg=PA190|date=22 May 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63978-1|page=190}}</ref>

A reformer, Whately was initially on friendly terms with [[John Henry Newman]]. They fell out over [[Robert Peel]]'s candidacy for the [[Oxford University]] seat in Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/pusey/liddon/1.10.html|title=Life of Edward Bouverie Pusey by Henry Parry Liddon, D.D. London: Longmans, 1894 volume one Chapter X|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> 

In 1829 Whately was elected as [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]] at Oxford in succession to Nassau William Senior. His tenure of office was cut short by his appointment to the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|archbishopric of Dublin]] in 1831. He published only one course of ''Introductory Lectures'' in two editions (1831 & 1832).<ref name="DNB">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Whately, Richard}}</ref>

===Archbishop of Dublin===
Whately's appointment by [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] to the see of Dublin came as a political surprise. The aged [[Henry Bathurst (bishop)|Henry Bathurst]] had turned the post down. The new Whig administration found Whately, well known at [[Holland House, London|Holland House]] and effective in a parliamentary committee appearance speaking on [[tithe]]s, an acceptable option. Behind the scenes [[Thomas Hyde Villiers]] had lobbied [[Denis Le Marchant]] on his behalf, with the Brougham Whigs.<ref>David de Giustino, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3167906 "Finding an Archbishop: The Whigs and Richard Whately in 1831"], ''Church History'', Vol. 64, No. 2 (June., 1995), pp. 218–236. Published by: Cambridge University Press on behalf of the American Society of Church History</ref> The appointment was challenged in the [[House of Lords]], but without success.<ref name="DNB"/>

In Ireland, Whately's bluntness and his lack of a conciliatory manner caused opposition from his own clergy, and from the beginning he gave offence by supporting state endowment of the Catholic clergy. He enforced strict discipline in his diocese; and he published a statement of his views on Sabbath (''Thoughts on the Sabbath'', 1832). He lived in Redesdale House in [[Kilmacud]], just outside Dublin, where he could garden. He was concerned to reform the [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Irish Poor Laws]].<ref name="DNB"/> He considered [[tithe commutation]] essential for the Church.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stefan Collini|author2=Richard Whatmore|author3=Brian Young|title=Economy, Polity, and Society: British Intellectual History 1750-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuT3zV0jFwEC&pg=PA191|date=22 May 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63978-1|page=191}}</ref>

===Irish national education 1831 to 1853===
In 1831 Whately attempted to establish a national and non-sectarian system of education in Ireland, on the basis of common instruction for Protestants and Catholics alike in literary and moral subjects, religious instruction being taken apart. In 1841 Catholic archbishops [[William Crolly]] and [[John MacHale]] debated whether to continue the system, with Crolly who supported Whately gaining papal permission to go on, given some safeguards.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=17528|first=Emmet|last=Larkin|title=Crolly, William}}</ref> In 1852 the scheme broke down, on the opposition of the new Catholic archbishop of Dublin, [[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Paul Cullen]]. Whately felt himself constrained to withdraw from the Education Board the following year.

===Later life===
During the famine years of 1846 and 1847 the archbishop and his family tried to alleviate the miseries of the people.<ref name="DNB"/> On 27 March 1848, Whately became a member of the [[Canterbury Association]].<ref name="blain">{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/nz/blain_canterbury2007.pdf|title=Reverend|last=Blain|first=Michael|year=2007|work=The Canterbury Association (1848–1852): A Study of Its Members' Connections|pages=87|access-date=19 January 2010}}</ref> He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1855.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter W|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterW.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref>

From 1856 onwards symptoms of decline began to manifest themselves in a [[paralysis|paralytic affection]] of Whately's left side. Still he continued his public duties.<ref name="IrishBio"/>

===Death===
[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral South Transept West Aisle Monument Dedicated to Archbishop Richard Whately II 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|Monument dedicated to Richard Whately in the west aisle of the south transept in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], sculpted by [[Thomas Farrell (sculptor)|Sir Thomas Farrell]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine |title=The Buildings of Ireland: Dublin |year=2005 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-10923-8 |page=621}}</ref>]]
In the summer of 1863 Whately was prostrated by an [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]] in the leg, and after several months of acute suffering he died on 8 October 1863.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Works==
Whately was a prolific writer, a successful expositor and Protestant apologist in works that ran to many editions and translations. His ''Elements of Logic'' (1826) was drawn from an article "Logic" in the ''[[Encyclopædia Metropolitana]]''.<ref>Whately, Richard, ''Elements of Logic'', p.vii, Longman, Greens and Co. (9th Edition, London, 1875)</ref> The companion article on "Rhetoric" provided ''Elements of Rhetoric'' (1828).<ref name="DNB"/> In these two works Whately introduced [[erotetic logic]].<ref>Mary Prior and [[Arthur Prior]], "Erotetic Logic", ''The Philosophical Review'' '''64'''(1) (1955): pp. 43–59.</ref>

In 1825 Whately published a series of ''Essays on Some of the Peculiarities of the Christian Religion'', followed in 1828 by a second series ''On some of the Difficulties in the Writings of St Paul'', and in 1830 by a third ''On the Errors of Romanism traced to their Origin in Human Nature''. In 1837 he wrote his handbook of ''Christian Evidences'', which was translated during his lifetime into more than a dozen languages.<ref name="DNB"/> In the Irish context, the ''Christian Evidences'' was adapted to a form acceptable to Catholic beliefs, with the help of [[James Carlile]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald H.

==Character==
[[Humphrey Lloyd (physicist)|Humphrey Lloyd]] told [[Caroline Fox]] that Whately's eccentric behaviour and [[body language]] was exacerbated in Dublin by a sycophantic circle of friends.<ref>{{cite book|author=Caroline Fox|title=The Journals of Caroline Fox 1835-1871: A Selection|url=https://archive.org/details/journalsofcaroli0000foxc|url-access=registration|year=1972|publisher=Elek Books|isbn=978-0-236-15447-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/journalsofcaroli0000foxc/page/167 167]}}</ref> He was a great talker, a wit, and loved [[pun]]ning. In Oxford his white hat, rough white coat, and huge white dog earned for him the sobriquet of the White Bear, and he exhibited the exploits of his climbing dog in [[Christ Church Meadow, Oxford|Christ Church Meadow]].<ref name="DNB"/><ref>David de Giustino, ''Finding an Archbishop: The Whigs and Richard Whately in 1831'', Church History Vol. 64, No. 2 (Jun., 1995), pp. 218–236, at p, 220.

==Views==
A member of the loose group called the [[Oriel Noetics]], Whately supported religious liberty, civil rights, and freedom of speech for dissenters, Roman Catholics, Jews, and even atheists. He took the line that the [[civil disabilities]] imposed on non-Anglicans made the state only nominally Christian, and supported [[disestablishment]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marilyn D. Button|author2=Jessica A. Sheetz-Nguyen|title=Victorians and the Case for Charity: Essays on Responses to English Poverty by the State, the Church and the Literati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXNzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA90|date=4 November 2013 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-7032-7 |pages=90 note 17}}</ref> He was a follower of Edward Copleston, regarded as the founder of the Noetics taken as [[apologist]]s for the orthodoxy of the [[Church of England]].<ref name="ODNB"/> A devout Christian, Whately took a practical view of Christianity. He disagreed with the [[Evangelical]] party and generally favoured a more intellectual approach to religion. He also disagreed with the later Tractarian emphasis on ritual and church authority.<ref name="DNB"/> Instead, he emphasised careful reading and understanding of the Bible.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

His cardinal principle was that of [[William Chillingworth|Chillingworth]] —‘the [[Bible]], and the Bible alone, is the religion of [[Protestantism|protestants]];’ and his [[exegesis]] was directed to determine the general tenor of the scriptures to the exclusion of [[Dogma|dogmas]] based on isolated texts. There is no reason to question his reception of the central doctrines of the [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], though he shrank from theorising or even attempting to formulate them with precision. On [[Election (Christianity)|election]] he held, broadly speaking, the [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminian]] view, and his antipathy to [[Calvinism]] was intense. He dwelt more on the life than on the [[death of Christ]], the necessity of which he denied.{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1885}}

Whately took a view of [[political economy]] as an essentially logical subject. It proved influential in Oxford. The Noetics were reformers but largely centrist in politics, rather than strong Whigs or Tories.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Nigel F. B. Allington|author2=Noel W. Thompson|title=English, Irish and Subversives Among the Dismal Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fjwxnH8VPcC&pg=PA201|year=2010|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-85724-061-3|page=201}}</ref> One of Whately's initial acts on going to Dublin was to endow a [[Whately Chair of Political Economy|chair of political economy]] in [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]. Its first holder was [[Mountifort Longfield]].<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Longfield, Mountifort|volume=34}}</ref> Later, in 1846, he founded the [[Dublin Statistical Society]] with William Neilson Hancock.<ref name="IrishBio">{{cite IrishBio|wstitle=Whately, Richard}}</ref>

Whately's view of political economy, and that common to the early holders of the Trinity college professorship, addressed it as a type of [[natural theology]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Boylan|author2=Renee Prendergast|author3=John Turner|others=Chief Research Scientist John Turner|title=A History of Irish Economic Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pz5ZBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=1 March 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-93349-3|page=7}}</ref> He belonged to the group of supporters of [[Thomas Malthus]] that included [[Thomas Chalmers]], some others of the Noetics, [[Richard Jones (economist)|Richard Jones]] and [[William Whewell]] from Cambridge.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Winch|title=Riches and Poverty: An Intellectual History of Political Economy in Britain, 1750–1834|date=26 January 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55920-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/richespovertyint0000winc/page/371 371–2]|url=https://archive.org/details/richespovertyint0000winc/page/371}}</ref> He saw no inconsistency between science and Christian belief, differing in that way from some Christian critics of Malthus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winch|first=Donald|title=Wealth and Life: Essays on the Intellectual History of Political Economy in Britain, 1848–1914|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521715393|page=12}}</ref> He differed also from Jones and Whewell, expressing the view that the [[inductive method]] was of less use for political economy than the [[deductive method]], properly applied.<ref>{{cite book|author=James P. Henderson|title=Early Mathematical Economics: William Whewell and the British Case|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ye2p5tMnVAcC&pg=PA72|year=1996|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-8201-0|page=72}}</ref>

In periodicals Whately discussed other public questions. He addressed, for example, the subject of [[transportation]] and the "secondary punishments" on those who had been transported; his pamphlet on this topic influenced the politicians [[Lord John Russell]] and [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Henry George Grey]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Norval Morris|title=The Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwvH5ce94eIC&pg=PA256|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-511814-8|page=256}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Whately was an important figure in the revival of [[Aristotelian logic]] in the early nineteenth century. The ''Elements of Logic'' gave an impetus to the study of logic in Britain,<ref name="DNB"/> and in the United States of America, logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) wrote that his lifelong fascination with logic began when he read Whately's ''Elements'' as a 12-year-old boy.<ref>Fisch, Max, "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v1/v1intro.htm Introduction]", W 1:xvii, find phrase "One episode".</ref>

Whately's view of rhetoric as essentially a method for persuasion became an orthodoxy, challenged in mid-century by [[Henry Noble Day]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Connors|title=Composition-Rhetoric: Backgrounds, Theory, and Pedagogy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=047XAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA221|date=5 June 1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0-8229-7182-5|page=221}}</ref> ''Elements of Rhetoric'' is still cited, for thought about [[presumption]], [[philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]], and [[testimony]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholas Rescher|title=Presumption and the Practices of Tentative Cognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfP-j2wPcuwC&pg=PA18|date=19 June 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45718-7|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Crookall|title=Intimations of Immortality: Seeing that Leads to Believing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqyGM1AXJ-EC&pg=PA14|date=1 November 1987|publisher=James Clarke & Co.|isbn=978-0-227-67662-2|pages=14–}}</ref>

In 1864 Jane Whately, his daughter, published ''Miscellaneous Remains'' from his commonplace book and in 1866 his ''Life and Correspondence'' in two volumes. ''The Anecdotal Memoirs of Archbishop Whately'', by [[William John Fitzpatrick]], was published in 1864.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Family==
Whately married [[Elizabeth Whately|Elizabeth Pope]] (third daughter of William Pope, born 7 October and baptised 22 December 1795 at [[Hillingdon, Middlesex]]) at [[Cheltenham]] on 3 July 1821. She later authored some Christian literature herself, dying 25 April 1860.
