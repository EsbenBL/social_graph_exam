==Early life and education==
Serani was born in Bethpage, a suburb of Long Island in New York. The oldest of three children, she experienced a debilitating depression as a teenager, attempting [[suicide]] at age nineteen. Serani took a medical leave of absence from college in order to recover. Upon her return, she directed her focus to the field of psychology and graduated with a B.A. in psychology from [[Hofstra University]] in 1982. Crediting psychotherapy as a life-saving experience for her, Serani obtained a Doctorate in Psychology from the [[Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology]] at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in 1989, and a postdoctoral certificate in [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychotherapy]] from the Derner Institute at Adelphi University in 2002.

==Career==

Serani has been an invited speaker at national and international venues of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [https://archive.is/20140226014015/http://www.nami.org/MSTemplate.cfm?Section=Calendar424&Site=NAMI_Queens_Nassau&template=Calendar/CalendarEventDisplay.cfm&CalendarEventID=44694&ChapterID=2277/ National Alliance on Mental Illness] and [http://www.ifmad.org/2012/?page_id=614/ The International Forum on Mood and Anxiety Disorders] and [https://www.ted.com/TEDx.] Serani is a go-to media expert and has worked as a [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2114607/ technical advisor] for the NBC Television show [http://www.nbc.com/law-and-order-special-victims-unit/ Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.]

==Publications==

===Books===
In her debut book ''Living with Depression,'' Serani talks about her lifetime struggles with unipolar depression and suicidal thinking, and how finding the right combination of treatments can lead to health and healing. Serani comments on the roadblocks of stigma and reminds us that the pain of depression and most mental illness arise not solely from the illness, but from the harsh response society has to people with these disorders. “One of the greatest things I’ve been able to do,” Serani says, “Is to let others know that there’s no shame in living with a mental illness. Help is out there – and you don’t have to suffer quietly or alone.”

==Personal life==
As a teenager, Serani was treated for depression and cites it as the inspiration for her education and profession.<ref name=2013PWreview>{{cite web|last1=Kayle|first1=Hilary S.|title=BEA 2013: Deborah Serani: Depressed No More|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/57558-bea-2013-deborah-serani-depressed-no-more.html|website=www.publishersweekly.com|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref>
