'''Frederic Sterling Lee''' (November 24, 1949 – October 23, 2014) was an American heterodox [[economist]]. His primary theoretical contribution to [[heterodox economics]] lies in the areas of pricing, price, production, costs, market competition, market governance, and the modeling the economy as a disaggregated, emergent whole. He was the founding editor of the ''[http://heterodoxnews.com Heterodox Economics Newsletter]'' (2004–09), the editor of the ''[[American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]'' (2009–13), the president of the [http://associationforinstitutionalthought.org Association for Institutional Thought] (2012), the president of the [http://afee.net Association for Evolutionary Economics] (2015), and the founder and honorary life president of the [http://hetecon.net Association for Heterodox Economics]. Lee authored and edited seventeen books, including ''Post Keynesian Price Theory'' (1998), ''A History of Heterodox Economics'' (2009), and ''Microeconomic Theory: A Heterodox Approach'' (2017). He published fifty-six articles and over a hundred book chapters, book entries, book reviews, and notes of one sort or another.

==Biography==

Lee was born in 1949 in [[Nyack, New York]], and grew up in Virginia. His father, Sterling Lee, was a labor lawyer and his mother, Marian Burks Lee, was a politically active person. With this family background he was aware of progressive politics and civil and workers rights even in his early days. He went to Frostburg State College (Maryland, 1968–1972) and obtained a BA degree in history. While doing his undergraduate study, he was interested in philosophy and later in economics because he found that social questions in the 19th century were mainly examined by economists. After two years of working in Saudi Arabia (a supply clerk position with the Corps of Engineers in Riyadh), he returned to the United States and continued his study at Columbia University in New York City. In 1977 Fred Lee met [[Alfred S. Eichner]] who later became his “mentor, dissertation advisor, and friend.” He once noted that the “discovery of Eichner” was “the most important in my academic career.” With Eichner's encouragement and support, Fred Lee started his PhD study in economics at [[Rutgers University]] in 1978, where he was taught by [[Alfred Eichner]], [[Paul Davidson (economist)|Paul Davidson]], [[Jan Kregel]], Nina Shapiro, and [[Alessandro Roncaglia]], among others. After graduating from Rutgers University in 1983, he taught at University of California—Riverside (1981-1984), [[Roosevelt University]] (Chicago, 1984–1990), Staffordshire Polytechnic (Stoke-on-Trent, UK, 1990–1991), [[De Montfort University]] (Leicester, UK, 1991–2000), and the [[University of Missouri—Kansas City]] (2000–2014).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sites.google.com/view/leefs/cv/predestined-to-heterodoxy|title=Predestine to Heterodoxy or How I became a Heterodox Economist|author=Frederic S.
