===University of Chicago===
During Sonnenschein's presidency at the University of Chicago which started on July 1, 1993, he increased the school's fund raising expectations, devoted many resources to the improvement of campus life and facilities, fortified the enrollment of the best students in the nation, and furthered a comprehensive plan to continue expanding the undergraduate College which had been started by the previous presidents of the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://president.uchicago.edu/directory/hugo-sonnenschein|title=Hugo Sonnenschein 1993–2000|date=June 12, 2012|publisher=University of Chicago|access-date=December 8, 2020}}</ref>  Sonnenschein's Campus Master Plan (only the fourth in the 108 year history of the school) included the construction of the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center, building a new campus for the Graduate School of Business and increasing the University library's capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://president.uchicago.edu/directory/hugo-sonnenschein|title=Hugo Sonnenschein 1993–2000|date=June 12, 2012|publisher=University of Chicago|access-date=December 8, 2020}}</ref>  During this time, University of Chicago students took first place in 14 of 21 fields of study and second in six of the remaining seven fields of study at junior-level faculty hires in universities across states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://president.uchicago.edu/directory/hugo-sonnenschein|title=Hugo Sonnenschein 1993–2000|date=June 12, 2012|publisher=University of Chicago|access-date=December 8, 2020}}</ref>

Under Sonnenschein's leadership, the faculty made significant changes to the curriculum, including a reduction to the required number of "Core" courses in the College.<ref name="Menashi">{{cite web|url=http://s14929.gridserver.com/issues/1.13.99/chicgo.html|title=Doing it the Chicago Way|last=Menashi|first=Steven|date=January 13, 1999|work=The Dartmouth Review|access-date=April 8, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826130050/http://s14929.gridserver.com/issues/1.13.99/chicgo.html|archive-date=August 26, 2011}}</ref>  Some changes also included more opportunities for students to learn foreign languages and study abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://president.uchicago.edu/directory/hugo-sonnenschein|title=Hugo Sonnenschein 1993–2000|date=June 12, 2012|publisher=University of Chicago|access-date=December 8, 2020}}</ref>  These moves had the effect of producing capital through tuition and expanding the school's network of alumni and benefactors,<ref name="Sun Times obit"/> but were also controversial.<ref name="Meyer">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomaroon.com/2004/10/31/gradual-changes-define-the-university|title=Gradual changes define the University|last=Meyer|first=Meredith|date=October 31, 2004|work=Chicago Maroon|access-date=April 8, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328003539/http://chicagomaroon.com/2004/10/31/gradual-changes-define-the-university/|archive-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V63N1/gaz02.html|title=IT'S 'PROFESSOR SONNENSCHEIN' AGAIN|date=Fall 2000|work=Rochester Review|publisher=University of Rochester|access-date=April 8, 2011}}</ref>  They were criticized by students, alumni, and faculty, who regarded them as watering down the university's academic standards.<ref name="Sun Times obit"/>
