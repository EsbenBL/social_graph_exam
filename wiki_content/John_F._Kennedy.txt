'''John Fitzgerald Kennedy''' (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials '''JFK''', was an American politician who served as the 35th [[president of the United States]] from 1961 until [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|his assassination]] near the end of his third year in office. Kennedy served at the height of the [[Cold War]], and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Kennedy represented [[Massachusetts]] in both houses of the [[U.S. Congress]] prior to his presidency.

Born into the prominent [[Kennedy family]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], Kennedy graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1940 before joining the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] the following year. During [[World War II]], he commanded a series of [[PT boat]]s in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] and earned the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]] for his service and war [[hero]]ism. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented [[Massachusetts's 11th congressional district|a working-class Boston district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] and served as the junior [[List of United States senators from Massachusetts|senator for Massachusetts]] from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'', which won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize]]. In the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], he narrowly defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent [[Richard Nixon]], who was the incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. Kennedy's humor, charm, and youth in addition to his father's money and contacts were great assets in the campaign. Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after [[1960 United States presidential election#Debates|the first televised presidential debates]] in American history. Kennedy was the first [[Catholic]] elected president.

Kennedy's administration included high tensions with [[communist state]]s in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of [[Military advisor#US advisors in Vietnam|American military advisers]] in [[South Vietnam]]. The [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of [[Fidel Castro]] in the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].<ref>de Quesada, Alejandro ''The Bay of Pigs: Cuba 1961'' (2011) p. 17</ref> Kennedy authorized the [[Cuban Project]] in November 1961. He rejected [[Operation Northwoods]] (plans for [[false flag]] attacks to gain approval for a war against Cuba) in March 1962. However, his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.<ref name="eu.usatoday.com">{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/30/u-s-planned-261-000-troop-invasion-force-cuba-newly-released-documents-show/813376001/ |title=U.S. planned massive Cuba invasion force, the kidnapping of Cuban officials |work=USA Today |date=October 30, 2017 |access-date=April 15, 2019}}</ref> The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|nuclear weapons treaty]] in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the [[Peace Corps]], [[Alliance for Progress]] with Latin America, and the continuation of the [[Apollo program]] with the goal of [[We choose to go to the Moon|landing a man on the Moon]] before 1970. He also supported the [[civil rights movement]], but was only somewhat successful in passing his [[New Frontier]] domestic policies.

On November 22, 1963, he [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|was assassinated]] in [[Dallas]]. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] [[First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson|assumed the presidency]] upon Kennedy's death. [[Marxist]] and former [[U.S. Marine]] [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was arrested for the [[state crime]], but he was shot and killed by [[Jack Ruby]] two days later. The [[FBI]] and the [[Warren Commission]] both concluded Oswald had acted alone in the assassination, but various groups contested the Warren Report and believed that Kennedy was the victim of a [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy]]. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1964]]. Despite his truncated presidency, Kennedy ranks highly in [[polls of U.S. presidents]] with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and [[Affair#Extramarital affair|extramarital affairs]]. Kennedy was the most recent [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots|U.S. president to have been assassinated]] as well as the most recent U.S. president to die in office.

==Early life and education==
[[File:John F. Kennedy home, Brookline, Massachusetts LCCN2011630152.tif|thumb|Kennedy's birthplace in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]]]
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born outside [[Boston]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] on May 29, 1917, at [[83 Beals Street]],{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=20}} to [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]], a businessman and politician, and [[Rose Kennedy]] (née Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite. His paternal grandfather, [[P. J. Kennedy]], served as a [[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts state legislator]]. Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, [[John F. Fitzgerald|John F. "Honey Fitz" Fitzgerald]], served as a U.S. Congressman and was elected to two terms as [[Mayor of Boston]]. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants.<ref name="JFKlibrary.org misc"/> Kennedy had an elder brother, [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.|Joseph Jr.]], and seven younger siblings: [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], [[Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish|Kathleen ("Kick")]], [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]], [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford|Patricia]], [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert ("Bobby")]], [[Jean Kennedy Smith|Jean]], and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward ("Ted")]].

Kennedy lived in Brookline for the first ten years of his life. He attended the local [[St. Aidan's Church (Brookline, Massachusetts)|St. Aidan's Church]], where he was baptized on June 19, 1917.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyjfk.com/days/june-19-1917/|title=JFK John F Kennedy baptism St. Aidan's church Brookline}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/life-of-john-f-kennedy/fast-facts-john-f-kennedy/churches-attended-by-john-f-kennedy|title=Churches Attended by John F.

In September 1931, Kennedy started attending [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Choate]], a prestigious boarding school in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], for 9th through 12th grade. His older brother Joe Jr. had already been at Choate for two years and was a football player and leading student. He spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie. Their most notorious stunt was exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the next chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain "muckers" who would "spit in our sea". Defiantly Kennedy took a cue and named his group "The Muckers Club", which included roommate and lifelong friend [[Lem Billings|Kirk LeMoyne "Lem" Billings]].{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=11}}

[[File:TheKennedyFamily1.jpg|thumb|The Kennedy family in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], with JFK at top left in the white shirt, 1931]]

In September 1935, Kennedy made his first trip abroad when he traveled to London with his parents and his sister Kathleen. He intended to study under [[Harold Laski]] at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), as his older brother had done. Ill-health forced his return to the United States in October of that year, when he enrolled late and attended [[Princeton University]] but had to leave after two months due to a gastrointestinal illness.<ref>{{cite web|title=John F.

In September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at [[Harvard College]], and his application essay stated: "The reasons that I have for wishing to go to Harvard are several. I feel that Harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. I have always wanted to go there, as I have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a 'Harvard man' is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/jfks-very-revealing-harvard-application-essay/281699/|title=JFK's Very Revealing Harvard Application Essay|first=Eleanor|last=Barkhorn|date=November 21, 2013|work=The Atlantic}}</ref> He produced that year's annual "Freshman Smoker", called by a reviewer "an elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio, screen and sports world".<ref name="Harvard Crimson 1937">{{cite news | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1937/5/5/memorial-hall-auditorium-filled-to-capacity/ | title = Memorial Hall Auditorium Filled to Capacity at Annual Freshman Smoker | work = The Harvard Crimson | date = May 5, 1937 | access-date =February 18, 2012 }}</ref>

He tried out for the football, golf, and swimming teams and earned a spot on the varsity swimming team.{{sfn|Donovan|2001|p=7}} Kennedy also sailed in the [[Star (keelboat)|Star class]] and won the 1936 Nantucket Sound Star Championship.<ref>{{citation|first=John|last=Clarke|title=Selling J.F.K.'s Boat|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/selling-j-f-k-s-boat|date=May 19, 2015| work = [[The New Yorker]] | access-date = October 2, 2015}}</ref> In July 1937, Kennedy sailed to France—taking his convertible—and spent ten weeks driving through Europe with Billings.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=49}} In June 1938, Kennedy sailed overseas with his father and older brother to work at the [[U.S. Embassy, London|American embassy in London]], where his father was President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s U.S. Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]].{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=54}}

In 1939, Kennedy toured Europe, the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Balkans]], and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis. He then went to Berlin, where the U.S. diplomatic representative gave him a secret message about war breaking out soon to pass on to his father, and to [[Czechoslovakia]] before returning to London on September 1, 1939, the day that [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]] to mark the beginning of [[World War II]].{{sfn|Daum|2008|pp=127}} Two days later, the family was in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany. Kennedy was sent as his father's representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of {{SS|Athenia|1922|6}} before flying back to the U.S. from [[Foynes]], Ireland, on his first transatlantic flight.

When Kennedy was an upperclassman at Harvard, he began to take his studies more seriously and developed an interest in political philosophy. He made the [[Dean's List|dean's list]] in his junior year.<ref name="Harvard Presidents">{{cite web | url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/ | title = Obama joins list of seven presidents with Harvard degrees | work = Harvard Gazette | publisher = [[Harvard University]] | date = November 6, 2008 | access-date =February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190338/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/|archive-date=August 1, 2016 }}</ref> In 1940 Kennedy completed his thesis, "Appeasement in Munich", about British negotiations during the [[Munich Agreement]]. The thesis eventually became a bestseller under the title ''[[Why England Slept]]''.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=61–66}} In addition to addressing Britain's unwillingness to strengthen its military in the lead-up to World War II, the book also called for an [[Anglo-American alliance]] against the rising totalitarian powers. Kennedy became increasingly supportive of U.S. intervention in World War II, and his father's isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter's dismissal as ambassador to the United Kingdom. This created a split between the Kennedy and Roosevelt families.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=15–17}}

In 1940, Kennedy graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in government, concentrating on [[international affairs]]. That fall, he enrolled at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] and audited classes there.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=18}} In early 1941, Kennedy left and helped his father write a memoir of his time as an American ambassador. He then traveled throughout South America; his itinerary included Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=68}}{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=21}}

Accompanied by a female acquaintance from a wealthy [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] family, the couple had stopped in [[Middletown, Rhode Island]] at the cemetery where the decorated, [[U.S. Navy|naval]] spy, Commander [[Hugo W. Koehler]], USN, had been buried the previous year. Ambling around the plots near the tiny [[St. Columba's Chapel (Middletown, Rhode Island)|St. Columba's chapel]], Kennedy paused over Koehler's white granite cross grave marker and pondered his own mortality, hoping out loud that when his time came, he would not have to die without religion.

Intelligence had been sent to Kennedy's Commander Thomas G. Warfield expecting the arrival of the large Japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of August 1.

Kennedy gathered around the wreckage his surviving ten [[Patrol torpedo boat PT-109#Crew on PT-109's last mission|crew members]] to vote on whether to "fight or surrender". Kennedy stated: "There's nothing in the book about a situation like this. A lot of you men have families and some of you have children. What do you want to do? I have nothing to lose." Shunning surrender, around 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on August 2, the men swam towards [[Plum Pudding Island]] {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} southwest of the remains of ''PT-109''.<ref name="history.navy.mil"/>{{sfn|Donovan|2001|pp=106–107, 119}} Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.{{sfn|Donovan|2001|pp=106–107, 124}} Kennedy made an additional two-mile swim the night of August 2, 1943, to Ferguson Passage to attempt to hail a passing American PT boat to expedite his crew's rescue and attempted to make the trip on a subsequent night, in a damaged canoe found on Naru Island where he had swum with Ensign George Ross to look for food.{{sfn|Doyle|2015|pp=66–106, 134–139}}

On August 4, 1943, he and his executive officer, Ensign Lenny Thom, assisted his injured and hungry crew on a demanding swim {{convert|3.75|mi|km}} southeast to Olasana Island, which was visible to the crew from their desolate home on Plum Pudding Island. They swam against a strong current, and once again Kennedy towed the badly burned motor machinist "Pappy" MacMahon by his life vest. The somewhat larger Olasana Island had ripe coconut trees, but still no fresh water.<ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3107103.stm "JFK's epic Solomons swim"] BBC News July 30, 2003.</ref> On the following day, August 5, Kennedy and Ensign George Ross made the one-hour swim to Naru Island, an additional distance of about {{Convert|.5|mi|km}} southwest, in search of help and food. Kennedy and Ross found a small canoe, packages of crackers, candy and a fifty-gallon drum of drinkable water left by the Japanese, which Kennedy paddled another half mile back to Olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his hungry crew.  Native coast watchers [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]] first discovered the 109 crew on Olasana Island and paddled their messages to Ben Kevu, a Senior Scout who sent them on to coast watcher Lieutenant Reginald Evans. On the morning of August 7, Evans radioed the PT base on Rendova.

===Commanding ''PT-59''===
It only took Kennedy a month to recover and return to duty, commanding the ''[[PT-59]]''. He and his crew removed the original torpedo tubes and depth charges and refitted the vessel into a heavily armed gunboat, mounting two automatic 40mm guns and ten .50 caliber Browning machine guns. The new plan involved attaching a gunboat to each PT boat section adding gun range and defensive power against barges and shore batteries which the ''59'' went on to encounter on several occasions from mid-October to mid-November.{{sfn|Doyle|2015|pp=181, 187}} On October 8, 1943, Kennedy was promoted to full lieutenant.{{sfn|Doyle|2015|p=182}} On November 2, Kennedy's ''PT-59'' took part with two other PTs in the successful rescue of 40–50 marines. The ''59'' acted as a shield from shore fire and protected them as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the Warrior River at [[Raid on Choiseul|Choiseul Island]], taking ten marines aboard and delivering them to safety.{{sfn|Donovan|2001|pp=172–184}}{{sfn|Donovan|2001|p=189}} Under doctor's orders, Kennedy was relieved of his command of ''PT-59'' on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi.{{sfn|Doyle|2015|pp=193}} From there he returned to the United States in early January 1944.

On August 12, 1944, Kennedy's older brother, [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joe Jr.]], a navy pilot, was killed while on a special and hazardous air mission for which he had volunteered.

On March 1, 1945, Kennedy retired from the [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]] on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant.<ref name="sptimes.com"/> When later asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: "It was easy.

==Journalism==
In April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend of [[William Randolph Hearst]], arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Newspapers]]; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and "expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career".{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=180}} He worked as a correspondent that May and went to Berlin for a second time,{{sfn|Daum|2008|pages=127}}  covering the [[Potsdam Conference]] and other events.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=104}}

==Congressional career (1947–1960)==
JFK's elder brother Joe had been the [[Kennedy family|family's political standard-bearer]] and had been tapped by their father to seek the presidency. Joe's death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest of the Kennedy siblings.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=118}}

===House of Representatives (1947–1953)===
At the urging of Kennedy's father, U.S. Representative [[James Michael Curley]] vacated his seat in the strongly Democratic [[11th congressional district of Massachusetts]] to become mayor of Boston in 1946. Kennedy established his residency at an apartment building on 122 Bowdoin Street across from the [[Massachusetts State House]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Kennedy|url=https://archive.org/details/kennedysorerich|url-access=registration|first=Ted|last=Sorensen|pages=[https://archive.org/details/kennedysorerich/page/21 21]|year=1965|isbn= 978-1-56852-035-3|publisher=Harper & Row}}</ref> With his father financing and running his campaign under the slogan "THE NEW GENERATION OFFERS A LEADER",<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://fansinaflashbulb.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/the-new-generation-offers-a-leader/ |title = The New Generation Offers a Leader|date = March 21, 2016}}</ref> Kennedy won the Democratic primary with 42 percent of the vote, defeating ten other candidates.<ref>{{cite book|title=Massachusetts Secretary of Commonwealth: Election Statistics 1946|url=https://archive.org/details/electionstatisti19461948mass/page/n75/mode/2up}}</ref> His father joked after the campaign, "With the money I spent, I could have elected my chauffeur."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/jfk/#transcript |title = JFK &#124; American Experience &#124; PBS|website = [[PBS]]}}</ref> Campaigning around [[Boston]], Kennedy called for better housing for veterans, better health care for all, and support for organized labor's campaign for reasonable work hours, a healthy workplace, and the right to organize, bargain, and strike.

He served in the House for six years, joining the influential [[Education and Labor Committee]] and the [[Veterans' Affairs Committee]]. He concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the [[Truman Doctrine]] as the appropriate response to the emerging [[Cold War]]. He also supported public housing and opposed the [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947]], which restricted the power of labor unions. Though not as vocal an anti-communist as McCarthy, Kennedy supported the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], which required Communists to register with the government, and he deplored the "[[loss of China]]".{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=26–29}}

When it came to [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], Kennedy, a [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]] supporter, wanted to make sure that the shorelines of [[Cape Cod]] remained unsullied by future industrialization. On September 3, 1959, Kennedy cosponsored the [[Cape Cod National Seashore]] bill with his Republican colleague Senator [[Leverett Saltonstall]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.audubon.org/magazine/may-june-2012/rachel-carson-and-jfk-environmental-tag-team|title=Rachel Carson and JFK, an Environmental Tag Team|date=May 8, 2012|website=Audubon}}</ref>

Kennedy's father was a strong supporter and friend of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Additionally, Bobby Kennedy worked for McCarthy's subcommittee, and McCarthy dated Kennedy's sister Patricia. Kennedy told historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], "Hell, half my voters [particularly Catholics] in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero."<ref name=amex>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/kennedys/ ''The Kennedys''].

However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized at the time. The speech put Kennedy in the apparent position of participating by "pairing" his vote against that of another senator and opposing the censure. Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] community, including [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], in the 1956 and 1960 elections.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|pp=274–79, 394–99}}

On December 17, 1959, a letter from Kennedy's staff which was to be sent to "active and influential Democrats" was leaked stating that he would announce his presidential campaign on January 2, 1960.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/45982923/tampa-bay-times/ |title=Kennedy Letter Opens Campaign For Presidency |date=December 18, 1959 |work=Tampa Bay Times |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200302162505/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/45982923/tampa-bay-times/ |archive-date=March 2, 2020 |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> On January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the [[1960 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic presidential nomination]]. Though some questioned Kennedy's age and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters. Many Americans held [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholic attitudes]], but Kennedy's vocal support of the [[separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] helped defuse the situation. His religion also helped him win a devoted following among many Catholic voters. Kennedy faced several potential challengers for the Democratic nomination, including Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Adlai Stevenson II]], and Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]].{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=38–45}}

Kennedy's presidential campaign was a family affair, funded by his father and with his younger brother Robert, acting as his campaign manager. John preferred Ivy League policy advisors, but unlike his father, he enjoyed the give and take of Massachusetts politics and built a largely Irish team of campaigners, headed by [[Larry O'Brien]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]]. Kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among Democratic elites and voters. At the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and Kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination. In his first major test, Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, effectively ending Humphrey's hopes of winning the presidency. Nonetheless, Kennedy and Humphrey faced each other in a competitive West Virginia primary in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin. Kennedy won the West Virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=38–45}}

When Kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination. Stevenson—the 1952 and 1956 presidential nominee—remained very popular in the party, while Johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders. Kennedy's candidacy also faced opposition from former president [[Harry S. Truman]], who was concerned about Kennedy's lack of experience. Kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to Johnson or someone else, and his well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=45–47}}

Kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader [[Walter Reuther]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3491219/behind-the-picture-jfk-and-rfk-los-angeles-july-1960/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114201919/http://time.com/3491219/behind-the-picture-jfk-and-rfk-los-angeles-july-1960/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 14, 2014|title=Head to Head: JFK and RFK, Los Angeles, July 1960|last=Cosgrave|first=Ben|date=May 24, 2014|website=Time Magazine|access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref> and other liberal supporters when he [[Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection, 1960|chose Johnson]] as his vice presidential nominee. He believed that the Texas Senator could help him win support from the [[Southern United States|South]].{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|p=47}} The choice infuriated many in labor.

At the start of the fall general election campaign, the Republican nominee and incumbent vice president Richard Nixon held a six-point lead in the polls.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|p=49}} Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Roman Catholicism, the [[Cuban Revolution]], and whether the space and missile programs of the Soviet Union had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision-making, he famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960: "I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic.

His score among white Protestants would ultimately be lower than Adlai Stevenson's in 1956, though Stevenson lost his election.

Between September and October, Kennedy squared off against Nixon in the first televised [[1960 United States presidential debates|presidential debates]] in U.S. history. During these programs, Nixon had an injured leg, "[[five o'clock shadow]]", and was perspiring, making him look tense and uncomfortable. Conversely, Kennedy wore makeup and appeared relaxed, which helped the large television audience to view him as the winner.

Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls. On [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote#1960 Alabama results ambiguity|by most accounts]], Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).{{sfn|Dudley|Shiraev|2008|p=83}} Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the [[civil rights movement]]; they voted for Senator [[Harry F.

John F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961. In [[Inaugural address of John F. Kennedy|his inaugural address]], he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens, famously saying, "Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the "common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself".<ref name="JFKlibrary.org Inaugural Address">{{cite web|title=Inaugural Address |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Ready-Reference/JFK-Quotations/Inaugural-Address.aspx |date=January 20, 1961 |first=John F. |last=Kennedy |publisher=[[John F.

<blockquote>"All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin." In closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: "Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you."<ref name="JFKlibrary.org Inaugural Address"/></blockquote>

The address reflected Kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|p=52}}

Kennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former General Eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping Eisenhower's methods.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=22}} Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. "We can learn our jobs together", he stated.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=23, 25}}

Much to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the [[House Rules Committee]] in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=56}} The president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings.

===Foreign policy===
{{main|Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration}}
[[File:US President John Kennedy Presidential Trips.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Foreign trips of John F. Kennedy during his presidency]]

President Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the [[Cold War]]. In 1961 he anxiously anticipated a summit with [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into the [[Vienna summit]] of June 1961.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|pp=76–78}}

On the way to the summit, Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet French President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style. The French president feared the United States' presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris, saying that he would be remembered as "the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=145}}

[[File:President Kennedy in Vienna, 1961, USIA.ogv|thumb|right|Clip of President Kennedy's meeting with Nikita Khrushchev in [[Vienna]], 1961]]
On June 4, 1961, the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and [[East Berlin]]. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in [[West Berlin]] would be regarded as an act of war.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=161–171}} Shortly after the president returned home, the U.S.S.R. announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=175}}

In the weeks immediately following the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people [[Republikflucht|fled from East Berlin]] to the western sector, reacting to statements from the U.S.S.R. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where [[Dean Acheson]] took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=185}} In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.25|1961|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=201}}

A month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Germans into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences, which were quickly upgraded to the [[Berlin Wall]], around the city. Kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from the West to West Berlin continued. This course was altered when West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States. Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson and [[Lucius D. Clay]], along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through East Germany, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U.S. to West Berlin.{{sfn|Daum|2008|pages=51–55}}{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=213}}

Kennedy gave a speech at [[Saint Anselm College]] on May 5, 1960, regarding America's conduct in the emerging Cold War.

====Cuba and the Bay of Pigs Invasion====
{{main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}
[[File:President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson prior to ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson walking on the White House grounds]]

The Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime in Cuba. Led by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), with help from the U.S. military, the plan was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=233, 238}}<ref>Gleijeses (1995), pp. 9–19</ref> led by CIA paramilitary officers. The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people, hoping to remove Castro from power.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=69–73}} Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.

The [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] began on April 17, 1961. Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans, dubbed [[Brigade 2506]], landed on the island. No U.S. air support was provided. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Director of the CIA|director]] [[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]] later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=71, 673}}

By April 19, 1961, the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. Twenty months later, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53&nbsp;million worth of food and medicine.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=268–294, 838–839}} The incident made Castro feel wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.<ref>[[Jean Edward Smith]], "Bay of Pigs: The Unanswered Questions", ''The Nation'', April 13, 1964.</ref>

Biographer [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]] said that Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=95–97}} He took responsibility for the failure, saying, "We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it."{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=290, 295}} He appointed Robert Kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Matthew A.|date=2019|title=Robert Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis: A Reassertion of Robert Kennedy's Role as the President's 'Indispensable Partner' in the Successful Resolution of the Crisis|journal=History|language=en|volume=104|issue=361|pages=473–503|doi=10.1111/1468-229X.12815|s2cid=164907501|issn=1468-229X|url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10075581/1/Hayes_%20Robert%20Kennedy%20and%20the%20Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis%20Final%20Accepted%20Manuscript.pdf}}</ref>

In late-1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including [[Edward Lansdale]], Secretary [[Robert McNamara]], and others. The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=264}} In March 1962, Kennedy rejected [[Operation Northwoods]], proposals for [[false flag]] attacks against American military and civilian targets,<ref name="1962USJCOS">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1962USJointChiefsOfStaffOperationNorthwoodsUnclassifiedDocument/page/n11|title=1962 US Joint Chiefs Of Staff Operation Northwoods Unclassified Document Bolsheviks NWO|date=1962|website=Internet Archive}}</ref> and blaming them on the Cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba.

{{Wikisource|Cuban Missile Crisis}}

On October 14, 1962, CIA [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy planes [[Aerial reconnaissance#Cold War|took photographs]] of the Soviets' construction of [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]] sites in Cuba. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=345}}

Kennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to [[nuclear war]] with the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons. The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=245}}

More than a third of [[U.S. National Security Council]] (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of "[[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in reverse".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=387}} There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that Eisenhower had placed [[PGM-19 Jupiter]] missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958. It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=388}} In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine. On October 22, he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced the decision on TV.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=389}}

The U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. The [[Organization of American States]] gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. The president exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=390}} United Nations (UN) Secretary General [[U Thant]] requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=403}}

One Soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded. On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=426}} The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missiles.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|pp=184–186}}

This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that "the humanity" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=189}} The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=425}}

When President Kennedy took office, he privately instructed the CIA that any plan must include [[plausible deniability]] by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=140–142}} In June 1961, the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State [[Chester Bowles]] led a cautious reaction by the nation.

In late 1961, President Kennedy sent [[Roger Hilsman]], then director of the State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]], to assess the situation in Vietnam. There, Hilsman met Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson]], head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam, and the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] was formed. It was approved by Kennedy and South Vietnam President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]. It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents. It was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. By November 1963, the program waned and officially ended in 1964.{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=1070}}

In early 1962, Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the National Security Action Memorandum&nbsp;– "Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation)".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=281}} "[[Operation Ranch Hand]]", a large-scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of South Vietnam.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=259}} Depending on which assessment Kennedy accepted (Department of Defense or State), there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded U.S. involvement.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=283}}

[[File:President meets with Secretary of Defense. President Kennedy, Secretary McNamara. White House, Cabinet Room - NARA - 194244.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Kennedy meets with Secretary of Defense, [[Robert McNamara]], 1962]]

In April 1963, Kennedy assessed the situation in Vietnam, saying, "We don't have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate us. They are going to throw our asses out of there at any point. But I can't give up that territory to the communists and get the American people to re-elect me."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=484}}

On August 21, just as the new U.S. Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] arrived, Diem and his brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]] ordered South Vietnam forces, funded and trained by the CIA, to quell Buddhist demonstrations. The crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d'état to remove Diem with (or perhaps by) his brother, Nhu.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=558}} Lodge was instructed to try getting Diem and Nhu to step down and leave the country. Diem would not listen to Lodge.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=559}} [[Cable 243]] (DEPTEL 243) followed, dated August 24, declaring that Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu's actions, and Lodge was ordered to pressure Diem to remove Nhu.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=562–563}} Lodge concluded that the only option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and Nhu.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=573}} At week's end, orders were sent to Saigon and throughout Washington to "destroy all coup cables".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=577}} At the same time, the first formal anti-Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by U.S. clergy from the Ministers' Vietnam Committee.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=560}}

A White House meeting in September was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals; the president was given updated assessments after [[Krulak Mendenhall mission|personal inspections on the ground]] by the Departments of Defense (General [[Victor Krulak]]) and State ([[Joseph Mendenhall]]). Krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any U.S. influence. Kennedy reacted, asking, "Did you two gentlemen visit the same country?" The president was unaware that both men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=595}}

In October 1963, the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] to a Vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. The objective of the [[McNamara Taylor mission]] "emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=602}} In meetings with McNamara, Taylor, and Lodge, Diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel McNamara's previous optimism about Diem.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=609}} Taylor and McNamara were enlightened by Vietnam's vice president, [[Nguyen Ngoc Tho]] (choice of many to succeed Diem), who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=610}} At Kennedy's insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the NSC considered to be a "strategic fantasy".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=613}}

In late October, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot. The source, Vietnamese General [[Duong Van Minh]] (also known as "Big Minh"), wanted to know the U.S. position. Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=617}} On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by "Big Minh", [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|overthrew the Diem government]], arresting [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|and then killing Diem and Nhu]]. Kennedy was shocked by the deaths.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=650}}

News of the coup led to renewed confidence initially—both in America and in South Vietnam—that the war might be won.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=651}} [[McGeorge Bundy]] drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas. It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia. Before leaving for Dallas, Kennedy told [[Michael Forrestal]] that "after the first of the year&nbsp;... [he wanted] an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there&nbsp;... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top". When asked what he thought the president meant, Forrestal said, "It was devil's advocate stuff."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=660}}

On June 10, 1963, Kennedy, at the high point of his rhetorical powers,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mufson|first1=Steve|title=Obama will echo Kennedy's American University nuclear speech from 1963|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-will-echo-kennedys-american-university-nuclear-speech-from-1963/2015/08/04/b037d0fe-3ab8-11e5-b3ac-8a79bc44e5e2_story.html|access-date=August 6, 2015|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 4, 2015}}</ref> delivered the [[American University speech|commencement address at American University]] in Washington, D.C. Also known as "A Strategy of Peace", not only did the President outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also "laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S. and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Joy Y.|title=Obama to follow in John F.

<blockquote>to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived—yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace&nbsp;... I speak of peace because of the new face of war ... in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the Second World War&nbsp;... an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn&nbsp;... I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men&nbsp;... world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor—it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance&nbsp;... our problems are man-made—therefore they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=513–514}}</blockquote>

The president also made two announcements: 1.) that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and 2.) that the U.S. had postponed planned atmospheric tests.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=514}}

====West Berlin speech====

{{Wikisource|Ich bin ein Berliner|JFK's Ich bin ein Berliner speech}}

In 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor [[Adenauer]].{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=534}} At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skWRAgAAQBAJ&q=de+gaulle+and+germany+european+counterweight&pg=PA96|title=Christian Democracy in Europe Since 19455|isbn=978-1-135-75385-6|last1=Gehler|first1=Michael|last2=Kaiser|first2=Professor of European Studies Wolfram|last3=Kaiser|first3=Wolfram|year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4U6yAAAAQBAJ&q=de+gaulle+and+germany+european+counterweight&pg=PA204|title=The Militant Face of Democracy|isbn=978-1-107-03740-3|last1=Geis|first1=Anna|last2=Müller|first2=Harald|last3=Schörnig|first3=Niklas|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/degaulleworld00kuls|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/degaulleworld00kuls/page/29 29]|quote=de gaulle and germany european counterweight.|title=De Gaulle and the World|publisher=Syracuse University Press|last1=Kulski|first1=W.

To reinforce the U.S. alliance with West Germany, Kennedy travelled to West Germany and West Berlin in June 1963. On June 26, the president toured West Berlin, culminating in a public speech at [[West Berlin]]'s city hall in front of hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic Berliners.{{sfn|Daum|2008|pages=125–63}}  He reiterated the American commitment to Germany and criticized communism, and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=624}} Kennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism: "Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us." The speech is known for its famous phrase ''"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]"'' ("I am a resident of Berlin"), which Kennedy himself had begun to try out in preparation for the trip.{{sfn|Daum|2008|pages=147–56}} Kennedy remarked to Ted Sorensen afterwards: "We'll never have another day like this one, as long as we live."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=537}}

====Israel====
In 1960, Kennedy stated, "Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom."<ref>John F. Kennedy: "Speech by Senator John F. Kennedy, Zionists of America Convention, Statler Hilton Hotel, New York, NY," August 26, 1960</ref>

As president, Kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with Israel, and he is credited as the founder of the US-Israeli military alliance, which would be continued under subsequent presidents. Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a "special relationship" (as he described it to [[Golda Meir]]) between the US and Israel.<ref>{{cite book | title=Balancing Act: US Foreign Policy and the Arab-Israeli Conflict | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Shannon, Vaughn P. | year=2003 | location=Aldershot | page=55 | isbn=978-0-7546-3591-8}}</ref>

[[File:Kennedy-Golda Meir.jpg|thumb|upright|Kennedy with Israeli Foreign Minister [[Golda Meir]], December 27, 1962]]

Kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to Israel in 1962 and, beginning in 1963, was the first US president to allow the sale to Israel of advanced US weaponry (the [[MIM-23 Hawk]]) as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies, which were opposed by Arab neighbors; those policies included Israel's water project on the [[Jordan River]].<ref>Walt, Stephen M. (1987). ''The Origins of Alliances'', Cornell University Press, pp. 95–96</ref>

As a result of this newly created security alliance, Kennedy also encountered tensions with the Israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in [[Dimona]], which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East. After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the Israeli government, [[David Ben-Gurion]] stated in a speech to the Israeli [[Knesset]] on December 21, 1960, that the purpose of the nuclear plant at [[Beersheba]] was for "research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna".{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=201}} When Ben-Gurion met with Kennedy in New York, he claimed that Dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes "for the time being".{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=201}}

In 1963 the Kennedy administration was engaged in a now-declassified diplomatic standoff with the leaders of Israel.<ref name="Haaretz2019">{{Cite news | url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-how-a-standoff-with-the-u-s-almost-blew-up-israel-s-nuclear-program-1.7193419 |title = How a Standoff with the U.S. Almost Blew up Israel's Nuclear Program|newspaper = Haaretz|date = May 3, 2019|last1 = Cohen|first1 = Avner}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2019-05-02/battle-letters-1963-john-f-kennedy-david-ben-gurion-levi-eshkol-us-inspections-dimona | title=The Battle of the Letters, 1963: John F. Kennedy, David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol, and the U.S. Inspections of Dimona &#124; National Security Archive| date=April 29, 2019}}</ref> In a May 1963 letter to Ben-Gurion, Kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated that American support to Israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the Israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, Ben-Gurion repeated previous reassurances that Dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes. The Israeli government resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities to [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspections. In 1962 the US and Israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime. A science attaché at the embassy in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of the Dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead American scientists when they visited.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}}

According to [[Seymour Hersh]], the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the Americans. Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg stated: "It was part of my job to tip them off that Kennedy was insisting on [an inspection]."{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}} Hersh contends that the inspections were conducted in such a way that it "guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as the president and his senior advisors had to understand: the American inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence of Israel."<ref>Hersh, ''Samson Option'', pp. 110–11</ref> [[Marc Trachtenberg]] argued that "[a]lthough [he was] well aware of what the Israelis were doing, Kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of Israeli compliance with America's non-proliferation policy."<ref>{{cite book|author=Trachtenberg, Marc|title=A Constructed Peace: The Making of the European Settlement, 1945–1963|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=February 8, 1999|page=403, Appendix Eight (Chapter Nine, Note 134)|url= http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/appendices/appendixVIII.html|access-date=November 20, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803125625/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/appendices/appendixVIII.html | archive-date=August 3, 2016}}</ref> The documents reveal the deep concern the Kennedy Administration had over Dimona, and while Kennedy understood the United States and the international community may not be capable of preventing Israel or any nation, he certainly was not satisfied to learn Israel was using Dimona for the production of plutonium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-seeks-to-impede-israel-s-nuclear-development-august-1961|title = U.S. Seeks to Impede Israel's Nuclear Development (August 1961)}}</ref> The American who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find "ways to not reach the point of taking action against Israel's nuclear weapons program".<ref>Hersh, ''Samson Option'', p. 112</ref>

[[Rodger Davies]], the director of the State Department's Office of Near Eastern Affairs, concluded in March 1965 that Israel was developing [[nuclear weapons]]. He reported that Israel's target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968–1969.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=203}} On May 1, 1968, Undersecretary of State [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] told President Johnson that Dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year. The State Department argued that if Israel wanted arms, it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}} Dimona was never placed under IAEA safeguards. Attempts to write Israeli adherence to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) into contracts for the supply of U.S. weapons continued throughout 1968.{{sfn|Salt|2008|pp=201–205}}

Israeli national interests to an extent were also at odds with Kennedy's endorsement of the United Nation's Johnson Plan, which devised a plan to return a small percentage of displaced Palestinians from the war of 1948 into what was by then, Israel. This continuation of the late UN Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskjold]]'s plan for Palestinian repatriation particularity disturbed persons who had a hard line view of even Arab resettlement in Israel, or the more heavily feared, full repatriation. The later plan was spearheaded by the Palestine Conciliation Commission's Dr. Joseph E. Johnson, while the United Nations attempted to oversee progression from writing - into action.

====Iraq====

Relations between the United States and Iraq became strained following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy on July 14, 1958, which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by Brigadier [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]].{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=3–5}} On June 25, 1961, Qasim mobilized troops along the border between Iraq and [[Kuwait]], declaring the latter nation "an indivisible part of Iraq" and causing a short-lived "Kuwait Crisis". The United Kingdom—which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was dependent on Kuwaiti oil—responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to [[Bahrain]], and the UK, at the urging of the Kennedy administration, brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The situation was resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong [[Arab League]] force, which acted as a barrier against the Iraqi threat.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=36}}

In December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the partially American-controlled [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC)'s [[concessionary holding]] to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as UN member state, which they believed were connected. Senior National Security Council adviser [[Robert Komer]] worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might "grab Kuwait" (thus achieving a "stranglehold" on Middle Eastern oil production) or "throw himself into Russian arms". Komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to "get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel".{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=37, 40–42}}

In April 1962, the State Department issued new guidelines on Iraq that were intended to increase American influence there. Meanwhile, Kennedy instructed the CIA—under the direction of [[Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.]]—to begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=43–45}}

The anti-imperialist and anti-communist [[Iraqi Ba'ath Party]] [[Ramadan Revolution|overthrew and executed Qasim in a violent coup]] on February 8, 1963. While there have been persistent rumors that the CIA orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate that there was no direct American involvement, although the CIA was actively seeking a suitable replacement for Qasim within the Iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier Ba'athist coup plot.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=45, 57–58}} The Kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $55-million arms deal for Iraq.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=60–61, 80}}

====Nuclear Test Ban Treaty====
{{main|Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty}}
[[File:President Kennedy signs Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, 07 October 1963.jpg|thumb|right|President Kennedy signs the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], a major milestone in early [[nuclear disarmament]] in the Nuclear Age]]

Troubled by the long-term dangers of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]], Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=552}} In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy both reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September. In response, the United States conducted tests five days later.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=227}} Shortly afterwards, new U.S. satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=229}} Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the U.S.S.R. perceived itself to be at parity.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=243}}

In July 1963, Kennedy sent [[W. Averell Harriman]] to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=542}} The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to [[Andrei Gromyko]]. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=548}}

Ultimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate ratified this and Kennedy signed it into law in October 1963. France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=550}}

===Domestic policy===
{{See also|New Frontier}}

Kennedy called his domestic program the "New Frontier".

In his 1963 [[State of the Union address]], he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20–90% to a range of 14–65% as well as a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47%.

Kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep [[interest rate]]s down and to encourage growth of the economy.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=293}} He presided over the first government budget to top the $100&nbsp;billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's first non-war, non-recession [[Government budget deficit|deficit]].{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=324}} The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration. Despite low inflation and interest rates, the GDP had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office.<ref name="Bureau of Economic Analysis">{{cite web | url = https://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&ViewSeries=NO&Java=no&Request3Place=N&3Place=N&FromView=YES&Freq=Qtr&FirstYear=1953&LastYear=1964&3Place=N&Update=Update&JavaBox=no | title = BEA: Quarterly GDP figures by sector, 1953–1964 | publisher = United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis | access-date = February 23, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306070717/http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&ViewSeries=NO&Java=no&Request3Place=N&3Place=N&FromView=YES&Freq=Qtr&FirstYear=1953&LastYear=1964&3Place=N&Update=Update&JavaBox=no | archive-date = March 6, 2012 | url-status=dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

====Federal and military death penalty====
During his administration, Kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to ''[[Furman v.

On March 22, 1962, Kennedy signed into law HR5143 (PL87-423), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for [[First degree murder in the United States|first degree murder]] suspects in the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty.<ref name="JFKlibrary.org leg">{{cite web | url = http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/Legislative-Summary-Main-Page/District-of-Columbia.aspx | title = Legislative Summary: District of Columbia | access-date =June 8, 2015 | publisher = [[John F.

====Civil Rights Movement====
The turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s. [[Jim Crow]] [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] was the established law in the [[Deep South]].<ref name=Grantham_p156>Grantham (1988), ''The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History'', p. 156</ref> The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] had ruled in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that [[racial segregation]] in public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially those in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court's decision. The Court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=292–293}}

[[File:Thurgood Marshall 1957-09-17.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thurgood Marshall]], appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by Kennedy in May 1961]]
Kennedy verbally supported [[racial integration]] and civil rights; during his 1960 presidential campaign, he telephoned [[Coretta Scott King]], wife of the Reverend [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter. Robert Kennedy called Georgia governor [[Ernest Vandiver]] and obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother's candidacy.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=292–293}} Upon taking office in 1961, Kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in 1960, recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats controlled congressional legislation.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=487}} Historian Carl M. Brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in 1961 would have been futile.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=487}} During his first year in office, Kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his May appointment of civil rights attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]] to the federal bench.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}}

In his first State of the Union Address in January 1961, President Kennedy said, "The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race—at the ballot box and elsewhere—disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage."<ref>"John F. Kennedy", Urs Swharz, Paul Hamlyn, 1964</ref> Kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, including anti-poverty legislation, and he distanced himself from it.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|pp=60, 66}}

Kennedy was concerned with other issues in the early part of his administration, such as the Cold War, Bay of Pigs fiasco, and the situation in Southeast Asia. As articulated by his brother Robert, the administration's early priority was to "keep the president out of this civil rights mess". Civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the South, viewed Kennedy as lukewarm,{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} especially concerning the [[Freedom Riders]], who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south, and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal and state. Kennedy assigned [[federal marshal]]s to protect the Freedom Riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Robert Kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the Freedom Riders to "get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=123–126}} Kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up "hated memories of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]" after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] among conservative Southern whites.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}}

On March 6, 1961, Kennedy signed [[Executive Order 10925]], which required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin".<ref>[[s:Executive Order 10925|wikisource – Executive Order No. 10925]]</ref> It established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission#Background|President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity]]. Displeased with Kennedy's pace addressing the issue of segregation, Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and use an Executive Order to deliver a blow for Civil Rights as a kind of [[Second Emancipation Proclamation]]. Kennedy did not execute the order.<ref name=kennedyandking1>{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/emancipation-proclamation|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle|date=April 26, 2017|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>

On November 20, 1962, Kennedy issued [[Executive Order 11063]] requiring all federal agencies to prevent racial discrimination in federally-funded [[subsidized housing in the United States]].]]

In September 1962, [[James Meredith]] enrolled at the [[University of Mississippi]] but was prevented from entering. In response to that, Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent 127 [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] and 316 [[United States Border Patrol|U.S. Border Patrol]] and 97 [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|Federal correctional officers]] who were deputized as marshals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usmarshals.gov/news/chron/2012/093012.htm|title=U.S. Marshals Mark 50th Anniversary of the Integration of 'Ole Miss'|website=www.usmarshals.gov}}</ref> The [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]] left two civilians dead and 300 people injured, prompting President Kennedy to send in 3,000 troops to quell the riot.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=71}} Meredith did finally enroll for a class, and Kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier. Kennedy began doubting as to whether the "evils of Reconstruction" of the 1860s and 1870s he had been taught or believed in were true.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} The instigating subculture during the Ole Miss riot, and many other racially ignited events, was the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name=Gitlin_p29>Gitlin (2009), ''The Ku Klux Klan: A Guide to an American Subculture'', p. 29</ref> On November 20, 1962, Kennedy signed [[Executive Order 11063]], which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or "related facilities".{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=580}} Despite this, in [[Boston]], the [[Boston Housing Authority]] (BHA) Board would continue to actively [[Housing segregation in the United States|segregate]] the [[Subsidized housing in the United States|public housing developments]] in the city during the [[John F.

Both the President and the Attorney General were concerned about King's ties to suspected Communists [[Jack O'Dell]] and [[Stanley Levison]]. After the President and his civil rights expert [[Harris Wofford]] pressed King to ask both men to resign from the SCLC, King agreed to ask only O'Dell to resign from the organization and allowed Levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to remain.<ref name=kennedyandking2>{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/kennedy-robert-francis|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle|date=May 31, 2017|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>

In early 1963, Kennedy related to Martin Luther King Jr. his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation: "If we get into a long fight over this in Congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=467}} Civil rights clashes were on the rise that year.<ref>In the first week of June there were 160 incidents of violence. {{harvnb|Reeves|1993|p=515}}.</ref> His brother Robert and Ted Sorensen pressed Kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=515}}

On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy intervened when Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] blocked the [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|doorway]] to the [[University of Alabama]] to stop two African American students, [[Vivian Malone]] and [[James Hood]], from attending. Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and the Alabama [[United States National Guard|U.S. National Guard]], which had just been federalized by order of the president. That evening Kennedy gave his famous [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights]] on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation—to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=521–523}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkcivilrights.htm | title = Civil Rights Address | access-date =September 20, 2007 | last = Kennedy | first = John F. | work = AmericanRhetoric.com }}</ref>

His proposals became part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The day ended with the murder of an NAACP leader, [[Medgar Evers]], in front of his home in Mississippi.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=966}} As the president had predicted, the day after his TV speech, and in reaction to it, House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia (Area Redevelopment Administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=524}} When Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. complimented Kennedy on his remarks, Kennedy bitterly replied, "Yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the House." He then added, "But of course, I had to give that speech, and I'm glad that I did."{{sfn|Cohen|2016|p=357}} On June 16, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an editorial which argued that while the president had initially "moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment" in regards to civil rights he "now demonstrate[d] a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life".{{sfn|Goduti Jr.|2012|p=206}}

Earlier, Kennedy had signed the executive order creating the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] on December 14, 1961.<ref name="executive order">{{cite web | url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=58918/ | title = John F.

[[File:Photograph of Meeting with Leaders of the March on Washington August 28, 1963 - NARA - 194276.jpg|thumb|Kennedy meets with leaders of the [[March on Washington]] in the Oval Office, August 28, 1963]]

Over a hundred thousand, predominantly African Americans gathered in Washington for the civil rights [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] on August 28, 1963. Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|N.A.A.C.P.]] and Martin Luther King's [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580–584}}

To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches that were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00&nbsp;pm. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a "triumph of managed protest", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580–584}}

Nevertheless, the struggle was far from over. Three weeks later on Sunday, September 15, [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|a bomb exploded]] at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=599–600}} Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=628–631}} Gaining Republican support, Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|Senate filibuster]].{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=492}} The legislation was enacted by Kennedy's successor President Lyndon B. Johnson, prompted by Kennedy's memory, after his assassination in November, enforcing voting rights, public accommodations, employment, education, and the administration of justice.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=492}}

Concerned by these allegations, the FBI deployed agents to monitor King in the following months.<ref name=kingandkennedy3 /> Robert Kennedy and the president also both warned King to discontinue the suspect associations.

Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones "on a trial basis, for a month or so",{{sfn|Herst|2007|p=372}} Hoover extended the clearance so his men were "unshackled" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.{{sfn|Herst|2007|pp=372–374}} The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968.<ref name="the atlantic">{{cite news | title = The FBI and Martin Luther King | last = Garrow | first = David J. | author-link = David Garrow | date = July 8, 2002 | work = The Atlantic | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200207/garrow }}</ref>

====Immigration====

During the 1960 campaign, Kennedy proposed an overhaul of American immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin.

Construction of the [[Kinzua Dam]] flooded {{convert|10000|acre|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} of [[Seneca nation]] land that they had occupied under the [[Treaty of Canandaigua|Treaty of 1794]], and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to [[Salamanca (town), New York|Salamanca, New York]]. Kennedy was asked by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] to intervene and to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control. He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate their displacement.{{sfn|Bilharz|2002|p=55}}<ref name="Kennedy letter 1961">{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = John F. | url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8279 | title = 320—Letter to the President of the Seneca Nation of Indians Concerning the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River | publisher = The American Presidency Project | date = August 11, 1961 | access-date =February 25, 2012 }}</ref>

The [[Apollo program]] was conceived early in 1960, during the Eisenhower administration, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]], to be used as a shuttle to an Earth-orbital [[space station]], flights around the Moon, or landing on it. While [[NASA]] went ahead with planning for Apollo, funding for the program was far from certain, given Eisenhower's ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight.<ref>Murray and Cox, ''Apollo'', p. 60.</ref> As senator, Kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=138}}

In constructing his presidential administration, Kennedy elected to retain Eisenhower's last science advisor [[Jerome Wiesner]] as head of the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]]. Wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration,{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=145}} having issued a report highly critical of Project Mercury.<ref>Levine, ''Future of the US Space Program'', p. 71.</ref><ref>Levine, Anold S.

Webb]], an experienced Washington insider who served President Truman as budget director and undersecretary of state. Webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of Congress, the President, and the American people.{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=146}} Kennedy also persuaded Congress to amend the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]] to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the National Aeronautics and Space Council to the Vice President,
{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=146}}{{sfn|Kenney|2000|pp=115–116}} both because of the knowledge of the space program Johnson gained in the Senate working for [[the creation of NASA]], and to help keep the politically savvy Johnson occupied.{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=146}}

In Kennedy's January 1961 State of the Union address, he had suggested international cooperation in space. Khrushchev declined, as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=502}} Early in his presidency, Kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program but postponed any decision out of deference to Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the Senate.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=138}} Kennedy's advisors speculated that a Moon flight would be prohibitively expensive,{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=392}} and he was considering plans to dismantle the Apollo program due to its cost.<ref>Sidey, Hugh (1964), ''John F. Kennedy'', pp. 117–118.</ref>

However, this quickly changed on April 12, 1961, when Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=393}} Kennedy now became eager for the U.S. to take the lead in the [[Space Race]], for reasons of national security and prestige. On April 20, he sent a memo to Johnson, asking him to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up.<ref name="jfkmemo">{{cite web |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/6XnAYXEkkkSMLfp7ic_o-Q.aspx |title=Memorandum for Vice President |last=Kennedy |first=John F. |author-link=John F.

After Congress authorized the funding, Webb began reorganizing NASA, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers: a [[Kennedy Space Center|Launch Operations Center]] for the [[Saturn V|large Moon rocket]] northwest of [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], and a [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] on land donated through [[Rice University]] in [[Houston]]. Kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another [[We choose to go to the Moon|speech]] at Rice to promote the space effort on September 12, 1962, in which he said:

<blockquote> No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ...&nbsp;We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.<ref name="Kennedy at Rice 1961">{{cite web|url=http://webcast.rice.edu/speeches/19620912kennedy.html|title=President John F.

A [[Requiem Mass]] was celebrated for Kennedy at the [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle]] on November 25, 1963.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=211}} Afterwards, Kennedy was interred in a small plot, 20&nbsp;by 30&nbsp;ft., in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Over a period of three years (1964–1966), an estimated 16&nbsp;million people visited his grave. On March 14, 1967, Kennedy's remains were disinterred and moved only a few feet away to a permanent burial plot and memorial. It was from this memorial that the graves of both Robert and Ted Kennedy were modeled.

The [[honor guard]] at Kennedy's graveside was the 37th Cadet Class of the [[Irish Army]]. Kennedy was greatly impressed by the Irish Cadets on his last official visit to Ireland, so much so that Jacqueline Kennedy requested the Irish Army to be the honor guard at her husband's funeral.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=312}}

Jacqueline and their two deceased minor children were later interred in the same plot. Kennedy's brother Robert [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|was buried nearby]] in June 1968.

While a Congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, [[Vietnam]], and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother [[Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby]], as well as his 27-year-old sister Pat. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other.

Kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the [[media culture]] in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast [[Live television|live]] and made good use of the medium.<ref name="american chronicle">{{cite news|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883|publisher=American Chronicle|date=March 15, 2006|title=Happy Anniversary to the first scheduled presidential press conference—93 years young!|first=Robert|last=Rouse|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913094418/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883|archive-date=September 13, 2008}}</ref> In 1961 the [[Radio Television Digital News Association|Radio-Television News Directors Association]] presented Kennedy with its highest honor, the [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]] Award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtdna.org/article/rtdna_s_kennedy_connections |title=RTDNA's Kennedy connections|publisher=[[Radio Television Digital News Association]], November 26, 2013 |access-date=May 27, 2014}}</ref>

Mrs. Kennedy brought new art and furniture to the White House and directed its restoration. They invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of White House dinners, raising the profile of the arts in America. On the White House lawn, the Kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while Caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home.

The president was closely tied to popular culture, emphasized by songs such as "[[Twist (dance)|Twisting]] at the White House". [[Vaughn Meader]]'s ''First Family'' comedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies. On May 19, 1962, [[Marilyn Monroe]] sang "[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President]]" at a large party in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], celebrating Kennedy's upcoming forty-fifth birthday.

===Health===
[[File:John F. Kennedy after spinal surgery cph.3c33052.jpg|thumb|upright|Kennedy lying on a gurney following spinal surgery, accompanied by Jackie, December 1954]]
Despite a privileged youth, Kennedy was plagued by a series of childhood diseases, including [[whooping cough]], [[chicken pox]], [[measles]], and ear infections. These ailments compelled JFK to spend a considerable amount of time in bed (or at least indoors) convalescing. Three months prior to his third birthday, in 1920, Kennedy came down with [[scarlet fever]], a highly contagious and life-threatening disease, and was admitted to [[Boston City Hospital]].{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=32}}<ref name="jfklibrary.org"/>

Years after Kennedy's death, it was revealed that in September 1947, while Kennedy was 30 and in his first term in Congress, he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at [[The London Clinic]] with [[Addison's disease]], a rare endocrine disorder. Davis estimated that Kennedy would not live for another year, while Kennedy himself hoped he could live for an additional ten.<ref>{{cite episode|title=JFK (Part 1)|series=American Experience|series-link=American Experience|network=[[PBS]]|station=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]|date=November 11, 2013|season=25|number=7|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/jfk/|access-date=September 24, 2019}}</ref> In 1966, White House physician Dr. [[Janet Travell]] revealed that Kennedy also had [[hypothyroidism]]. The presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had [[autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2]] (APS 2).<ref name="Mandel, Lee R. 2009 350–354">{{cite journal | author = Mandel, Lee R. | title = Endocrine and Autoimmune Aspects of the Health History of John F.

Kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery and was written up in the [[American Medical Association]]'s ''Archives of Surgery''. Kennedy's condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 [[Vienna Summit]] with Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, [[hypertension]], impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|p=213}} Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors, one of whom, [[Max Jacobson]], was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial<ref>[http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/dr-feelgood/20251/ New York Sun September 20, 2005: "Dr. Feelgood"] Retrieved July 11, 2011</ref> and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=42, 158–159}}

Into late 1961, disagreements existed among Kennedy's doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise. The president preferred the former because he was short on time and desired immediate relief.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=243}} During that time, the president's physician, George Burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the White House basement, where Kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=244}} Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy's lifetime.<ref>Online NewsHour with Senior Correspondent [[Ray Suarez]] and physician Jeffrey Kelman, [https://web.archive.org/web/20021122141641/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec02/jfk_11-18.html "Pres.

Ghaemi concluded there was a "correlation; it is not causation, but it may not be coincidence either".<ref name="jfkwhmd"/>

In 2002, [[Robert Dallek]] wrote an extensive history of Kennedy's health. Dallek was able to consult a collection of Kennedy-associated papers from the years 1955–1963, including X-rays and prescription records from the files of Dr. Travell. According to Travell's records, during his presidential years Kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems. Travell kept a "Medicine Administration Record," cataloging Kennedy's medications: "injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil, Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and [[Tuinal]] to help him sleep."<ref name = "Dallek"/>

===Family incidents===

Kennedy's older brother [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]] was killed in action in 1944 at age 29 when his plane exploded over the English Channel during a first attack execution of [[Operation Aphrodite]] during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fly.historicwings.com/2012/08/operation-aphrodite/|title=Operation Aphrodite ‹ HistoricWings.com :: A Magazine for Aviators, Pilots and Adventurers|work=historicwings.com}}</ref> His sister [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rose Marie "Rosemary" Kennedy]] was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a prefrontal [[lobotomy]] at age 23, leaving her incapacitated for the rest of her life until her death in 2005. Another sister [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen Agnes "Kick" Kennedy]] died in a plane crash en route to France in 1948. His wife Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a [[miscarriage]] in 1955 and a [[stillbirth]] in 1956: a daughter informally named Arabella.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/blog/the-children-of-jacqueline-kennedy/|title=The Children of Jacqueline Kennedy|website=www.firstladies.org|access-date=April 16, 2016}}</ref> A son, [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy]], died two days after birth in August 1963.

===Affairs and friendships===

Kennedy was single in the 1940s while having relationships with Danish journalist [[Inga Arvad]]{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=83–85}} and actress [[Gene Tierney]].{{sfn|Osborne|2006|p=195}} During his time as a Senator, he had an affair with [[Gunilla von Post]], who later wrote that the future President tried to end his marriage to be with her before having any children with his wife.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/jfk-love-letters-to-swedish-mistress-to-be-sold-at-auction/7ZN6EXIJSFDWFITDSABHEAO5L4/|title=JFK love letters to Swedish mistress to be sold at auction|first=William J.|last=Kole|newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=May 5, 2021|access-date=May 8, 2021}}</ref> Kennedy was also reported to have had affairs with women such as [[Marilyn Monroe]],{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=315–316}} [[Judith Exner|Judith Campbell]],{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=289}} [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]],{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=475}} [[Marlene Dietrich]],{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=58}} [[Mimi Alford]],<ref name=nytimes_garrow>{{cite news|last=Garrow|first=David J.|title=Substance Over Sex In Kennedy Biography|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/28/books/books-of-the-times-substance-over-sex-in-kennedy-biography.html|access-date=January 20, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 28, 2003}}</ref> and his wife's [[press secretary]], [[Pamela Turnure]].{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=475, 476}}

The extent of Kennedy's relationship with Monroe is not fully known, although it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in March 1962 while he was staying at [[Bing Crosby]]'s house.{{sfn|Leaming|2006|pp=379–380}} Furthermore, people at the White House switchboard noted that Monroe had called Kennedy during 1962.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=581}} J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, received reports about Kennedy's indiscretions.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=376}} These included an alleged East German spy [[Ellen Rometsch]]. According to historian Michael Bechloss, in July 1963, Hoover reportedly informed Bobby Kennedy about the affair. Hoover told the Attorney General that he not only had information that the president, but also others in Washington, had been involved with a woman "suspected as a Soviet intelligence agent, someone linked to East German intelligence". Bobby Kennedy reportedly took the matter sufficiently seriously to raise it with leading Democratic and Republican figures in Congress.<ref>Interview with historian  Michael Bechloss on ''The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev'' (CSPAN: June 21, 1991) https://www.c-span.org/video/?19109-1/the-crisis-years-kennedy-khrushchev</ref> <ref>Taylor Branch, "Kennedys and Hoover: How Their Battles Affected King" ''Los Angeles Times'' (December 18, 1988) https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-12-18-vw-756-story.html</ref> Former Secret Service agent Larry Newman also remembered "morale problems" that the president's indiscretions engendered within the Secret Service.<ref>Larry Sabato, "John F.

Kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=116}} According to Reeves, this included "the logistics of Kennedy's liaisons ... [which] required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=291}} Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=478}}

[[Lem Billings]] was a close and long-time friend of Kennedy and the Kennedy family. Billings had his own room in which to stay at several of John F. Kennedy's residences. Though there has never been any proof of homosexual activity between them, Kennedy would often, and even when married, share a bedroom with his lifelong friend.<ref>[[Barbara A.

==Historical evaluations and legacy==
===Effect of assassination===

Television was the primary source that kept people informed of the events that surrounded Kennedy's assassination. In fact, television started to come of age before the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy helped inaugurate network television's first half-hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' anchor [[Walter Cronkite]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronkite|first=Walter|title=A Reporter's Life|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1996|isbn=978-0-394-57879-8}}</ref>

Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In this sense his assassination was the first major TV news event of its kind. TV coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and creating memories of this space in time.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} All three major U.S. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from November 22 through November 26, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9/11.<ref>{{cite news | last = Sanford | first = Bill | title = Viewers Again Return To Traditional Networks |newspaper=The New York Times | date = September 15, 2001 | page = A14 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/15/us/after-the-attacks-television-viewers-again-return-to-traditional-networks.html }}</ref>

The assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the United States but around the world. Many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that Kennedy was assassinated, as with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, before it and the [[September 11 attacks]] after it. UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson II said of the assassination: "All of us. ... . will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours." Many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators, and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect, it has coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, especially the Vietnam War.

==="Camelot Era"===
The term "Camelot" came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the Kennedy administration, and the charisma of Kennedy and his family. The term was first publicly used by his wife in a post-assassination [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] interview with [[Theodore H. White]], in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary [[Camelot (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]], particularly the closing lines of the title song:<ref name="JFKlibrary.org White.

The [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Special Forces]] had a special bond with Kennedy. "It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret," said Forrest Lindley, a writer for the US military newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' who served with Special Forces in Vietnam.{{efn|name=Green Beret|Kennedy reversed the Defense Department rulings that prohibited the Special Forces wearing of the Green Beret. {{harvnb|Reeves|1993|p=116}}.}} This bond was shown at [[State funeral of John F.

Many of Kennedy's speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, he is considered by many Americans to be in the upper echelon of presidents.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} Some excerpts of Kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington.
