== Views ==
For Bardhan, equality of opportunity is more important than equality of income. Equality of opportunity depends on such factors as land distribution, [[education]], and [[social equality]].<ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/pranab-bardhan-how-unequalcountry-is-india/369106/ How Unequal India is?]</ref> In his book ''The Political Economy of Development in India'', Bardhan discusses the nature of dominant proprietary classes in India'. He claims that the industrial capitalist class, rich farmers, and the professionals in the public sector are the three main dominant classes in India which play a major role in influencing and designing public policy. Bardhan claims that there is a conflict of interests among these classes and they fight and bargain to get adequate share in the spoils of the system. This process of negotiation and bargain gives relative autonomy to the Indian state to exert its power.<ref>Bardhan, Pranab (1984). The political economy of development in India.
