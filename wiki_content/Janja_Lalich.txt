Lalich has a [[Ph.D.]] in Human and Organizational Systems from [[Fielding Graduate University]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]].<ref name="zablocki" /> Beginning in the 1970s, Lalich spent around ten years as part of a [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[Marxist-Leninist]] group, the [[Democratic Workers Party]] in California. She later came to realize that the group was a cult. Lalich recalls that during her time in the group she stored questions and doubts in the back of her mind, unable to express them.<ref name="nyt2018" /> Lalich became a high-ranking member of the group working long hours with little contact outside the immediate members. She claims that ex-members were harassed and attacked and that she felt increasingly threatened. Eventually, the group dissolved and she was able to leave.<ref name="rev2018">{{cite web|last1=Paoletta|first1=Rae|title=Women share their real-life horror stories of surviving a cult|url=https://www.revelist.com/feminism/women-cult-survivors/5466/default/8|access-date=26 September 2018|website=Revelist}}</ref>

==Career==
She is a recently retired professor in the sociology department of California State University, Chico, and has contributed several articles to academic journals on the subject of cults and religions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campus Directory|url=http://webapps.csuchico.edu/directory/people/jlalich|access-date=20 February 2015|publisher=CSU, Chico}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Janja Lalich|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Janja_Lalich|access-date=26 September 2018|website=ResearchGate}}</ref> After her experiences in a radical political group that she identifies as a cult, she founded the Center for Research on Influence and Control. In her work, she describes the main features of a "totalistic" control group, or cult: "They 'espouse an all-encompassing belief system', 'exhibit excessive devotion to the leader', 'avoid criticism of the group and its leader', and 'feel disdain for non-members'."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Al-sibai|first1=Noor|title=Expert explains how Trump's GOP has turned into a cult|url=https://www.rawstory.com/2018/06/expert-explains-trumps-gop-turned-cult-warns-spell-will-hard-break/|access-date=26 September 2018|website=Raw Story|date=21 June 2018}}</ref>

Lalich went on to write several books on the subject of cults, including her best known book, ''[[Bounded Choice]]'' (2004), based on the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] cult.<ref name="bbc2018">{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Laurie|title=Thinking Allowed: Charismatic cults|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/thinkingallowed_20050126.shtml|access-date=26 September 2018|website=BBC Radio}}</ref> As a recognized international authority in the field, Lalich has also appeared in several court cases as an [[expert witness]] on coercive control or [[undue influence]].<ref name="vice2018">{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Sarah|title=Courts Are Rarely Kind to 'Brainwashed' Victims|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzyqwz/courts-are-rarely-kind-to-brainwashed-victims|access-date=26 September 2018|website=Vice}}</ref>
