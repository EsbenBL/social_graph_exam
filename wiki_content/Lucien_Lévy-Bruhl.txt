'''Lucien Lévy-Bruhl''' (10 April 1857 – 13 March 1939) was a [[France|French]] scholar trained in [[philosophy]] who furthered [[anthropology]] with his contributions to the budding fields of [[sociology]] and [[ethnology]]. His primary field of study involved primitive mentality.

Born in Paris, Lévy-Bruhl wrote about the 'primitive mind' in his work ''How Natives Think'' (1910), where he posited, as the two basic mindsets of mankind, the "primitive" and the "modern." The primitive mind does not differentiate the supernatural from reality but uses "mystical participation" to manipulate the world. According to Lévy-Bruhl, the primitive mind does not address contradictions.

The modern mind, by contrast, uses reflection and [[logic]]. Lévy-Bruhl believed in a historical and evolutionary [[teleology]] leading from the primitive mind to the modern mind.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Sociologist [[Stanislav Andreski]]<ref>Andreski, Stanislav. ''Social Sciences as Sorcery'', London: Andre Deutsch, 1972</ref> argued that despite its flaws,{{which|date=March 2017}} Lévy-Bruhl's ''How Natives Think'' was an accurate and valuable contribution to anthropology, perhaps even more so than better-known work by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]].

Lévy-Bruhl's work, especially the concepts of ''[[collective representation]]''<ref>Jung CG, "Les Racines de La Conscience – Études Sur L' Archétype", Buchet/Chastel, Paris, 1971, p. 14</ref> and ''[[participation mystique]]'', influenced the psychological theory of [[Carl Jung|C. G. Jung]].
