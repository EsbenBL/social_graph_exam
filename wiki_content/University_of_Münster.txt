==History==
The university has its roots in the '''Münster's Jesuit College''' (''Jesuiten-Kolleg Münster''), founded in 1588, and the convent of lay sisters Liebfrauen-Überwasser, founded in 1040, of which it took its seal. The convent was dissolved in 1773, so that its funds could be used to found the University of Münster on 16 April 1780.

In 1631, [[Pope Urban VIII]] and [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand II]] issued privileges, allowing the establishment of a university in Münster. However, due to a lack of funding, they were only put to use in 1780, when the modern University of Münster was founded with four faculties: [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]].<ref name="Website">{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/profil/struktur.html|title=Geschichte der WWU Münster - Struktur|first=Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster|last=Online-Redaktion|website=www.uni-muenster.de}}</ref>

In 1843, it was renamed to '''Royal Theological and Philosophical Academy''' (''Königliche Theologische und Philosophische Akademie''),<ref name="Website"/> informally '''Münster Academy''' (''Akademie Münster'').

The ceremony of constitution was performed by [[Franz Freiherr von Fürstenberg]]. The university received its current name from Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] on 22 August 1907.<ref name="Website"/>

==European degrees==
1999 saw the beginning of the [[Bologna Process]], which aimed to ensure comparability in the standards and quality of higher education qualifications. The Münster School of Business Administration and Economics was the first one to establish bachelor's and master's degrees.

In the winter semester 2006/2007 nearly all studies have been changed according to Bachelor/Master system. Exceptions are made in studies leading to the [[Staatsexamen]] in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and law.<ref>[http://zsb.uni-muenster.de/en/international_students/undergraduate/] ''Study guide - range of courses and corresponding degrees''.
