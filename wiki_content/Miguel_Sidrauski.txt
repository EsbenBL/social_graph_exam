'''Miguel Sidrauski''' (October 12, 1939 – September 1, 1968) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[economist]] who made important contributions to the theory of [[economic growth]] by developing a modified version of the [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model]] to describe the effects of [[money supply|money]] on long-run growth.  He also published an article on [[exchange rate]] determination.  Sidrauski taught [[economics]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

Sidrauski was born and educated in [[Buenos Aires]].  He entered graduate studies at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1963 and completed his PhD in 1966 under the supervision of [[Hirofumi Uzawa]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. After completing his PhD, he was appointed as an assistant professor at MIT. Sidrauski, who was [[Judaism|Jewish]], was described by his colleague [[Duncan K. Foley]] as “a committed [[Zionism|Zionist]].”<ref>{{cite book |author-link=David Colander |last=Colander |first=David C. |first2=Richard P. F. |last2=Holt |first3=J.

Sidrauski is best known for his 1967 article, "Rational Choice and Patterns of Growth in a Monetary Economy," which was based on his PhD [[dissertation]].  The article analyses a model of a [[representative agent|representative household]] that intertemporally maximises [[utility]], which in turn depends on both the [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and the holding of [[Pigou effect|real balances]] of money.<ref>{{cite book |first=Olivier Jean |last=Blanchard |author-link=Olivier Blanchard |first2=Stanley |last2=Fischer |author-link2=Stanley Fischer |chapter=Money in the Utility Function |title=Lectures on Macroeconomics |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-262-02283-4 |chapter-url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=j_zs7htz9moC |page=188 }} |pages=188–193 }}</ref> The model implies that in steady state, [[capital intensity]] is invariant to the rate of monetary expansion or contraction, a result that is described as [[neutrality of money|superneutrality of money]].<ref name="Fischer" /><ref>{{cite book |author-link=Apostolos Serletis |first=Apostolos |last=Serletis |title=The Demand for Money: Theoretical and Empirical Approaches |location=New York |publisher=Springer |edition=Second |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-387-71726-5 |pages=68–70 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=JoSwG0ZZn5YC |page=68 }} }}</ref>
