Berger is known not only for his discoveries, but also for his unusually public persona in paleoanthropology, and for making his most notable discoveries [[Open access|open-access]] projects. He makes hundreds of talks per year, and has had a close relationship with [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] for many years, appearing in several of their shows and documentaries.<ref name=":2">{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/lee-berger-digs-for-bones-and-glory|title=The Big Fight Over Fossils|last=Williams|first=Paige|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=June 28, 2016}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Berger was born in [[Shawnee Mission, Kansas|Shawnee Mission]], [[Kansas]] in 1965, but was raised outside of [[Sylvania, Georgia|Sylvania]], [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://global.britannica.com/biography/Lee-Berger|title=Lee Berger {{!}} South African paleoanthropologist|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=May 25, 2016}}</ref><ref name=Disputedgenius/> As a youth, Berger was active in the Boy Scouts, [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]], and president of [[Georgia 4-H]]. In 1984, Berger was named Georgia's Youth Conservationist of the Year for his work in conserving the threatened [[Gopherus polyphemus|gopher tortoise]]. He is a Distinguished [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], and received the [[Boy Scouts of America]] [[Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America#Lifesaving and meritorious action awards|Honor Medal]] for saving a life in 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2015/09/10/lee-berger-discovered-new-species-human-ancestor-south-africa-eagle-scout/|title=Lee Berger, headline-making scientist, is an Eagle Scout|date=September 10, 2015|website=Bryan on Scouting|access-date=May 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Skull in the Rock: How a Scientist, a Boy, and Google Earth Opened a New Window on Human Origins|last1=Berger|first1=Lee R.|last2=Aronson|first2=Marc|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4263-1010-2|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=13–19}}</ref>

He graduated from [[Georgia Southern University]] in 1989 with a degree in [[anthropology]]/[[archaeology]] and a minor in [[geology]].

He undertook doctoral studies in [[paleoanthropology|palaeoanthropology]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (Wits) in [[South Africa]] under [[Phillip V. Tobias|Professor Phillip Tobias]], focusing his research on the shoulder girdle of early hominins; he graduated in 1994. In 1991, he began his long term work at the [[Gladysvale Cave|Gladysvale]] site. This marked the same year that his team discovered the first early hominin remains from the site, making Gladysvale the first new early hominin site to be discovered in South Africa since 1948.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Lee R.|last2=Keyser|first2=André W.|last3=Tobias|first3=Phillip V.|date=September 1, 1993|title=Gladysvale: First early hominid site discovered in South Africa since 1948|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=92|issue=1|pages=107–111|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330920109|issn=1096-8644|pmid=8238287}}</ref> In 1993, he was appointed to the position of research officer in the Paleo-Anthropology Research Unit (PARU) (now the Evolutionary Sciences Institute; ESI) at Wits.

==Research career==
He became a postdoctoral research fellow and research officer at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1995. He has been the leader of the Palaeoanthropology Research Group and has taken charge of fossil [[hominin]] excavations, including [[Sterkfontein]], [[Swartkrans]], and Gladysvale. In 2004, he was promoted to Reader in [[Human evolution|Human Evolution]] and the Public Understanding of [[Science]]. He is presently a research professor in the same topic at the Evolutionary Studies Institute (ESI) and the Centre of Excellence in Palaeosciences (CoE Pal) at Wits.

==Research and other activities==
=== Organizational offices ===
Berger served as Executive Officer of the Palaeo-Anthropological Scientific Trust (PAST) (now the Palaeontological Scientific Trust; PAST) from 1994 to 2001.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Brain| first=CK| date=2003| title=A perspective on the PAST| journal=South African Journal of Science | volume=99| pages=235–236}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Blumenschine| first1=RJ| last2=Leenen|first2=A|date=2016| title=What's new from the PAST?|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/pdf/sajs/v112n1-2/02.pdf| journal=South African Journal of Science |volume=112| pages=7–9| access-date=May 25, 2016| doi=10.17159/sajs.2016/a0139| doi-access=free}}</ref> Berger served on the committee for successful application for World Heritage Site Status for the [[UNESCO]] Sterkfontein, [[Swartkrans|Swartkans]], [[Kromdraai fossil site|Kromdraai]], and Environs site.

==== Discovery of ''Australopithecus sediba'' ====
{{main article|Australopithecus sediba}}
[[File:Lee Berger and Australopithecus sediba.JPG|thumb|Berger displays the fossilized bones of ''Australopithecus sediba'' he discovered at the Malapa Fossil Site]]
In August 2008, 9-year-old Matthew Berger, the son of Lee Rogers Berger, found a [[clavicle]] and a [[Human jawbone|jawbone]] embedded in a rock near [[Malapa Fossil Site, Cradle of Humankind|Malapa Cave in South Africa]].<ref name=MaughLATimes10>{{cite news |last1= Maugh II |first1= Thomas H. |date= April 9, 2010 |title= 2-Million-Year-Old Fossils Offer Look at Human Evolution |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/09/science/la-sci-hominid9-2010apr09 |department= News |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date= September 10, 2015 |quote= Subtitle: Scientists say the skeletons of a woman and boy could be one of the most important finds of recent times. A discovery by a 9-year-old led to finding the pair, dubbed Australopithecus sediba. }}</ref> Subsequent excavation, headed by Berger, led to the discovery of numerous bones nearby that dated back nearly two million years. Along with various co-authors, Berger published a series of articles between 2010 and 2013 in the journal ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' that describe what they call a new species, ''[[Australopithecus sediba]]'', which had a mixture of primitive and modern characteristics. The finding was particularly promising because it potentially revealed a previously unknown transitional species between the more ape-like australopithecines and the more human-like ''[[Homo habilis]]''.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> Berger claimed that this new finding represented "the most probable ancestor" of modern-day ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=":2" />

Berger's work at the Malapa site was significant not only because of the discovery itself, but also because of the way he and his collaborators shared information about their findings. While most paleoanthropological investigations are known for a high level of secrecy, Berger worked to make the ''sediba'' site an [[open access]] project. In addition to sharing digital data, he made the fossils found available on request to researchers wanting to study them themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/could-a-renewed-push-for-access-to-fossil-data-finally-topple-paleoanthropologys-culture-of-secrecy/|title=Could a Renewed Push for Access to Fossil Data Finally Topple Paleoanthropology s Culture of Secrecy?|last=Wong|first=Kate|access-date=June 28, 2016}}</ref>

==== Discovery of ''Homo naledi'' ====
{{Main article|Homo naledi}}

On September 13, 2013, two recreational cavers, Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker, discovered a previously unknown, remote chamber within the well known [[Rising Star Cave|Rising Star cave system]]. Discovering the floor of this chamber (now known as the Dinaledi Chamber or UW-101) littered with human-like bones, the pair reported their finds to a colleague, who in turn brought them to the attention of Berger. Recognizing their importance, and unable to access the chamber himself due to his size, Berger organized an expedition over social media that brought six qualified researchers in from around the world to commence an excavation of the remains in November 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150910-human-evolution-change/|title=This Face Changes the Human Story. But How?|date=September 10, 2015|publisher=National Geographic News|access-date=July 6, 2016}}</ref> An early career workshop was organized in May 2014 that brought together 54 local and international scientists to describe and study the more than 1550 fossils recovered. In September 2015, the team announced ''[[Homo naledi]]'' as a new [[Hominini|hominin]] species, citing its unique mosaic of more ancestral and human-like traits.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Lee R.|last2=Hawks|first2=John|last3=Ruiter|first3=Darryl J. de|last4=Churchill|first4=Steven E.|last5=Schmid|first5=Peter|last6=Delezene|first6=Lucas K.|last7=Kivell|first7=Tracy L.|last8=Garvin|first8=Heather M.|last9=Williams|first9=Scott A.|date=September 10, 2015|title=''Homo naledi'', a new species of the genus ''Homo'' from the Dinaledi Chamber, South Africa|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=4|pages=e09560|doi=10.7554/eLife.09560|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4559886|pmid=26354291}}</ref> Other fossil bearing localities in the system were given the site numbers 102 to 104, though research regarding them has not yet been published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/sahris/sites/default/files/heritagereports/Annual%20Report%202014%20the%20Rising%20Star%20Cave%20and%20Empire%20Cave%20systems.pdf|title=Annual Report 2014 for the Rising Star Cave and Empire Cave systems|last=Berger|first=Lee R.|date=January 24, 2015|publisher=SAHRA|access-date=July 6, 2016}}</ref>
