'''Walter Truett Anderson''' (born February 27, 1933) is an American [[political scientist]], [[social psychologist]], and [[author]] of numerous [[non-fiction]] books and articles in newspapers and magazines.

In his public lectures, he frequently speculates that, if we had a history of every advanced species in the universe, we would find that they all had to pass through two large, difficult and unavoidable transitions: (1) accepting conscious responsibility for the future of all life on their planets, and (2) recognizing that their systems of [[symbolic communication]]—such as language and mathematics—don’t merely describe reality, but participate in creating it.

Most of his major writing efforts have engaged one or both of these [[evolution]]ary themes. His defining statement on the first was ''To Govern Evolution:  Further Adventures of the Political Animal''. Its vision of human impacts on Earth’s life systems had been foreshadowed in his earlier book on American [[natural history]], ''A Place of Power:  The American Episode in Human Evolution'', and was further developed in ''Evolution Isn’t What It Used To Be'' and ''All Connected Now''. He is now at work on a new book that explores the evolutionary challenges and frontiers of the 21st century.

His major statements on the second ([[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]]) theme were ''Reality Isn’t What It Used to Be'' and the subsequent anthology ''The Truth About the Truth.'' In other books on related subjects, ''The Future of the Self'' described changing ways that people are constructing personal identities in contemporary [[global society]], and ''The Next Enlightenment'' points out the similarities between Western constructivist thought and Eastern spiritual traditions such as [[Buddhism]].

He is currently President Emeritus of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]] (having served as president 2000-2008); a founding Fellow of the Meridian International Institute; a Fellow of the [[Western Behavioral Sciences Institute]] ([[La Jolla, California|LaJolla, CA]]); and a Distinguished Consulting Faculty member of [[Saybrook University]] in [[San Francisco]].

In his book ''Radical Middle'', author [[Mark Satin]] characterizes Anderson as a [[Radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] thinker.<ref>Satin, Mark (2004).  ''Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now''.  Westview Press and Basic Books, p. 10.  {{ISBN|978-0-8133-4190-3}}.</ref>

==Biography==
Anderson spent his early years on his family’s cattle ranch in northeastern [[Nevada]], but has also lived and worked in [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[England]], and [[Southern California]].  His undergraduate education was in political science at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Later, after military service and several years in magazine journalism, he began graduate studies part-time, completing a doctorate in political science and social psychology at the [[University of Southern California]].

For most of his adult life he has been an independent author, lecturer and consultant.  He has also taught part-time at various institutions including the University of California, Berkeley; Saybrook University; the [[California School of Professional Psychology]]; and [[California State University, Northridge]].  In the 1980s and 90s he was also a contributing editor with [[Pacific News Service]] in San Francisco, where he wrote many newspaper op-ed columns as well as investigative feature stories.  He is on the editorial boards of several journals including The [[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]], [[Futures (journal)|Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning, and Futures Studies]], The [[Journal of Futures Studies]] ([[Tamkang University]], [[Taiwan]]), and Cadmus:  The Journal of the South East Asian Division of the World Academy of Art and Science ([[Zagreb]]).
Now divorced, he has one son—Prof. Daniel Griffith Anderson, a geneticist with the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT, the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and Technology, and the [[Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research]]—and two granddaughters.
He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.
