'''Steven C. Hayes''' (born August 12, 1948){{refn|name=Cloud}} is an American [[clinical psychologist]] and Nevada Foundation Professor at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] Department of Psychology, where he is a faculty member in their Ph.D. program in [[Applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]], and coined the term ''[[clinical behavior analysis]]''. He is known for devising a behavior analysis of human language and cognition called [[relational frame theory]], and its clinical application to various psychological difficulties, such as anxiety. 

Hayes also developed a widely used and evidence-based procedure often used in counseling called [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), which relies heavily on [[counterconditioning]] techniques, such as [[mindfulness]] (a ''private behavior'' in [[radical behaviorism]]), and [[positive reinforcement]]. In their 1999 book ''Acceptance and Commitment Therapy'', Hayes and the co-creators of ACT state that most of the practical therapeutic procedures of ACT have been taken from earlier [[Humanism|humanistic]] therapies and are not new, but are described under new names in the ACT approach. They point out that ACT techniques come from earlier models such as the [[Human Potential Movement|human potential movement]], [[Behaviour therapy|behavioral therapy]], humanistic therapies, mystical traditions, and others.<ref>Hayes, S.

==Career==

Hayes has been President of Division 25 of the [[American Psychological Association]], of the American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology, the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy (now known as the [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]]), and the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]. He was the first Secretary-Treasurer of the American Psychological Society (now known as the [[Association for Psychological Science]]), which he helped form.

Hayes' work is somewhat controversial, particularly with his coined term "relational frame theory" to describe stimulus equivalence research in relation to an elaborate form of B.F. Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' (also referred to as verbal [[operant]]s).{{refn|name=Cloud}}

An author of 38 books and 550 articles, in 1992 he was listed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] as the 30th "highest impact" psychologist in the world during 1986-1990 based on the citation impact of his writings during that period.

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' columnist John Cloud, "Steven Hayes is at the top of his field. A past president of the distinguished Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, he has written or co-written some 300 peer-reviewed articles and 27 books. Few psychologists are so well published".{{refn|name=Cloud}}
