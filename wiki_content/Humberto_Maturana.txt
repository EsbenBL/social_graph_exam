'''Humberto Maturana Romesín''' (September 14, 1928 &ndash; May 6, 2021) was a [[Chileans|Chilean]] [[biologist]] and [[philosopher]], generally known as '''Humberto Maturana'''. Many consider him a member of a group of [[second-order cybernetics]] theoreticians such as [[Heinz von Foerster]], [[Gordon Pask]], [[Herbert Brün]] and [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]].

Maturana, along with [[Francisco Varela]] and Ricardo B. Uribe, was particularly known for creating the term "[[autopoiesis]]" about the self-generating, self-maintaining structure in [[living systems]], and concepts such as structural determinism and structural coupling.<ref>Maturana, Humberto & Varela, Francisco ([1st edition 1973] 1980). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nVmcN9Ja68kC&dq=Maturana++Varela+Autopoiesis+Cognition&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=vN1YS_eUGqD20wSjzLHxBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=&f=false Autopoiesis and Cognition: the Realization of the Living]'', in Robert S.

Overall, his work is concerned with the biology of cognition.<ref name="MRKS 2012">Magnus Ramage, Karen Shipp (2012) ''Systems Thinkers''</ref> Maturana (2002) insisted that autopoiesis exists only in the molecular domain, and he did not agree with the extension into sociology and other fields:

<blockquote>The molecular domain is the only domain of entities that through their interactions give rise to an open ended diversity of entities (with different dynamic architectures) of the same kind in a dynamic that can give rise to an open ended diversity of recursive processes that in their turn give rise to the composition of an open ended diversity of singular dynamic entities.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Maturana | first = H.R. | date = 2002  | title= Autopoiesis, structural coupling and cognition: A history of these and other notions in the biology of cognition  | journal = Cybernetics and Human Knowing | volume= 9 | pages = 5–34}}</ref></blockquote>

==Life and career==
Maturana was born in [[Santiago, Chile]]. After completing secondary school at the Liceo Manuel de Salas in 1947, he enrolled at the [[Universidad de Chile|University of Chile]], studying first medicine in Santiago, then biology in London and Cambridge, Mass. In 1954, he obtained a scholarship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to study [[anatomy]] and [[neurophysiology]] with [[J. Z. Young]] (who later wrote the foreword to ''The Tree of Knowledge'') at [[University College London]]. He obtained a [[PhD]] in biology from [[Harvard University]] in 1958.<ref>See more biographical details in ''History: The Biology of Cognition Laboratory of the Universidad de Chile (1960–2006)''. Juan-Carlos Letelier, Gonzalo Marín & Jorge Mpodozis. Published online at.http://biologyofcognition.wordpress.com/about/</ref>

He worked in [[neuroscience]] at the University of Chile, in the "Biología del Conocer" (Biology of Knowing) research center. Maturana's work has been developed and integrated into the work on ontological coaching developed by [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Julio Olalla]].

In 1994 he received Chile's [[National Prize for Natural Sciences (Chile)|National Prize for Natural Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2012/08/31/558419/bernabe-santelices-es-condecorado-con-el-premio-nacional-de-ciencias-naturales.html |title=Bernabé Santelices recibe el Premio Nacional de Ciencias Naturales |trans-title=Bernabé Santelices Receives the National Prize for Natural Sciences |work=[[El Mercurio]] |location=Santiago |language=Spanish |date=31 August 2012 |access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref>

Maturana established his own reflection and research center, the Instituto de Formación Matriztica. In 2020 he was awarded an honorary fellowship of the [[Cybernetics Society]].

Maturana died in Santiago on May 6, 2021, at age 92, due to pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-05-06|title=A los 92 años muere el destacado biólogo y escritor chileno Humberto Maturana|url=https://www.24horas.cl/nacional/muere-humberto-maturana-quien-era-el-destacado-biologo-y-escritor-chileno-4768380|access-date=2021-05-06|website=24Horas.cl|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-05-06|title=Familia de Humberto Maturana revela causas de su fallecimiento: "Es un momento de gratitud y luto" |url=https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/artes-y-cultura/actualidad-cultural/2021/05/06/familia-de-humberto-maturana-revela-causas-de-su-fallecimiento-es-un-momento-de-gratitud-y-luto.shtml|access-date=2021-05-06|website=BioBioChile - La Red de Prensa Más Grande de Chile|language=es}}</ref>

==Work==

Maturana's research interest concerns concepts like cognition, autopoiesis, languaging, zero time cybernetics and structural determined systems. Maturana's work extends to [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive science]] and even to [[family therapy]]. He was inspired by the work of the biologist [[Jakob von Uexküll]].

His inspiration for his work in cognition came while he was a medical student and became seriously ill with tuberculosis.  Confined in a sanatorium with very little to read, he spent time reflecting on his condition and the nature of life. What he came to realize was "that what was peculiar to living systems was that they were discrete autonomous entities such that all the processes that they lived, they lived in reference to themselves&nbsp;... whether a dog bites me or doesn't bite me, it is doing something that has to do with itself." This paradigm of autonomy formed the basis of his studies and work.<ref name="MRKS 2012"/>

Maturana and his student [[Francisco Varela]] were the first to define and employ the concept of "[[autopoiesis]]", which was Maturana's original idea. Aside from making important contributions to the field of [[evolution]], Maturana is associated with an [[epistemology]] built upon [[empirical]] findings of [[neurobiology]]. Maturana and Varela wrote in their [[Santiago Theory of Cognition]]: "[[Living systems]] are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system."<ref>Maturana, Humberto R. & Varela, Francisco J. (1980): ''Autopoiesis and Cognition. The Realization of the Living''. Dordrecht: Reidel, p. 13.</ref>

===Reflections on life and association with Francisco Varela===

In an article in ''Constructivist Foundations''. Maturana described the origins of the concept of autopoiesis and his collaboration with Varela.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reflections on My Collaboration with Francisco Varela  | journal = Constructivist Foundations | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–163  |  date = 2012}}</ref>

===In popular culture===
Maturana influenced — and appears in coded form as a character in the novel ''Replay'' by German author [[:de:Benjamin Stein|Benjamin Stein]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}
