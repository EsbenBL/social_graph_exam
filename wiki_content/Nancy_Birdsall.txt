Fred Bergsten]] and [[Edward W. Scott|Edward W. Scott Jr.]]<ref name="cgdev.org"/> In a 2016 interview, Birdsell said that the establishment of the CGD coincided "with a shift in thinking among US politicians" in which they began to accept the idea that nurturing stable and prosperous countries overseas, would result in "direct benefits" to the United States—an idea that underpinned the work of the CGD.<ref name="CGD_Mirchandani_20161213"/>

She served as CGD president until 2016 and remained as Senior Fellow and President Emeritus.<ref name="CGD_profile"/>

In 2006 Birdsall published the online version of ''Rescuing the World Bank: A CGD Working Group Report and Selected Essays''.<ref name="Birdsall_Rescuing_20060601">{{Cite web| last = Birdsall| first = Nancy| title = Rescuing the World Bank: A CGD Working Group Report and Selected Essays| date = 1 June 2006 |url=https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/9781933286112-Birdsall-rescuing-world-bank.pdf |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>

In 2011, she co-authored the ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article, "The Post-Washington Consensus: Development after the Crisis", with the author of ''[[The End of History]]''—[[Francis Fukuyama]]—in which they predicted that the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis]] marked the "end of American economic dominance in global affairs."<ref name="Birdsall_Fukuyama_20110303">{{Cite web| title = The Post-Washington Consensus: Development after the Crisis |series=Working Paper |number=244 |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] and Center for Global Development | last1 = Birdsall| first1 = Nancy |first2=Francis |last2=Fukuyama|author-link = Francis Fukuyama |date=3 March 2011 | url = https://www.cgdev.org/publication/post-washington-consensus-development-after-crisis-working-paper-244|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref> They wrote that the November 2008 meeting of [[G20]] heads of state—which unlike the [[G7]]—includes emerging BRIC countries. The inaugural 2008 meeting in Washington, D.C., in which the G20 coordinated a "global stimulus program", became an "established international institution."<ref name="Birdsall_Fukuyama_20110303"/>

A 2012 ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article cited Birdsall, who called on the World Bank to develop a "larger and clearer mandate." She said that the wealthier developing nations should lead the World Bank's transformation into an institution that "could become the focal point for projects to cope with climate change or other major risks to the "global commons." If it failed to do so, it would "gradually become merely one of many aid agencies dealing with a smaller and smaller group of low-income fragile states."<ref name="WaPo_Schneider_20120319">{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| last = Schneider| first = Howard| title = In a globalized world, what role for the World Bank?| work = The Washington Post|access-date=24 February 2020| date = 19 March 2012| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-a-globalized-world-what-role-for-the-world-bank/2012/03/19/gIQARUhyNS_story.html}}</ref>
