===Economic theory===
Brander and Lewis proposed a duopoly model in which it might be rational for the managers of a [[corporation]] to load up on debt, to a degree that would be socially dysfunctional. In the model, management might deliberately incur debts in order to wed its interests to those of the shareholders and pursue with their support a risky low-margin, high-output strategy that in turn may gain market share. This gamble has a chance of success if the other duopolist is low-risk, and would rather leave the market than engage in a price-cutting war. On the other hand, if both duopolists adopt the same approach, though, the result is that they are both worse off than if neither had. Furthermore, that result will have negative social utility—the affected market will resemble the recent airline industry in [[North America]].

==Personal life==
Brander grew up in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. His wife is his collaborator, Barbara Spencer, whom he met while they were at Queen's University.<ref name=profile/> He is an ice hockey fan and wrote a mathematical analysis of Vancouver's teams.<ref name=bigbang/>
