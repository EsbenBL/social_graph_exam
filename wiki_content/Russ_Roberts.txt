Roberts categorizes himself as a proponent of [[Classical liberalism|classical economic liberalism]]. He has said, "I believe in [[limited government]] combined with [[personal responsibility]]. So I am something of a [[libertarian]], but . . . that term comes with some baggage and some confusion."<ref>{{cite news | last = Kenney | first = Allen | title = Russ Roberts Applies Adam Smith to Modern-Day Issues | publisher = REIT.com and Real Estate Investment Trusts magazine | date = March 16, 2015 | url = https://www.reit.com/news/reit-magazine/march-april-2015/russ-roberts-applies-adam-smith-modern-day-issues | access-date = July 21, 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
Roberts has previously taught at [[George Mason University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (where he was the founding director of what is now the Center for Experiential Learning), the [[University of Rochester]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He is a regular commentator on business and economics for [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'',<ref>{{cite news | last = Noguchi | first = Yuki | title = Solving The 'Wage Puzzle': Why Aren't Paychecks Growing? | publisher = National Public Radio | date = August 2, 2018 | url = https://www.npr.org/2018/08/02/634754091/solving-the-wage-puzzle-why-aren-t-paychecks-growing}}</ref> and has written for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

Roberts also blogs at ''[[Cafe Hayek]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cafehayek.com/|title=Cafe Hayek - where orders emerge|website=Cafe Hayek}}</ref> with [[Donald J. Boudreaux]] at George Mason University in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://economics.gmu.edu/people/rrobert2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202050707/http://economics.gmu.edu/people/rrobert2 |archive-date=2011-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Roberts writes and publishes videos on economics, some of which have been viewed millions of times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://russroberts.info/videos/|title=Russ Roberts Videos {{!}} Rap Battles {{!}} The Numbers Game {{!}} Wonderful Loaf|website=Russ Roberts|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> One of the most widely watched videos is [[Fear the Boom and Bust]], a [[Battle rap|rap battle]] between 20th century economists [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]].

===Books about economics===

Roberts has written a number of books which illustrate economic concepts in unconventional ways.

In 2001, he published the novel ''The Invisible Heart: An Economic Romance'', which conveys economic ideas through conversations between two fictional teachers at an exclusive high school in Washington, D.C.: one is a [[market oriented]] economics instructor, and the other is an English teacher who wants governmental protections that curb the excesses of [[Laissez-faire|unrestrained capitalism]].<ref>{{cite magazine | title = Book review of ''The Invisible Heart: An Economic Romance'' | magazine = Publisher's Weekly | date = February 1, 2001 | url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-262-18210-2 | access-date = July 29, 2017}}</ref>

In 2008, Roberts released another novel, ''The Price of Everything: A Parable of Possibility and Prosperity'', which focuses on the experiences of Ramon Fernandez, a university student and star tennis player who, as a child, accompanied his mother to the U.S. after she fled from [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuba]]. Like ''The Invisible Heart'', ''The Price of Everything'' uses conversations between its main characters to address economic concepts (in this case ideas such as the [[price system]], [[spontaneous order]] and the possibility of [[price gouging]] in crisis situations).<ref>{{cite news | last = Steelman | first = Aaron | title = Bringing Life to the Dismal Science: Book review of ''The Price of Everything'' | publisher = Region Focus ("The economics magazine of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond") | date = Fall 2008 | url = https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/region_focus/2008/fall/pdf/book_review.pdf | access-date = July 28, 2017}}</ref>

In 2014, Roberts offered an uncommon perspective on [[Adam Smith]] in his book, ''How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected Guide to Human Nature and Happiness''. The book does not discuss Smith's well known 1776 work, ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''; it instead examines Smith's 1759 precursor to [[behavioral economics]],<ref>{{cite news | last = Brown | first = David | title = Book review of 'How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected Guide to Human Nature and Happiness', by Russ Roberts | newspaper = Financial Times | location = London | date = November 23, 2014 | url = https://www.ft.com/content/25389abe-70a2-11e4-9129-00144feabdc0 | access-date = July 10, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gregoire | first = Carolyn | title = Before 'The Wealth Of Nations,' Adam Smith Penned The Ultimate Guide To A Moral Life | work = Huffington Post | date = September 9, 2014 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/09/before-he-wrote-a-manifes_n_5772360.html | access-date = August 2, 2017}}</ref>

===Policy positions===
Roberts generally opposes [[Keynesian economics]]—particularly [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus spending]]—saying that "it's very hard to argue in logical terms that spending money unwisely is the way to get wealthy."<ref>{{cite AV media |people = Interview of Russ Roberts by Nick Gillespie |title = Russ Roberts: Why Keynesians Always Get it Wrong (and Most Economists Too) |medium = video {quote is at 3 min. 2 sec.} |publisher = Reason magazine |date = October 11, 2012 |url = http://reason.com/reasontv/2012/10/11/russ-roberts-on-the-economic-fallicies-o}}</ref> In October 2011 he initiated a lively, extended conversation with the [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]] over the effectiveness of Keynesian policies by declaring that "Krugman is a Keynesian because he wants [[Big government|bigger government]]. I'm an anti-Keynesian because I want [[Small government|smaller government]]."<ref>{{cite web | url = https://cafehayek.com/2011/10/the-evidence-for-keynesian-economics.html | title = The evidence for Keynesian economics | author = Russ Roberts | website = Cafe Hayek (blog) | date = October 11, 2011}}</ref> Krugman quoted this statement in his response and then said that "Keynesianism is not and never has been about promoting bigger government," and also that "you find conservative economists promoting quite Keynesian views of [[stabilization policy]]."<ref>{{cite web | url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/i-am-not-your-mirror-image/ | title = I Am Not Your Mirror Image | author = Paul Krugman | website = The Conscience of a Liberal (blog) | date = October 12, 2011}}</ref> In subsequent posts, the two economists disagreed on many things, but neither one contested one central idea: Krugman was content to be characterized as a Keynesian,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/06/why-am-i-a-keynesian/ | title = Why Am I A Keynesian? | author = Paul Krugman | website = The Conscience of a Liberal (blog) | date = June 6, 2015}}</ref> while Roberts was not.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://cafehayek.com/2015/06/krugman-is-human-just-like-me.html | title = Krugman is human, just like me | author = Russ Roberts | website = Cafe Hayek (blog) | date = June 23, 2015}}</ref>

Roberts has urged those who formulate [[public policy]] and the economists who advise them to be more skeptical of the findings of [[Empirical research|empirical studies]],<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-15/how-to-restore-faith-in-economics | title = How to Restore Faith in Economics: Mathematical theories didn't predict the Great Recession.

[They] note that many empirical studies disagree with each other, and others are later proven wrong.}}</ref> and he views ultra-specific claims by politicians that their promoted policies will produce a certain number of [[Employment|jobs]] or a certain amount of [[Economic growth|growth]] as inherently unreliable.<ref>{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Kyle | title = When All Economics Is Political: The dismal science has too much junk science, says Russ Roberts, an evangelist for humility in a discipline where it is often hard to find. | newspaper = Wall Street Journal | date = May 13, 2016 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-all-economics-is-political-1463178093 | access-date = August 4, 2017}}</ref>
