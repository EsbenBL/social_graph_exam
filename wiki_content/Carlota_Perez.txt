Her career began at the [[Central University of Venezuela]] where she studied the structural causes of the [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis in the mid-1970s]] and then in the civil service at the Institute of Foreign Trade in relation to the technology aspects of the [[New International Economic Order#History|North-South Dialogue]] (1975–1977). As founding Director of Technology in the Ministry of Industry (1980–1983), she established the first venture capital agency, FINTEC. She has been consultant to most of the major public and private companies in Venezuela, in particular to INTEVEP, the [[Research and development|Research and Development]] affiliate of [[PDVSA]], the national petroleum company.

==Theory==
Carlota Perez is a [[Joseph Schumpeter|neo-Schumpeterian]], and she collaborated with [[Christopher Freeman]] who was her mentor and husband, with whom she closely collaborated. Her articles, from the early 1980s, have contributed to the present understanding of the relationship between basic [[innovation]]s, technical and institutional change, and economic development. Her 2002 book ''[[Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital]]'' has had a very positive response from academics as well as from the financial and the technology-based business communities. It has been translated into Chinese, Korean, Russian and Spanish. The book has contributed to a Schumpeterian understanding of the link between innovation and financial dynamics. In it Perez, speaking from 2002, lays out a history of [[Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital#Five technological revolutions|five technological revolutions]] that follow a similar pattern of bang, bust and, hopefully, renewal.

{{blockquote|text=[The early decades are] a time of innovation for production capital; the new paradigm opens vast opportunities for new products, processes and services as well as for rejuvenating the old. It is also – and especially – the time of fast development of the infrastructure of the new paradigm, which facilitates a host of other related innovations. So during this period, financial capital generates a powerful magnet to attract investment into the new areas, hence accelerating the hold of the paradigm on what becomes the 'new economy'. Financial capital then acts as the agent of massive creative destruction.
[...]
In a world of capital gains, real estate bubbles and foreign adventures with money, all notion of the real value of anything is lost. Uncontrollable asset inflation sets in while debt mounts at a reckless rhythm; much of it to enter the casino.
[After the bubbles collapse and recessions set in, government steps in to regulate and foster] the recoupling of financial and production capital […] When this is effectively achieved, innovation and growth can take place across the whole productive spectrum and financial wealth may take its share in the profits in what is clearly a positive sum game. Less harmonious frameworks […] rather than a golden age, a gilded age), still under the aegis of financial capital, can occur, maintaining some of the previous tensions.|sign=Carlota Perez|source=''Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital'', p. 75-6}}

Since the 2010s Perez has been studying the historical role of the state in previous revolutions bringing about such golden ages as the Victorian boom, the Belle Epoque and the Post War prosperity. She has identified the importance of giving directionality to the technological potential installed in the early decades of each revolution<ref>Perez C.
