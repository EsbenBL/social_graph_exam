==Biography==

===Early years===
Kydland grew up as the eldest of six siblings at the family farm in Søyland, [[Gjesdal]], which is located in the [[Jæren]] farming region in [[Rogaland]] county, southwestern [[Norway]]. He recalls having had a liberal upbringing, his parents not imposing many limitations on their children. Finn Kydland became interested in mathematics and economics as a young adult, after he did some [[bookkeeping]] at a friend's [[mink]] farm.

With a freshly awakened interest in theoretical economics, Kydland earned a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] from NHH in 1968 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Carnegie Mellon]] in 1973, [[dissertation]]: ''Decentralized Macroeconomic Planning'', supervised by [[Edward C. Prescott]].<ref>{{Google books |id==Hl3nkE1ZV8YC |page=240 |title=Nobel Faces }}</ref> After his Ph.D. he returned to NHH as an assistant professor.  In 1978 he moved back to Carnegie Mellon as an associate professor.  He has been living in the United States since then.

===Scholarship===
Kydland's areas of expertise are [[economics]] in general and [[political economy]]. His main areas of teaching and interest are [[business cycle]]s, [[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[fiscal policy]] and [[labor economics]].  He joined the faculty of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1977, where he served as a [[Professor]] of Economics until 2004, when he became a faculty member of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2017/017971/cost-health|title=The Cost of Health|work=The UCSB Current|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}</ref> and founded the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance (LAEF) at this same institution.<ref>http://www.laef.ucsb.edu/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://econ.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/finn-kydland-ph.d|title=Faculty - Finn Kydland|website=econ.ucsb.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> He is a Research Associate for the [[Federal Reserve Banks]] of [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland|Cleveland]] and [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|St. Louis]], and a Fellow at the [[IC² Institute]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].
