[[Stanford University]] economist [[John H. Cochrane]] gave the book a negative review,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Cochrane|first=John H.|date=June 5, 2020|title='The Deficit Myth' Review: Years of Magical Thinking|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-deficit-myth-review-years-of-magical-thinking-11591396579|access-date=October 26, 2020|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> saying that her "implications don't lead to her desired conclusions ... her logic, facts and language turn into pretzels". Cochrane asserted that Kelton's analysis of [[inflation]] was biased,<ref name=":0"/> and that the book cited "no articles in major peer-reviewed journals, monographs with explicit models and evidence, or any of the other trappings of economic discourse".<ref name=":0"/>

[[New York University]] economist Alberto Bisin also panned the book, writing, "it's not that the public-spending agenda proposed in the book wouldn't be worthwhile, or that monetization is never a useful tool of monetary policy. ... These are all issues currently studied and debated in (mainstream) academic and policy circles. But MMT, as exposed in the book, appears to be a very poor attempt at supporting this political agenda, with no coherent theoretical support."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bisin|first=Alberto|date=2020|title=Review: The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People's Economy|url=https://s18798.pcdn.co/albertobisin/wp-content/uploads/sites/16384/2020/10/KeltonByBisin.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Literature}}</ref>

Former [[European Central Bank]] chief economist [[Otmar Issing]] gave the book a negative review in an article criticizing the [[Modern Monetary Theory]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Issing|first=Otmar|date=November 3, 2020|title=The MMT Myth {{!}} by Otmar Issing|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/mmt-myth-threat-to-central-bank-independence-by-otmar-issing-2020-11|access-date=November 4, 2020|website=Project Syndicate|language=en}}</ref>

Former [[Yale University]] economics professor and [[Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs]] [[Richard N. Cooper]] called ''The Deficit Myth'' a "clear and vigorously written book" in a review for ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''. According to Cooper, the "U.S. congressional fiscal action in response to the pandemic, as well as new programs launched by the Federal Reserve, suggests that the author is at least partly right in her assessment of the spending power of governments."<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-09-17|title=The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People’s Economy|language=en-US|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-08-11/deficit-myth-modern-monetary-theory-and-birth-peoples-economy|access-date=2021-09-13|issn=0015-7120}}</ref>
