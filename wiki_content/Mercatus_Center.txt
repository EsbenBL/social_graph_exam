It works with policy experts, [[lobbyist]]s, and government officials to connect academic learning and real-world practice.

According to the ''2017 Global Go To [[Think Tank]] Index Report'' ([[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program]], [[University of Pennsylvania]]), Mercatus is number 39 in the "Top Think Tanks in the United States" and number 18 of the "Best University Affiliated Think Tanks".<ref name="Global Go To">{{cite web|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=think_tanks|title=2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report|author=McGann|first=James|date=January 31, 2018}}</ref> The [[Koch family]] has been a major financial supporter of the organization since the mid-1980s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2004/07/15/5967/kochs-low-profile-belies-political-power|title=Koch's low profile belies political power|date=2004-07-15|website=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref><ref name="Kamen">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/11/AR2006071101155.html|title=I Am OMB and I Write the Rules|last=Kamen|first=Al|date=July 12, 2006|work=Washington Post|page=A13}}</ref> [[Charles Koch]] serves on the group's board of directors.<ref name="mayer2010" /><ref name=":0" />

==History==
The Mercatus Center was founded by [[Richard Fink]] as the Center for the Study of Market Processes at [[Rutgers University]]. After the Koch family gave more than $30 million to George Mason University,<ref name="mayer2010"/> the Center moved there in the mid-1980s. It took its current name in 1999.<ref name="mayer2010">{{cite news | first = Jane | last = Mayer | title = Covert Operations: The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama. | date = 2010-08-30 | publisher = [[Condé Nast Publications]] | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all | work = [[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>

The Mercatus Center is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit and does not receive support from George Mason University or any federal, state, or local governments.

==Mission==
The organization describes itself as "the world's premier university source for market-oriented ideas" and says it aims to bridge "the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."<ref name="mayer2010"/> By advancing knowledge about how markets can work to improve lives and individual freedoms, by training graduate students, conducting research, and applying economic principles, they hope to offer solutions to society's most pressing problems.

Mercatus currently runs the following research programs: The Project for the Study of American Capitalism; Technology Policy Project; State and Local Policy Project; Spending and Budget Initiative; Program on the American Economy and Globalization; Program on Monetary Policy; Program on Financial Regulation; and Program for Economic Research on Regulation.<ref name="Programs">{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercatus.org/programs|title=Programs|work=Mercatus Center|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}</ref>

Rob Stein, a Democratic strategist, has called Mercatus "ground zero for [[deregulation]] policy in Washington."<ref name="mayer2010"/> The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' has called the Mercatus Center "the most important think tank you've never heard of".<ref name="mayer2010"/>

==Activities==
In 2018, Mercatus announced<ref>[https://www.mercatus.org/features/mercatus-announces-futures-market-forecast-nominal-gdp announced]</ref> that it "sponsored the development of a [[Futures exchange|futures market]] based on [nominal gross domestic product] contracts with Hypermind, a UK-based [[prediction market]]." As explained in the announcement: "Mercatus Center's [[Scott Sumner]] and David Beckworth have made the case that an alternative [[monetary policy]] approach, ''[[Nominal income target|nominal gross domestic product (NGDP) level targeting]]'', is superior to [[inflation targeting]]. NGDP is essentially the nation's total income. According to Sumner and Beckworth, instead of targeting inflation (general prices), the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]]'s monetary policy should target the rate at which the nation's total income is expected to grow. NGDP level targeting will ensure that the right amount of money supply is provided to meet the economy's needs."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercatus.org/features/mercatus-announces-futures-market-forecast-nominal-gdp|title=Mercatus Announces Futures Market to Forecast Nominal GDP|date=2017-09-19|work=Mercatus Center|access-date=9 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>

In 2016, Mercatus launched its Program on the American Economy and Globalization,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cafehayek.com/2016/05/program-on-the-american-economy-and-globalization.html|title=Program on the American Economy and Globalization - Cafe Hayek|website=cafehayek.com|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2018|date=2016-05-04}}</ref> run by [[Daniel T. Griswold|Daniel Griswold]], which aims to help "the public and policymakers understand the benefits of an economy free from [[Protectionism|protectionist]] barriers against the international movement of goods, services, capital, ideas, and people."<ref name="Programs"/>

In 2015, Mercatus launched its annual Ranking of the 50 States by Fiscal Conditions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercatus.org/statefiscalrankings-2015-edition|title=Ranking the States by Fiscal Condition|date=2015-06-29|work=Mercatus Center|access-date=9 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Also in 2015, Mercatus started its Program on Monetary Policy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mises.org/wire/mercatus-centers-new-program-monetary-policy|title=Mercatus Center's New Program on Monetary Policy {{!}} Joseph T.

In 2012, Mercatus scholar [[Charles Blahous]] released a study saying that the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) would worsen the federal deficit, contrary to the official [[Congressional Budget Office]] forecast.<ref name="washpo">{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Lori|title=Health-care law will add $340 billion to deficit, new study finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/health-care-law-will-add-340-billion-to-deficit-new-study-finds/2012/04/09/gIQAti1o6S_story.html|access-date=10 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 April 2012}}</ref> The study was generally criticized by supporters of the PPACA.<ref>{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Ezra|title=The bizarre baseline games you need to play to make Obamacare increase the deficit|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-weird-baseline-obamacares-opponents-are-using/2012/04/10/gIQAu3de8S_blog.html|access-date=10 July 2012|work=The Washington Post|date=10 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Spross|first=Jeff|title=Charles Blahous' Absurd 'New Math' In A Chart|url=http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/04/11/462437/charles-balhous-absurd-new-math-in-a-chart/|access-date=10 July 2012}}</ref> [[Jeanne Lambrew]], deputy assistant to the president for health policy, wrote, "This new math fits the old pattern of mischaracterizations about the Affordable Care Act when official estimates show the health care law reduces the deficit."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambrew|first=Jeanne|title=Official Sources Agree: The Affordable Care Act Reduces the Deficit|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/04/09/official-sources-agree-affordable-care-act-reduces-deficit|via=[[NARA|National Archives]]|work=[[whitehouse.gov]]|access-date=10 July 2012}}</ref> Blahous defended the findings of his research.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blahous|first=Charles|title=Why Obamacare Expands the Deficit: Charles Blahous Rebuts His Critics|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/04/11/why-obamacare-expands-the-deficit-charles-blahous-rebuts-his-critics/|work=Forbes.com|access-date=10 July 2012|date=11 April 2012}}</ref>

In 2010, the center collaborated with EconStories to produce a parody rap video about the conflict of ideas between [[F. A. Hayek]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]].<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|title="Fear the Boom and Bust" a Hayek vs. Keynes Rap Anthem |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk|access-date=10 July 2012}}</ref> A sequel, "Fight of the Century", was produced in 2011.<ref name="http">{{cite web|title="Fight of the Century" Keynes vs Hayek Round 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQnarzmTOc&feature=fvwrel|access-date=10 July 2012}}</ref>
