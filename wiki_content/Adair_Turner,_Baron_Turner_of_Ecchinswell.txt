His father Geoffrey was a [[University of Liverpool]]-educated [[Urban planner|town planner]]). Adair attended [[Hutchesons' Grammar School]] in [[Glasgow]], then moved to [[Glenalmond College]].

==Business career==

He taught economics part-time after university.  His career with [[BP]] started in 1979 and he worked for [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan Bank]] from 1979 to 1982.  He became a director of [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey & Co]] in 1994 after joining in 1982.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/491053.stm | work=BBC News | title=Adair Turner answers your questions | date=28 October 1999}}</ref> Turner was Director-General of the [[Confederation of British Industry]] (CBI) from 1995 to 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8cc50f14-88a1-11e1-9b8d-00144feab49a.html|title=Favourites line up for beefier BoE|author1=Chris Giles|author2=Brooke Masters|author3=Patrick Jenkins|newspaper=Financial Times|date=17 April 2012|access-date=18 April 2012}} {{paywall}}</ref> In this role he became one of the leading proponents of British membership of the euro – a stance he later said was mistaken.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jill Treanor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/22/eurozone-crisis-fsa-lord-turner |title=Eurozone crisis will be solved – eventually – insists FSA's Lord Turner &#124; Business &#124; The Observer |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2014-05-07}}</ref> From 2000 to 2006 he was Vice-Chairman of [[Merrill Lynch]] Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/Pages/About/Who/board/turner.shtml |title=Biography of Lord Adair Turner |publisher=Fsa.gov.uk |date=2012-11-21 |access-date=2014-05-07}}</ref>

He lectures part-time at the [[London School of Economics]], where in 2010 he delivered three lectures on "Economics after the Crisis", later published by MIT Press as a book under that title: this criticised conventional wisdom that the object of policy should be to maximise GDP, that the way to do this is to promote freer markets, and that inequality is an acceptable price for growth.<ref>See review by Robert Skidelsky in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' 28 September 2012, pp. 9–10.</ref>

In 2002, he chaired a UK government enquiry into pensions. In 2007, he succeeded [[Frances Cairncross]] as Chairman of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] and [[Baroness Jay]] as Chair of the [[Overseas Development Institute]]'s Council.

In 2008 his ''Building a Low-carbon Economy'' (co-written with [[David Kennedy (economist)|David Kennedy]]) was published, and the same year Turner was appointed as first Chairman of the British Government's newly established [[Committee on Climate Change]]. He stepped down from this position in Spring 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2134109/lord-turner-step-chair-climate-committee |title=Lord Turner to step down as chairman of climate committee – 21 Dec 2011 – News from |publisher=BusinessGreen |date=2011-12-21 |access-date=2014-05-07}}</ref>

On 29 May 2008, it was announced that he would take over as Chairman of the [[Financial Services Authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4029748.ece |title=Lord Turner confirmed chairman of FSA in its hour of need |publisher=Business.timesonline.co.uk |access-date=2014-05-07}}</ref> He took up this post on 20 September 2008 for a five-year term to succeed [[Callum McCarthy]].

==Financial Services Authority==
Turner defended the actions of the regulator on the [[BBC]]'s Andrew Marr show on 15 February 2009, saying that other regulatory bodies throughout the world, which varied in structure and lightness of regulatory touch, also failed to predict the economic collapse. He said that in line with other regulators the FSA had failed intellectually by focusing too much on processes and procedures rather than looking at the bigger economic picture. Asked why [[Sir James Crosby]] had been appointed deputy chairman when the FSA had said that his bank [[HBOS]] was using risky lending practices, Lord Turner said that they had files on almost every financial institution indicating a degree of risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5738444.ece |title=FSA chairman Lord Turner: we got it wrong but we'll keep our bonuses |publisher=Business.timesonline.co.uk |access-date=2014-05-07}}</ref>

He did not apologise for the actions of the FSA, which had presided over the near-total collapse of several major banks, and accepted that it had not foreseen the consequences for Lloyds Bank of its merger with the ailing HBOS in September 2008. Despite controversy over bonuses for employees of Lloyds, he sought to justify bonuses averaging 15 per cent for his own 2,500 staff, arguing "If you're saying we should now cut the bonuses [of FSA employees], you're saying you should cut their pay by 15%".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7891171.stm | work=BBC News | title='Not surprised' by HBOS losses | date=15 February 2009}}</ref>

In August 2009 in an interview for ''[[Prospect magazine|Prospect]]'' magazine he supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions (the  "[[Tobin tax]]"), warning that a "swollen" financial sector paying excessive salaries had grown too big for society.<ref>''Financial Times'', 27 August 2009 (www.ft.com).</ref>

==[[Institute for New Economic Thinking]]==
In April 2013, it was announced that Lord Turner would be joining [[George Soros]]' economic think tank as a senior research fellow in its London offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/87071983/ex-fsa-chairman-joins-soros-funded-think-tank |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030854/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/87071983/ex-fsa-chairman-joins-soros-funded-think-tank |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-05-08 |title=Ex-FSA chairman joins Soros-funded think-tank – Tags: TURNER, Adair, 1955– INVESTMENT advisors |publisher=Connection.ebscohost.com |access-date=2014-05-07}}</ref> From that, he wrote a book "Between Debt and the Devil: Money, Credit, and Fixing Global Finance" Princeton University Press, 2016 {{ISBN|9781400873326}}

==Global Apollo Programme==
In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the [[Global Apollo Programme]], which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make [[Renewable energy|carbon-free]] [[Base load power plant|baseload electricity]] less costly than [[Fossil fuel power station|electricity from coal]] by the year 2025.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Carrington|first1=Damian|title=Global Apollo programme seeks to make clean energy cheaper than coal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/apollo-programme-for-clean-energy-needed-to-tackle-climate-change|access-date=2 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|issue=2 June 2015|publisher=[[Guardian News Media]]}}</ref>

==Honoured==
On 7 September 2005 he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Turner of Ecchinswell''', of [[Ecchinswell]] in the [[Hampshire|County of Hampshire]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=57754 |date=12 September 2005 |page=11717}}</ref> awarded in recognition of his public service to the nation (he has a cottage in Ecchinswell).

==Personal life==

She was [https://web.archive.org/web/20080214093831/http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/Aboutus/council.html Chair] of the council of the [[Soil Association]] and a [[non-executive director]] of [[Northern Foods]].
