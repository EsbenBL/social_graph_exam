'''Clare W. Graves''' (December 21, 1914 – January 3, 1986) was a professor of [[psychology]] and originator of the ''[[Graves's emergent cyclical levels of existence|emergent cyclical theory]]'' of adult [[Developmental psychology|human development]], aspects of which were later popularised as ''[[Spiral Dynamics]]''. He was born in [[New Richmond, Indiana]].<ref>{{cite news|date=16 Jan 1986 |title=In Memoriam... |url=https://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn96027707/1986-01-16/ed-1/seq-4/ |work=The Concordiensis |location=Union College, Schenectady, NY |access-date=2 Aug 2020}}</ref>

==Education and academic career==
Graves graduated from [[Union College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1940 and received his master's degree and PhD<ref>{{cite thesis|type=PhD |last=Graves |first=Clare W. |date=1945 |publisher=Western Reserve University |title=A Study of the Genesis and Dynamics of Psychopathic Personality as Revealed By Combining The Clinical Case History and Experimental Approaches |oclc=45432163}}</ref> in psychology in 1943 and 1945, respectively, from [[Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].  He taught at Western Reserve for three years before returning to Union College as an Associate Professor in 1948.  He was promoted to full Professor in 1956, and retired in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|editor1-last=Cowan |editor1-first=Christopher |editor2-last=Todorovic |editor2-first=Natasha |editor3-last=Lee |editor3-first=William R. |url=http://www.clarewgraves.com/source_content/biography.htm |website=Clare W. Graves |title=About Dr. Graves... |access-date=2 Aug 2020}}</ref>

In 1975, [[Don Edward Beck]], a professor at North Texas University, sought Graves out on the basis of his 1974 article in ''The Futurist.''  By this point, Graves's health was declining, and Beck resolved to record Graves's knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krumm |first1=Rainer |last2=Parstorfer |first2=Benedikt |title=Clare W. Graves, Sein Leben sein Werk |publisher=Werdewelt Verlag |date=10 Oct 2014 |language=de |isbn=978-3981531886 |pages=v, 1–2}}</ref>  They were later joined by Christopher Cowan, with whom Beck developed [[Spiral Dynamics]] as an extension of Graves's work.  After Graves's death, Cowan, his consulting partner Natasha Todorovic, and archivist William R. Lee, became custodians of Graves's work, maintaining the [http://www.clarewgraves.com/home.html official Clare W. Graves website], which provides access to some of those materials.<ref>[[#CITEREFButters2015|Butters (2015)]], p. 71</ref>

==Emergent cyclical theory==
{{anchor|The Emergent Cyclical Levels of Existence Theory}}
{{Main|Emergent cyclical theory}}

In the early mid-twentieth century, Graves decided to conduct experiments that he hoped would reconcile the various approaches to human nature and questions about psychological maturity,<ref>[[#CITEREFRice2018|Rice (2018)]], para. 5</ref> as he saw elements of truth and error in all theories known at the time.<ref>[[#CITEREFGraves2005|Graves (2005)]], pp. 14, 32-42</ref>  Rather than construct a hypothesis about how the conflicting systems could be resolved, Graves posed several open-ended questions and looked to see what patterns would emerge from his data.  While not typical at the time, these approaches would later become known as [[grounded theory]] and inductive [[thematic analysis]].<ref>[[#CITEREFRice2018|Rice (2018)]], paras. 5, 7</ref>

Based on data collected over the next several decades, Graves observed that the [[emergence]] within humans of new bio-psycho-social systems in response to the interplay of external conditions with [[Neuroscience|neurology]] follows a [[hierarchy]] in several dimensions, though without guarantees as to time lines or even direction: both progression and regression are possibilities in his model. Furthermore, each level in the hierarchy alternates as the human is either trying to make the [[Natural environment|environment]] adapt to the [[self (psychology)|self]], or the human is adapting the self to the [[Existentialism|existential]] conditions. He called these 'express self' and 'deny self' systems, and the swing between them is the cyclic aspect of his theory. Graves saw this process of stable plateaus interspersed with change intervals as never ending, up to the limits of the brain of ''Homo sapiens,'' something he viewed as far greater than we have yet imagined.<ref>[[#CITEREFGraves2005|Graves (2005)]], pp. 184-191</ref>

==Influence==

Through his emergent cyclical theory, Graves has primarily been influential in the area of management theory, both during his lifetime and continuing into more recent years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beck |first=Arthur C. |collaboration=Staff of the Institute for Business and Community Development, University of Richmond |editor1-last=Beck |editor1-first=Arthur C. |editor2-last=Hillmar |editor2-first=Ellis D. |chapter=Clare W.

While sometimes cited in the context of developmental psychology,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cook‐Greuter |first=Susanne R. |date=1 December 2004 |title=Making the Case for a Developmental Perspective |journal=Industrial and Commercial Training |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=275–276 |doi=10.1108/00197850410563902 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Loevinger |first=Jane |title=Ego Development: Questions of Method and Theory |journal=Psychological Inquiry |year=1993 |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=58 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0401_12}}</ref> Graves is not broadly influential within developmental psychology academia.<ref>[[#CITEREFReitter2018|Reitter (2018)]], pp. 43–44</ref>  Graves has been criticized for not fully publishing his theory and data, with one source observing that by "leaving his legacy in not-quite-finished form, and in cultivating followers who have elaborated his ideas leaving them essentially unquestioned, [Graves] appears to have succeeded in leaving us a provocative and important theory, while so far avoiding anything like a debate about its merits."<ref>[[#CITEREFReitter2018|Reitter (2018)]], p. 1</ref>

Graves's ideas gained a broader audience through non-academic publications, most notably a 1974 article in ''The Futurist'' which attracted the attention of those who later created Spiral Dynamics.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Beck |editor-first=Don |last=Beck |first=Don |title=Spiral Dynamics in Action: Humanity's Master Code |chapter=Preface |page=viii |date=29 May 2018 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |place=Chester, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1119387183}}</ref> Graves influenced Ken Wilber's [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral philosophy]] both directly and [[Spiral Dynamics#Influence|through Spiral Dynamics]].<ref name="integral1" /><ref name="integral2" />  Through Spiral Dynamics, he has also influenced [[metamodernism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Freinacht |first=Hanzi |title=The Listening Society: A Metamodern Guide to Politics, Book One |page=171 |date=10 Mar 2017 |publisher=Metamoderna |isbn= 978-8799973903}}</ref>

==Works==
Graves worked towards a book describing his theories, but published few articles and gave few public talks on his work during his lifetime.  A full chronological bibliography is available online;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clarewgraves.com/source_content/chron.html |editor-last1=Lee |editor-first1=William R. |editor-last2=Cowan |editor-first2=Christopher C. |editor-last3=Todorovic |editor-first3=Natasha |title=Chronology of Publications and Articles by Dr. Graves |access-date=3 Aug 2020}}</ref> a selection of his most notable publications is provided below.

Graves was reportedly distressed by the poor reception given to Abraham Maslow at an [[American Psychological Association]] seminar in the mid 1950s<ref>[[#CITEREFCowanTodorovic2005|Cowan and Todorovic (2005)]], p. iv</ref> and determined not to publish his full theory until he was confident he could defend it.<ref>[[#CITEREFGraves2005|Graves (2005)]], pp. 5-6</ref>  Due to a brain injury sustained in 1975,<ref>[[#CITEREFGraves2005|Graves (2005)]], p. 5</ref> Graves abandoned his book manuscript in 1977.<ref>[[#CITEREFCowanTodorovic2005|Cowan and Todorovic (2005)]], p. v</ref>  The manuscript, consisting of largely complete drafts of sections describing the derivation of the theory from experimental data, and comparing it to other theories, was edited together with other primary sources to reconstruct the missing section on the nature of the levels, and published posthumously in 2005 as ''The Never Ending Quest''.<ref>[[#CITEREFCowanTodorovic2005|Cowan and Todorovic (2005)]], pp. v-x</ref>

Additionally, an edited transcription of a seminar given by Graves at the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1971, along with a reprint of his 1970 article in the Fall 1970 issue of the ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology'', were collected and published in book form in 2004 as ''Levels of Human Existence''.
