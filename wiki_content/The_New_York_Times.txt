In 1852, the newspaper started a western division, '''''The Times of California''''', which arrived whenever a [[mail boat]] from New York docked in [[California]].

On September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to '''''The New-York Times'''''. The hyphen in the city name was dropped on December 1, 1896.<ref>[http://blog.nyhistory.org/it-can-hyphen-here-why-the-new-york-historical-society-includes-a-hyphen/ "It Can Hyphen Here: Why the New-York Historical Society Includes a Hyphen" » New-York Historical Society].

The main office of ''The New York Times'' was attacked during the [[New York City draft riots]]. The riots, sparked by the institution of a draft for the [[Union Army]], began on July 13, 1863.

The newspaper's influence grew in 1870 and 1871, when it published a series of exposés on [[William Magear Tweed|William Tweed]], leader of the city's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] — popularly known as "[[Tammany Hall]]" (from its early-19th-century meeting headquarters) — that led to the end of the Tweed Ring's domination of New York's City Hall.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=September 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1851.html |title=New York Times Timeline 1851–1880 |publisher=The New York Times Company |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914122138/http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1851.html |archive-date=September 14, 2008 }}</ref> Tweed had offered ''The New York Times'' five million dollars (equivalent to {{Inflation|US|5|1871|fmt=c}}{{nbsp}}million dollars in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to not publish the story.<ref name="happy 200" />

=== Ochs era ===
After George Jones died in 1891, [[Charles Ransom Miller]] and other ''New York Times'' editors raised $1&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1|1891|r=0}} million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to buy the ''Times'', printing it under the '''New York Times Publishing Company'''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CCX2840800221| title=The New York Times Company| editor-last=Hast| editor-first=Adele| date=1991| work=International Directory of Company Histories| volume=4| pages=647–649| publisher=Gale| access-date=September 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBU7AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA8| title=Death Claims Veteran Editor of Times At New York Home| journal=Editor & Publisher| date=July 22, 1922| page=8| volume=55| number=8| access-date=September 20, 2020}}</ref> However, the newspaper found itself in a financial crisis by the [[Panic of 1893]],<ref name="Davis1921 3" /> and by 1896, the newspaper had a circulation of less than 9,000 and was losing $1,000 a day.

Shortly after assuming control of the paper, Ochs coined the paper's slogan, "All The News That's Fit To Print".

In it, the United States Supreme Court established the "[[actual malice]]" standard for press reports about public officials or [[public figure]]s to be considered [[defamation|defamatory]] or [[libel]]ous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case to prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in [[Recklessness (law)|reckless disregard]] of its truth or falsity. Because of the high [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] on the plaintiff, and difficulty proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.<ref>{{cite court| litigants=New York Times Co. v.

===The ''Pentagon Papers'' (1971)===
{{Main|Pentagon Papers}}
In 1971, the ''Pentagon Papers'', a secret [[United States Department of Defense]] history of the United States' political and military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to [[Neil Sheehan]] of ''The New York Times'' by former [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official [[Daniel Ellsberg]], with his friend [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]] assisting in copying them. ''The New York Times'' began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting airstrikes over [[Laos]], raids along the coast of [[North Vietnam]], and offensive actions were taken by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] well before the public was told about the actions, all while President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the [[credibility gap]] for the [[U.S. government]], and hurt efforts by the [[Nixon administration]] to fight the ongoing war.<ref name="nytpentagon">{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/pentagon_papers/index.html| title=Pentagon Papers| last=Cohen| first=Noam| work=The New York Times| access-date=September 18, 2008}}</ref>

When ''The New York Times'' began publishing its series, President [[Richard Nixon]] became incensed. His words to [[National Security]] Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] included "People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing" and "Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html| title=Audio Tapes from the Nixon White House| publisher=[[National Security Archive]]| access-date=January 20, 2009}}</ref> After failing to get ''The New York Times'' to stop publishing, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that ''The New York Times'' cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system.

On June 18, 1971, ''The Washington Post'' began publishing its own series. [[Ben Bagdikian]], a ''Post'' editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the ''Post'' received a call from [[William Rehnquist]], an assistant U.S. Attorney General for the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], asking them to stop publishing. When the ''Post'' refused, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] sought another injunction. The [[United States district court|U.S. District court]] judge refused, and the government appealed.

On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]''.<ref>{{ussc|name=New York Times Co. v. United States|volume=403|page=713|year=1971}}</ref> On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] enshrines an absolute [[Freedom of speech|right to free speech]], many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of [[national security]] were at stake.<ref name="nytpentagon" />

=== Late 1970s–1990s ===
In the 1970s, the paper introduced a number of new lifestyle sections, including Weekend and Home, with the aim of attracting more advertisers and readers. Many criticized the move for betraying the paper's mission.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/new-york-times-digital-journalism/| title=How The New York Times Is Clawing Its Way into the Future| last=Snyder| first=Gabriel| date=February 2017| work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]| access-date=November 5, 2017}}</ref> On September 7, 1976, the paper switched from an eight-column format to a six-column format.

''The New York Times'' switched to a digital production process sometime before 1980, but only began preserving the resulting digital text that year.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/panel-the-future-of-the-past-modernizing-the-new-york-times-archive| title=Panel: The future of the past: Modernizing The New York Times archive| date=July 12, 2012| website=Reynolds Journalism Institute| access-date=December 11, 2017}}</ref> In 1983, the ''Times'' sold the electronic rights to its articles to [[LexisNexis]]. As the online distribution of news increased in the 1990s, the ''Times'' decided not to renew the deal and in 1994 the newspaper regained electronic rights to its articles.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/03/business/times-co-regains-control-of-electronic-rights-to-paper.html| title=Times Co.

==== 2000s ====
In August 2007, the paper reduced the physical size of its print edition, cutting the page width from {{convert|13.5|in|cm}} to a {{convert|12|in|cm}}. This followed similar moves by a roster of other newspapers in the previous ten years, including ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The move resulted in a 5% reduction in news space, but (in an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses) also saved about $12 million a year.<ref name=observer1>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2014/07/seinfeld-is-becoming-a-smart-phone-using-binge-watching-millennial/|title=New York Times to Cut Size 5 Percent; Keller Says Paper Better Off Smaller &#124; the ''New York Observer''|date=July 17, 2006|work=The New York Observer|access-date=September 15, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=38405&c=1|title=New York Times trims paper size to cut costs|date=August 7, 2007|work=Press Gazette|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228002638/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=38405&c=1|archive-date=December 28, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=September 18, 2008}}</ref>

In September 2008, ''The New York Times'' announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the [[New York metropolitan area]].<ref name=observer1 /> The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, while Sports continues to be printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the Metro section called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by ''The New York Times'' can allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper includes more than four sections on all days except for Saturday, the sections were required to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes allowed ''The New York Times'' to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. ''The New York Times''{{'}} announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions would remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.<ref name="Pérez-Peña, Richard" />

Because of its declining sales largely attributed to the rise of online news sources, favored especially by younger readers, and the decline of advertising revenue, the newspaper had been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses,<ref name="TimesCuts500">{{cite web |url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2005/09/new_york_times_fires_500_staffers/ |title=New York Times Fires 500 Staffers|last=Joyner|first=James|publisher=Outside the Beltway|access-date=July 4, 2006|date=September 21, 2005}}</ref> in common with a general trend among print news media. Following industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/business/media/27audit.html|title=U.S. Newspaper Circulation Falls 10%|author=Perez-Peña, Richard|date=October 26, 2009|work=The New York Times|author-link=Richard Pérez-Peña}}</ref>

In 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area. Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page "Bay Area" insert was added to copies of the [[Northern California]] edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.

==== 2010s ====
In December 2012, the ''Times'' published "[[Snow Fall]]", a six-part article about the [[2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche]] which integrated videos, photos, and interactive graphics and was hailed as a watershed moment for online journalism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://niemanstoryboard.org/stories/inside-snow-fall-the-new-york-times-multimedia-storytelling-sensation/|title=Inside "Snow Fall," the New York Times multimedia storytelling sensation|last=Williams|first=Paige|date=March 29, 2013|work=Nieman Storyboard |access-date=April 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/12/new-york-times-snow-fall-feature/320253/|title=What the New York Times's 'Snow Fall' Means to Online Journalism's Future|last=Greenfield|first=Rebecca|date=December 20, 2012|work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref>

In 2016, reporters for the newspaper were reportedly the target of [[cybersecurity]] breaches. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was reportedly investigating the attacks. The cybersecurity breaches have been described as possibly being related to [[cyberattack]]s that targeted other institutions, such as the [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|Democratic National Committee]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/russia-hack-new-york-times-fbi/index.html|title=FBI investigating Russian hack of New York Times reporters, others|date=August 23, 2016|publisher=CNN|last2=Prokupecz|first2=Shimon|last1=Perez|first1=Evan|access-date=August 23, 2016}}</ref>

During the 2016 presidential election, the ''Times'' played an important role in elevating the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|Hillary Clinton emails controversy]] into the most important subject of media coverage in the election which Clinton would lose narrowly to Donald Trump.

In October 2018, the ''Times'' published a 14,218-word investigation into [[Donald Trump]]'s "self-made" fortune and [[Tax returns of Donald Trump|tax avoidance]], an 18-month project based on examination of 100,000 pages of documents.

The newspaper's first building was located at 113 [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] in New York City.

===Gender discrimination in employment===
[[Employment discrimination|Discriminatory]] practices used by the paper long restricted women in appointments to editorial positions. The newspaper's first general female reporter was [[Jane Grant]], who described her experience afterward: "In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable [[hazing]]. Because of her [[Sex and gender distinction|gender]], any promotion was out of the question, according to the then-managing editor. She remained on the staff for fifteen years, interrupted by World War I.<ref>Grant, Jane, ''Confession of a Feminist'', in ''[[The American Mercury]]'', vol. LVII, no. 240, Dec. 1943 (microfilm), pp. 684–691, esp. pp. 684–686.</ref>

In 1935, [[Anne McCormick]] wrote to [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]]: "I hope you won't expect me to revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff."<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and ''The New York Times (N.Y.: Random House, [2nd printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-394-58452-X}})), p. 35.</ref> Later, she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues.

Covering world leaders' speeches after [[World War II]] at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] was limited to men by a club rule. When women were eventually allowed to hear the speeches directly, they were still not allowed to ask the speakers questions. However, men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work.<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', pp. 100–101.</ref> ''Times'' reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the club after covering one speech on assignment.<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', pp. 101–102.</ref> [[Nan C. Robertson|Nan Robertson]]'s article on the [[Union Stock Yards]], [[Chicago]], was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said: "'It will come as a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a ''girl,''{{'}} he began... [G]asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'"<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', p. 76 (italics in original).</ref> ''The New York Times'' hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', where "[s]he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs."<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', p. 61.</ref>

=== Slogan ===
''The New York Times'' has had one slogan. Since 1896, the newspaper's slogan has been "All the News That's Fit to Print." In 1896, [[Adolph Ochs]] held a competition to attempt to find a replacement slogan, offering a $100 prize for the best one. Though he later announced that the original would not be changed, the prize would still be awarded. Entries included "News, Not Nausea"; "In One Word: Adequate"; "News Without Noise"; "Out Heralds ''[[The New York Herald|The Herald]]'', Informs ''[[New York World|The World]]'', and Extinguishes ''[[The Sun (New York City)|The Sun]]''"; "The Public Press is a Public Trust"; and the winner of the competition, "All the world's news, but not a school for scandal."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/insider/1896-news-not-nausea.html|title=1896 {{!}} 'News, Not Nausea'| last=Dunlap| first=David W.| date=January 5, 2017| work=The New York Times| access-date=March 14, 2017| issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-16918787| title=Story of the most famous seven words in US journalism| last=Campbell| first=Professor W.

=== Ochs-Sulzberger family ===
In 1896, Adolph Ochs bought ''The New York Times'', a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned ''The New York Times'' ever since.<ref name="nyt1881" /> The publisher [[Initial public offering|went public]] on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the [[American Stock Exchange LLC|American Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/nytlucey.htm|title=The New York Times: A Chronology: 1851-2010|last=Lucey|first=Bill|website=New York State Library|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225020720/http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/nytlucey.htm|archive-date=February 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B [[Voting interest|voting shares]]. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights, while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.

The Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., and Cathy J. Sulzberger.<ref>{{cite news|title=How a Money Manager Battled New York Times |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 21, 2007 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117441975619343135 |access-date=September 16, 2008 |first=Sarah |last=Ellison |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328181845/http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117441975619343135-nb3xaCqDA7AjGYGGjWb0pkAVzt8_20080320.html |archive-date=March 28, 2007 }}</ref>

[[Turner Catledge]], the top editor at ''The New York Times'' from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos, he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos, it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.<ref>Chomsky, Daniel (2006) {{"'}}An Interested Reader': Measuring Ownership Control at the New York Times", ''Critical Studies in Media Communication'', 23(1): 1–18</ref>

===Public editors===
The position of public editor was established in 2003 to "investigate matters of journalistic integrity"; each public editor was to serve a two-year term.<ref name="public">{{cite news|url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/shonda-rhimes-alessandra-stanley-margaret-sullivan-column/|title=Diversity, Strong Editing and Moving Forward From the Shonda Rhimes Furor|last=Sullivan|first=Margaret|date=September 24, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 28, 2014|quote=Margaret Sullivan is the fifth public editor appointed by The New York Times. ...

===Style===
Unlike most U.S. daily newspapers, the ''Times'' relies on its own in-house [[stylebook]] rather than [[AP Stylebook|The Associated Press Stylebook]]. When referring to people, ''The New York Times'' generally uses [[honorific]]s rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, pop culture coverage,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://observer.com/2018/10/new-york-times-drops-pop-culture-honorifics/|title=New York Times (Sort of) Removes Honorifics From Pop Culture Stories|date=October 9, 2018|website=Observer|language=en|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref> Book Review and Magazine).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/a-question-of-honorifics/|title=A Question of Honorifics|last=Hoyt|first=Clark|newspaper=The New York Times-Public Editor's Journal|language=en|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref>

In August 2014, the ''Times'' decided to use the word "[[torture]]" to describe incidents in which interrogators "inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information." This was a shift from the paper's previous practice of describing such practices as "harsh" or "brutal" interrogations.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Byers| first1=Dylan| title=N.Y.

Then-''Times'' politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: "It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length." Ryan said the paper ultimately decided to publish it because of its news value and because "[t]o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/new-york-times-cnn-report-trumps-vulgarities-in-full-229330 |title=New York Times, CNN report Trump's vulgarities in full |work=Politico |date=October 7, 2016 |first=Hadas |last=Gold}}</ref>

=== ''International Edition'' ===
''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'' is a print version of the paper tailored for readers outside the United States. Formerly a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' named '''The International Herald Tribune''', ''The New York Times'' took full ownership of the paper in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into its domestic operations.

==== Food section ====
The food section is supplemented on the web by properties for home cooks and for out-of-home dining. ''The New York Times'' Cooking (cooking.nytimes.com; also available via iOS app) provides access to more than 17,000 recipes on file {{as of|November 2016|lc=y}},<ref>{{cite web|date=November 16, 2016|title=iTunes Preview: NYT Cooking – Recipes from The New York Times|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nyt-cooking-recipes-from-new/id911422904?mt=8|access-date=November 28, 2016|website=itunes.apple.com|publisher=Apple Inc.}}</ref> and availability of saving recipes from other sites around the web. The newspaper's restaurant search (nytimes.com/reviews/dining) allows online readers to search NYC area restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, price, and reviewer rating. ''The New York Times'' has also published several cookbooks, including ''The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century'', published in late 2010.

==== ''TimesSelect'' ====
In September 2005, the paper decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns in a program known as ''TimesSelect'', which encompassed many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, ''TimesSelect'' cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year,<ref>{{cite news|access-date=September 15, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/membercenter/faq/timesselect.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions About TimesSelect |work=The New York Times}}</ref> though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty.<ref>{{cite news|access-date=September 15, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/faq/timesselecthdqa1.html|title=can I get TimesSelect for free |work=The New York Times |date=September 9, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|access-date=September 15, 2008 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_n26734102 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006144809/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_n26734102 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 6, 2008 |title=The New York Times Introduces TimesSelect University; Program Offers College Students and Faculty Special Access to TimesSelect |publisher=Business Wire |date=January 24, 2006 }}</ref> To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material,<ref name="WiredTimesSelectGoof">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/09/68938 |title=Goof Lets Times' Content Go Free |first=Cyrus |last=Farivar |date=September 22, 2006 |access-date=July 4, 2006 |work=Wired |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918060851/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/09/68938 |archive-date=September 18, 2008 }}</ref> and at least one site once compiled links of reprinted material.<ref name="NeverPayRetail">{{cite web |url=http://www.johntabin.com/neverpayretail/ |title=Never Pay Retail |last=Tabin |first=John |access-date=September 16, 2008 |work=John Tabin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916140755/http://johntabin.com/neverpayretail/ |archive-date=September 16, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On September 17, 2007, ''The New York Times'' announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.blorge.com/Structure:%20/2007/09/17/why-the-new-york-times-is-free/ |title=Why The New York Times is Free |access-date=September 16, 2008 |work=Blorge |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012062718/http://tech.blorge.com/Structure%3A%20/2007/09/17/why-the-new-york-times-is-free/ |archive-date=October 12, 2008 }}</ref>

''Times'' columnists including [[Nicholas Kristof]] and [[Thomas Friedman]] had criticized ''TimesSelect'',<ref name="SlateSuellontropScooplet">{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2143479 |title=Touting Mark Warner – Suellentrop's secret scooplet |journal=Slate |first=Mickey |last=Kaus |date=June 18, 2006 |access-date=September 16, 2008}}</ref> with Friedman going so far as to say "I hate it.

==== Paywall and digital subscriptions ====
In 2007, in addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, ''The New York Times'' news archives from 1987 to the present were made available at no charge to non-subscribers,<ref name="nyt1">{{cite news|last=Pérez-Peña|first=Richard|date=September 18, 2007|title=Times to Stop Charging for Parts of Its Web Site|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/media/18times.html |access-date=April 14, 2008}}</ref> as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain.<ref name="NYTArchiveSearch">{{cite news|last=Raab|first=Selwyn|title=Archive 1851–1980: Advanced Search|work=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/search/query?srchst=p|access-date=September 16, 2008}}</ref>

Falling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline resulted in a "metered [[paywall]]" being instituted in March 2011, limiting non-subscribers to a monthly allotment of 20 free on-line articles per month.<ref>{{cite news |title=NYTimes.com Paywall Picture About to Get Much Clearer |url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-nytimes.com-paywall-picture-about-to-get-much-clearer/ |first=Staci D. |last=Kramer |date=March 17, 2011 |access-date=March 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318175131/http://paidcontent.org/article/419-nytimes.com-paywall-picture-about-to-get-much-clearer/ |archive-date=March 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name="NYT20110317">{{cite news |title=A Letter to Our Readers About Digital Subscriptions |last=Sulzberger |first=Arthur Ochs Jr. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/opinion/l18times.html |date=March 17, 2011 |work=The New York Times |access-date=March 17, 2011}}</ref> This measure was regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100 million in revenue {{as of|2012|03|lc=y}}.<ref name="MDMMar12">{{cite news|title='NYT' Pay Wall Could Bring $100M Annually |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/169998/nyt-pay-wall-could-bring-100m-annually.html|access-date=March 13, 2012 |newspaper=Media Daily News |date=March 12, 2012|author= Sass, Erik}}</ref><ref name="Verge20to10">{{cite web |last1=D'Orazio |first1=Dante |title=The New York Times cuts free access to ten articles per month, has 454,000 paid digital subscribers |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/20/2887305/new-york-times-free-access-paywall-digital-subscribers |website=The Verge |access-date=24 July 2021 |language=en |date=20 March 2012}}</ref>

Beginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved from 20 to 10 articles per month.<ref name="Verge20to10" />  Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan allowed free access for occasional readers. Digital subscription rates for four weeks ranged from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99¢. Subscribers to the paper's print edition got full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts remained free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps. In January 2013, ''The New York Times''{{'}} [[Public Editor]] [[Margaret M. Sullivan]] announced that for the first time in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Milestone Behind, a Mountain Ahead |work=The New York Times |date=January 19, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/public-editor/a-milestone-behind-a-mountain-ahead.html |access-date=September 16, 2008 |first=Margaret |last=Sullivan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210911055529/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/public-editor/a-milestone-behind-a-mountain-ahead.html |archive-date=February 10, 2013}}</ref>

In 2010, ''The New York Times'' editors collaborated with students and faculty from [[New York University]]'s [[Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute|Studio 20 Journalism Masters]] program to launch and produce "The Local East Village", a [[hyperlocal]] blog designed to offer news "by, for and about the residents of the East Village".<ref>{{cite web|last=Roy|first=Jessica|date=February 22, 2010|title=NYU and New York Times Collaborate on East Village Local Blog|url=http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2010/02/22/nyu-and-new-york-times-collaborate-on-east-village-local-blog/|access-date=May 4, 2014|work=The Local East Village}}</ref> That same year, [[reCAPTCHA]] helped to digitize old editions of ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is reCAPTCHA?|url=http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524080223/http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html|archive-date=May 24, 2007|access-date=April 16, 2010|publisher=Recaptcha.net}}</ref>

==== The ''Times Reader'' ====
The ''Times Reader'' is a digital version of ''The New York Times'', created via a collaboration between the newspaper and [[Microsoft]]. ''Times Reader'' takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting, using a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] team. It was announced in [[Seattle]] in April 2006, by [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Tom Bodkin]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/technology/microsoft-software-will-let-times-readers-download-paper.html|title=Microsoft Software Will Let Times Readers Download Paper|last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|date=April 29, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=February 21, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

=== Non-English versions ===

==== ''The New York Times en Español'' (Spanish-language) ====
Between February 2016 and September 2019, ''The New York Times'' launched a standalone [[Spanish language]] edition, ''The New York Times en Español''. The Spanish-language version featured increased coverage of news and events in [[Latin America]] and [[Spain]]. The expansion into Spanish language news content allowed the newspaper to expand its audience into the [[Spanish speaking world]] and increase its revenue. The Spanish-language version was seen as a way to compete with the established [[El País]] newspaper of [[Spain]], which bills itself the "global newspaper in Spanish."<ref>García, Mario R.

In June 2012, ''The New York Times'' introduced its first official foreign-language variant, '''cn.nytimes.com''', a Chinese-language news site viewable in both [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]] and [[simplified Chinese characters]].

==Controversies==

{{main|List of controversies involving The New York Times}}

=== Holodomor Coverage and Pulitzer ===
The Times has been criticized for content written by [[Walter Duranty]], who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936, has been criticized for a series of stories in 1931 on the [[Soviet Union]] and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time; however, he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly [[Holodomor]], a famine in Soviet Ukraine in the 1930s in which he summarized Russian propaganda, and the ''Times'' published, as fact: "Conditions are bad, but there is no famine".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&q=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year%2C+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces&pg=PA573 |title=Assignment in Utopia |last=Lyons |first=Eugene |publisher=Greenwood Press Reprint |access-date= April 23, 2012|isbn=978-1-4128-1760-8 |year=1938|page=573 }}</ref><ref name="ConqRav">Conquest, R. <u>Reflections on a Ravaged Century</u>.

In 2003, after the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, the ''Times'' hired [[Mark von Hagen]], professor of Russian history at [[Columbia University]], to review Duranty's work. Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, "For the sake of The New York Times' honor, they should take the prize away."<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm "N.Y.

In that regard, the Board's view is similar to that of ''The New York Times'' itself...".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytco.com/company/prizes-awards/new-york-times-statement-about-1932-pulitzer-prize-awarded-to-walter-duranty/|title = New York Times Statement About 1932 Pulitzer Prize Awarded to Walter Duranty}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Statement Walter Duranty|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-walter-duranty|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-06|website=The Pulitzer Prizes}}</ref>

===World War II===
[[Jerold Auerbach]], a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellow]] and [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Lecturer]], wrote in ''Print to Fit, The New York Times, Zionism and Israel, 1896-2016''<ref>{{cite book|title=Print to Fit, The New York Times, Zionism and Israel, 1896-2016|last=Auerbach | first=Jerold |publisher= Academic Studies Press|year=2019|isbn=978-1-61811-898-1|location=Boston|author-link=Jerold Auerbach}}</ref> that it was of utmost importance to [[Adolph Ochs]], the first Jewish owner of the paper, that in spite of the persecution of Jews in Germany, ''The Times'', through its reporting, should never be classified as a "Jewish newspaper".<ref>{{cite book|title=Print to Fit, The New York Times, Zionism and Israel, 1896-2016|last=Auerbach | first=Jerold |publisher= Academic Studies Press |year=2019 |page=37 |isbn=978-1-61811-898-1|location=Boston|author-link=Jerold Auerbach}}</ref>

After Ochs' death in 1935, his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger became the publisher of ''The New York Times'' and maintained the understanding that no reporting should reflect on ''The Times'' as a Jewish newspaper. Sulzburger shared Ochs' concerns about the way Jews were perceived in American society. His apprehensions about judgement were manifested positively by his strong fidelity to the United States. At the same time, within the pages of ''The New York Times,'' Sulzburger refused to bring attention to Jews, including the refusal to identify Jews as major victims of Nazi genocide. Instead, many reports of Nazi-ordered slaughter identified Jewish victims as "persons." ''The Times'' even opposed the rescue of Jewish refugees.<ref>{{cite book|title=Print to Fit, The New York Times, Zionism and Israel, 1896-2016|last=Auerbach | first=Jerold |publisher= Academic Studies Press|year=2019|pages=38–39|isbn=978-1-61811-898-1|location=Boston|author-link=Jerold Auerbach}}</ref>

On November 14, 2001, in ''The New York Times''{{'}} 150th-anniversary issue, in an article entitled "Turning Away From the Holocaust," former executive editor [[Max Frankel]] wrote:
<blockquote> And then there was failure: none greater than the staggering, staining failure of ''The New York Times'' to depict Hitler's methodical extermination of the Jews of Europe as a horror beyond all other horrors in World War II – a Nazi war within the war crying out for illumination.<ref name="Frankel">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/specials/onefifty/20FRAN.html|title=Turning Away From the Holocaust|last=Frankel | first=Max |date=November 14, 2001|work=The New York Times|author-link=Max Frankel}}</ref> </blockquote>
According to Frankel, harsh judges of ''The New York Times'' "have blamed 'self-hating [[Jews]]' and '[[anti-Zionists]]' among the paper's owners and staff." Frankel responded to this criticism by describing the fragile sensibilities of the Jewish owners of ''The New York Times'':
<blockquote> Then, too, papers owned by Jewish families, like ''The Times'', were plainly afraid to have a society that was still widely anti-Semitic misread their passionate opposition to Hitler as a merely parochial cause. Even some leading Jewish groups hedged their appeals for rescue lest they be accused of wanting to divert wartime energies.

At ''The Times'', the reluctance to highlight the systematic slaughter of Jews was undoubtedly influenced by the views of the publisher, [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]]. He believed strongly and publicly that Judaism was a religion, not a race or nationality – that Jews should be separate only in the way they worshiped. He thought they needed no state or political and social institutions of their own. He went to great lengths to avoid having ''The Times'' branded a ''Jewish newspaper.'' He resented other publications for emphasizing the Jewishness of people in the news.<ref name="Frankel"/></blockquote>
In the same article, Frankel quotes [[Laurel Leff]], associate professor of journalism at [[Northeastern University]], who in 2000 had described how the newspaper downplayed [[Nazi Germany]]'s targeting of [[Jew]]s for [[Holocaust|genocide]].<ref name="laurelleff">{{cite journal |last1=Leff |first1=Laurel |title=A Tragic "Fight in the Family": The New York Times, Reform Judaism and the Holocaust |journal=American Jewish History |date=March 2000 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=3–51 |doi=10.1353/ajh.2000.0016 |s2cid=162283819 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/544 |access-date=24 July 2021 |issn=1086-3141}}</ref>
<blockquote>November 1942 was a critical month for American Jews. After several months of delay, the U.S. State Department had confirmed already published information that Germany was engaged in the systematic extermination of European Jews. Newspaper reports put the death toll at one million and described the "most ruthless methods," including mass gassings at special camps.<ref name="laurelleff" /></blockquote>
Yet at the beginning of November 1942, Sulzberger lobbied U.S. government officials against the founding of a homeland for Jews to escape to. The Times was silent on the matter of an increase in U.S. immigration quotas to permit more Jews to enter, and "actively supported the British Government's restriction on legal immigration to Palestine even as the persecution of Jews intensified".<ref name="laurelleff" /> Sulzberger described Jews as being of no more concern to Nazi Germany than Roman Catholic priests or Christian ministers, and that Jews certainly were not singled out for extermination.<ref name="laurelleff" />

Leff's 2005 book ''[[Buried by the Times]]'' documents the paper's tendency before, during, and after [[World War II]] to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of Sulzberger, concerning [[Jewishness]], [[antisemitism]], and [[Zionism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper|url=https://archive.org/details/buriedbytimeshol0000leff|url-access=registration|last=Leff|first=Laurel |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-81287-0|location=New York}}</ref>

===Accusations of liberal bias===
In mid-2004, the newspaper's then-public editor [[Daniel Okrent]], wrote an [[opinion piece]] in which he said that ''The New York Times'' did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and [[same-sex marriage]].<ref name="is it liberal?" /> He stated that this bias reflected the paper's [[cosmopolitanism]], which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City, writing that the coverage of the ''Times''{{'}}s Arts & Leisure; Culture; and the Sunday ''Times Magazine'' trend to the left.<ref name="is it liberal?" /><blockquote>If you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world.</blockquote>''Times'' public editor [[Arthur Brisbane]] wrote in 2012:<ref>Brisbane Arthur S., (August 25, 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/success-and-risk-as-the-times-transforms.html Success and Risk as The Times Transforms].</ref><blockquote>When The Times covers a national presidential campaign, I have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so.

A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The ''Times''{{'}}s score was comparable to that of ''[[USA Today]]''.<ref name="Pew" /> Media analyst [[Brooke Gladstone]] of WNYC's ''[[On the Media]]'', writing for ''The New York Times'', says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that "Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/11/11/why-has-trust-in-the-news-media-declined/trust-in-the-news-media-has-come-to-mean-affirmation |last=Gladstone |first=Brooke |title='Trust' in the News Media Has Come to Mean Affirmation |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 21, 2015}}</ref>
