== Origins ==
Gender as a subject of analysis noticeably increased in the mid-1990s in the study of international relations. At this time there was a significant focus on the ways in which conceptions of gender influenced language, policies, and processes occupying the international arena. The creation of the journal was a result of this feminist thinking building up in the areas of international politics. Key conferences that were a factor in perpetuating these ideals were the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in Cairo, the 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna, and the 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pettman |first=Jan Jindy |title=Tenth Anniversary Reflections: In the Beginning... |journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics |year=2009 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=2â€“9 |doi= 10.1080/14616740802567691|s2cid=144121141 }}</ref> At the 1996 meeting of the [[International Studies Association]], [[Routledge]] representatives approached members of the Feminist Theory and Gender Studies section (FTGS) with the idea of a feminist journal, modeled on the recently launched journal, ''[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]]''.

The establishment of the journal was a collaborative effort headed by Jan Jindy Pettman in 1999. The [[editorial board]] was envisioned to be culturally diverse, featuring scholars in different cultural and ethnicity groups with a wide range of geographic representation.
