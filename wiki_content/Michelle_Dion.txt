Dion's book, ''Workers and Welfare: Comparative Institutional Change in Twentieth-Century Mexico'', was published in 2010.<ref name=profile/> The book was reviewed as "the most comprehensive account of Mexico's welfare institutions and policies".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Maria Lorena |title=Review of Workers and Welfare: Comparative Institutional Change in Twentieth Century Mexico |journal=Contemporary Sociology |publisher=American Sociological Institution |volume=40 |number=2 |date=March 2011 |pages=169–170 |doi=10.1177/0094306110396847m|s2cid=143050633 }}</ref> The book analysed the development of Mexican social welfare policy over nine decades, focusing on the period since 1980, arguing that its evolution was a function both of coalitions of organised labour and also the creation of state institutions like enlarged state administrative capacity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Middlebrook |first=Kevin J. |title=Review of Workers and Welfare: Comparative Institutional Change in Twentieth Century Mexico |journal= Journal of Latin American Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=43 |number=1 |date=February 2011 |pages=165–167 |doi=10.1017/S0022216X10001902|s2cid=145631661 }}</ref>
