{{linguistics}}

'''Linguistics''' is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[language]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=On Language and Linguistics |first=Michael A.K. |last=Halliday |author-link=Michael Halliday |author2= Jonathan Webster | publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-8264-8824-4 |page=vii}}</ref> It encompasses the analysis of every aspect of language, as well as the methods for studying and modelling them.

The traditional areas of linguistic analysis include [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], [[morphology_(linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Linguistics|year=2010|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn =978-0-262-51370-8|url= https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |edition= 6th |author= Adrian Akmajian, Richard A. Demers, Ann K. Farmer, Robert M. Harnish|accessdate= 25 July 2012}}</ref> Each of these areas roughly corresponds to phenomena found in human linguistic systems: sounds (and gesture, in the case of signed languages), minimal units (words, morphemes), phrases and sentences, and meaning and use.

Linguistics studies these phenomena in diverse ways and from various perspectives. Theoretical linguistics (including traditional descriptive linguistics) is concerned with building models of these systems, their parts (ontologies), and their combinatorics. [[Psycholinguistics]] builds theories of the processing and production of all these phenomena. These phenomena may be studied synchronically or [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]] (through history), in monolinguals or polyglots, in children or adults, as they are acquired or statically, as abstract objects or as embodied cognitive structures, using texts (corpora) or through experimental elicitation, by gathering data mechanically, through fieldwork, or through introspective judgment tasks. Computational linguistics implements theoretical constructs to parse or produce natural language or homologues. [[Neurolinguistics]] investigates linguistic phenomena by experiments on actual brain responses involving linguistic stimuli.

Linguistics is related to philosophy of language, stylistics and rhetoric, [[semiotics]], [[lexicography]], and translation.

== Major subdisciplines ==

=== Historical linguistics ===
{{main|Historical linguistics}}
Historical linguistics is the study of language change, particularly with regards to a specific language or a group of languages. [[Western world|Western trends]] in historical linguistics date back to roughly the late 18th century, when the discipline grew out of [[philology]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7486-4601-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=391}}</ref> (the study of ancient texts and [[wikt:antiquity|antique]] documents).

Historical linguistics emerged as one of the first few sub-disciplines in the field, and was most widely practiced during the late 19th century.<ref>"The Idea System of the Early Comparative Grammarians." {{Cite book|title=Schools of Thought: The Development of Linguistics from Bopp to Saussure |last=Amsterdamska |first=Olga |year=1987 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-009-3759-8_2 |publisher=Springer, Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-009-3759-8 |pages=32–62 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-3759-8_2}}</ref> Despite a shift in focus in the twentieth century towards [[Formalism (linguistics)|formalism]] and [[generative grammar]], which studies the [[universal grammar|universal]] properties of language, historical research today still remains a significant field of linguistic inquiry. Subfields of the discipline include [[language change]] and [[grammaticalisation]].

Historical linguistics studies language change either [[diachronic_linguistics|diachronically]] (through a comparison of different time periods in the past and present) or in a [[synchronic_linguistics|synchronic]] manner (by observing developments between different variations that exist within the current linguistic stage of a language).

At first, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of [[comparative linguistics]], which involves a study of the relationship between different languages.<ref name="Routledge introduction">"Editors' Introduction: Foundations of the new historical linguistics." In. ''The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics'' Routledge p.&nbsp;25.</ref> During this time, scholars of historical linguistics were only concerned with creating different categories of [[Language family|language families]], and reconstructing [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] proto languages by using the [[comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]. Internal reconstruction is the method by which an element that contains a certain meaning is re-used in different contexts or environments where there is a variation in either sound or analogy.<ref name="Routledge introduction" />{{better source needed|date=December 2020}}

The reason for this had been to describe well-known [[Indo-European languages]], many of which used to have long written histories. Scholars of historical linguistics also studied [[Uralic languages]], another European language family for which very little written material existed back then. After this, there was significant work that followed on the corpora of other languages too, such as that of the [[Austronesian languages]] as well as of [[Native American language|Native American language families]].

The above approach of comparativism in linguistics is now, however, only a small part of the much broader discipline called historical linguistics. The comparative study of specific Indo-European languages is considered a highly specialised field today, while comparative research is carried out over the subsequent internal developments in a language. In particular, it is carried out over the development of modern standard varieties of languages, or over the development of a language from its standardised form to its varieties.

For instance, some scholars also undertook a study attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other language families to [[Nostratic]]. While these attempts are still not widely accepted as credible methods, they provide necessary information to establish relatedness in language change, something that is not easily available as the depth of time increases. The time-depth of linguistic methods is generally limited, due to the occurrence of chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed for the functional purpose of conducting research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldi|first=Philip|author-link=Philip Baldi|year=2012|title=Historical Linguistics and Cognitive Science|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Baldi_Dussias_Rhesis_2012_GD_09_13_2012.pdf|journal=Rheis, International Journal of Linguistics, Philology and Literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–27}} p.&nbsp;11.</ref> Difficulty also exists in the dating of various proto languages. Even though several methods are available, only approximate results can be obtained in terms of arriving at dates for these languages.

Today, with a subsequent re-development of grammatical studies, historical linguistics studies the change in language on a relational basis between dialect to dialect [[synchronic_linguistics|during one period]], as well as [[diachronic_linguistics|between those in the past and the present period]], and looks at evolution and shifts taking place morphologically, syntactically, as well as phonetically.

=== Syntax and morphology===
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2021}}
{{main|Syntax|Morphology (linguistics)}}
Syntax and morphology are branches of linguistics concerned with the order and structure of meaningful linguistic units such as words and [[morphemes]]. Syntacticians study the rules and constraints that govern how speakers of a language can organize words into sentences. Morphologists study similar rules for the order of morphemes—sub-word units such as prefixes and suffixes—and how they may be combined to form words.

While words, along with [[clitic]]s, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of [[syntax]], in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the [[grammar]] for that language. For example, [[English language|English]] speakers recognize that the words ''dog'' and ''dogs'' are closely related, differentiated only by the [[plural]]ity [[morpheme]] "-s", only found [[Bound morpheme|bound]] to [[noun phrase]]s. Speakers of English, a [[fusional language]], recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of [[word formation]]. They infer intuitively that ''dog'' is to ''dogs'' as ''cat'' is to ''cats''; and, in similar fashion, ''dog'' is to ''dog catcher'' as ''dish'' is to ''dishwasher''. By contrast, [[Classical Chinese]] has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes ("free" morphemes) and depending on [[word order]] to convey meaning. (Most words in modern [[Standard Chinese]] ["Mandarin"], however, are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and most [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.

[[Phonological]] and [[orthography|orthographic]] modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to [[literacy]] skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson-Fowler, E.B.|first=& Apel, K.|year=2015|title=Influence of Morphological Awareness on College Students' Literacy Skills: A path Analytic Approach|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|volume=47 |issue=3|pages=405–32|doi=10.1177/1086296x15619730|s2cid=142149285}}</ref>

[[Polysynthetic language]]s, such as [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word "təmeyŋəlevtpəγtərkən", for example, meaning "I have a fierce headache", is composed of eight morphemes ''t-ə-meyŋ-ə-levt-pəγt-ə-rkən'' that may be [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]]. The morphology of such languages allows for each [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] to be understood as [[morphemes]], while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme.

The discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is [[morphophonology]].

=== Semantics and pragmatics ===
{{main|Formal semantics (linguistics)|Cognitive semantics|Pragmatics}}
Semantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning. These subfields have traditionally been divided according to aspects of meaning thought to arise from the grammar versus linguistic and social context. Semantics in this conception is concerned with grammatical and lexical meanings and pragmatics concerned with meaning in context. The framework of [[formal semantics (natural language)|formal semantics]] studies the [[denotation]]s of sentences and the way they are [[compositionality|composed]] from the meanings of their constituent expressions. Formal semantics draws heavily on [[philosophy of language]] and uses formal tools from [[logic]] and [[computer science]]. [[Cognitive semantics]] ties linguistic meaning to general aspects of cognition, drawing on ideas from [[cognitive science]] such as [[prototype theory]]. 

Pragmatics encompasses phenomena such as [[speech act]]s, [[implicature]], and [[Conversation analysis|talk in interaction]].<ref name=Mey>Mey, Jacob L. (1993) ''Pragmatics: An Introduction''. Oxford: Blackwell (2nd ed. 2001).</ref> Unlike [[semantics]], which examines meaning that is conventional or "coded" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge ([[grammar]], [[lexicon]], etc.) of the speaker and listener but also on the context of the utterance,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/meaning-semantics-and-pragmatics|title=Meaning (Semantics and Pragmatics) {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=25 August 2017}}</ref> any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred [[intention|intent]] of the speaker, and other factors.<ref>{{cite web

=== Phonetics and phonology ===
{{main|Phonetics|Phonology}}
Phonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned with sounds (or the equivalent aspects of sign languages). Phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sounds such as their [[Articulatory phonetics|articulation]], acoustics, production, and perception. Phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds.

=== Typology ===
{{excerpt|Linguistic typology|only=paragraph}}

== Language varieties ==
{{see|Variety (linguistics)}}
Languages exist on a wide continuum of conventionalization with blurry divisions between concepts such as dialects and languages. Languages can undergo internal changes which lead to the development of subvarieties such as [[linguistic register]]s, accents, and dialects. Similarly, languages can undergo changes caused by contact with speakers of other languages, and new language varieties may be born from these contact situations through the process of [[language genesis]].

=== Contact varieties ===
{{see|Creolistics}}
Contact varieties such as pidgins and creoles are language varieties that often arise in situations of sustained contact between communities that speak different languages. [[Pidgin]]s are language varieties with limited conventionalization where ideas are conveyed through simplified grammars that may grow more complex as linguistic contact continues. [[Creole language]]s are language varieties similar to pidgins but with greater conventionalization and stability. As children grow up in contact situations, they may learn a local pidgin as their native language. Through this process of acquisition and transmission, new grammatical features and lexical items are created and introduced to fill [[lexical gap|gaps]] in the pidgin eventually developing into a complete language.

Not all language contact situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole, and researchers have studied the features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop. Often these varieties arise in situations of [[colonization]] and [[slavery|enslavement]], where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from learning the other's language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained. The subjugated language in the power relationship is the [[substrate language]], while the dominant language serves as the [[superstrate]]. Often the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate, making it the [[lexifier]], while grammatical structures come from the substrate, but this is not always the case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Selbach|first=Rachel|year=2008|chapter=The superstrate is not always the lexifier: Lingua Franca in the Barbary Coast 1530—1830|title=Roots of creole structures: Weighing the contribution of substrates and superstrates|volume=33|series=Creole Language Library|editor-last=Michaelis|editor-first=Susanne}}</ref>

=== Dialect ===
A dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language's speakers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://public.oed.com/help/|title=Help|website=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref> The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Other times, dialects remain marginalized, particularly when they are associated with marginalized social groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English with an accent: Language, ideology and discrimination in the United States|last=Lippi-Green|first=Rosina|publisher=Routledge|year=2012}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}} Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].

{{quote|"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&nbsp;– they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes."<ref>Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.</ref>}}

=== Standard language ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}
When a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a [[standard variety]], one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of [[speech community]] participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.

=== Relativity ===
As constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings, especially about [[deconstructivism|deconstruction]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacques Derrida|url=https://archive.org/details/writingdifferenc00derr_0|title=Writing and Difference|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-226-14329-3|translator=Alan Bass|url-access=registration}}</ref> have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, for which he was heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}</ref>

== Structures ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}
Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning "cat" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the [[knowledge engineering]] field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.

Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word "tenth" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word "tenth" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker "th" follows the number "ten."  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the "n" sound in "tenth" is made differently from the "n" sound in "ten" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of "tenth", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.

=== Grammar ===
[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound<ref>All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.</ref> as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).<ref>{{cite book |title=Linguistics |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51370-8 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121214215844/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2012 |edition=6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A. Demers |author3=Ann K. Farmer |author4=Robert M. Harnish |access-date=25 July 2012 }}</ref> Modern [[Grammar#Theoretical frameworks|frameworks that deal with the principles of grammar]] include [[structural linguistics|structural]] and [[functional linguistics]], and [[generative linguistics]].<ref>''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'' (Second Edition), 2013. Andrew Carnie. Blackwell Publishing.</ref>

Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following:
* '''[[Phonetics]]''', the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception, and delves into their acoustic and [[Articulatory phonetics|articulatory]] properties
* '''[[Phonology]]''', the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning ([[phonemes]])
* '''[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]''', the study of [[morphemes]], or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* '''[[Syntax]]''', the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]
* '''[[Semantics]]''', the study of lexical and grammatical aspects of meaning<ref>{{cite book|title= Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to Semantics |year=2000 |author1=Chierchia, Gennaro |author2=Sally McConnell-Ginet |name-list-style=amp|publisher= MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= 978-0-262-53164-1}}</ref>
* '''[[Pragmatics]]''', the study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]], and the role played by situational context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning<ref>{{cite book|title= Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to Semantics |year=2000 |author1=Chierchia, Gennaro |author2=Sally McConnell-Ginet |name-list-style=amp|publisher= MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= 978-0-262-53164-1}}</ref>
* '''[[Discourse analysis]]''', the analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* '''[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]]''', the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
* '''[[Semiotics]]''', the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication

=== Discourse ===
Discourse is language as social practice (Baynham, 1995) and is a multilayered concept.  As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Mira|year=2009|title=Discourse, grammar, discourse|jstor=24049745|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5–36|doi=10.1177/1461445608098496|s2cid=62686879}}</ref>  A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]].<ref>Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p.&nbsp;6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}</ref> There may be certain [[lexicon|lexical]] additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the "medical discourse", and so on.

=== Lexicon ===
The [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,<ref>{{Cite book |author-link=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4039-1723-2 |pages=2ff}}</ref> and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.

It is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.

=== Style ===
[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title="Stylistics" by Joybrato Mukherjee. Chapter 49. ''Encyclopedia of Linguistics''. |access-date=4 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220434/http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> It involves the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] used by speech communities. Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}</ref> diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.

In the 1960s, [[Jacques Derrida]], for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself.<ref>[[Writing and Difference]] by Jacques Derrida, 1967, and [[Of Grammatology]]</ref> [[Palaeography]] is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language.<ref>Chapter 1, section 1.1 in {{cite book|title=Trends in Linguistics: Runes and Germanic Linguistics|year=2002|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|isbn =978-3-11-017462-5|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gvSi3JVNRFQC |edition= 6th |author=Elmer H. Antonsen}}</ref> The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like [[psycholinguistics]], which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; [[neurolinguistics]], which studies language processing in the brain; [[biolinguistics]], which studies the biology and evolution of language; and [[language acquisition]], which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.

== Approaches ==
{{See also|Theory of language}}

=== Humanistic ===
The fundamental principle of humanistic linguistics is that language is an invention created by people. A [[Semiotics|semiotic]] tradition of linguistic research considers language a [[sign system]] which arises from the interaction of meaning and form.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nöth|first=Winfried |title=Handbook of Semiotics |publisher=Indiana University Press |date=1990 | url= https://salahlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/handbook-of-semiotics.pdf |isbn= 978-0-253-20959-7 | author-link=Winfried_Nöth}}</ref> The organisation of linguistic levels is considered [[computational]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hjelmslev|first=Louis |title=Prolegomena to a Theory of Language |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |date=1969 |orig-year=First published 1943|isbn= 0-299-02470-9| author-link=Louis_Hjelmslev}}</ref> Linguistics is essentially seen as relating to [[Sociology|social]] and [[Cultural anthropology|cultural studies]] because different languages are shaped in [[social interaction]] by the [[speech community]].<ref>{{cite book |last=de Saussure|first=Ferdinand |title=Course in General Linguistics |place=New York|publisher=The Philosophical Library, Inc. |date=1959 |orig-year=First published 1916| url=https://monoskop.org/images/0/0b/Saussure_Ferdinand_de_Course_in_General_Linguistics_1959.pdf |isbn= 978-0-231-15727-8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808231716/https://monoskop.org/images/0/0b/Saussure_Ferdinand_de_Course_in_General_Linguistics_1959.pdf |archive-date=8 August 2019 | author-link=Ferdinand_de_Saussure}}</ref> Frameworks representing the [[humanistic]] view of language include [[structural linguistics]], among others.<ref name="humanistic">{{cite journal | last=Austin | first=Patrik | date=2021 | title=Theory of language: a taxonomy | journal=SN Social Sciences | volume=1 | issue=3 | doi=10.1007/s43545-021-00085-x | doi-access=free }}</ref>

Structural analysis means dissecting each linguistic level: phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and discourse, to the smallest units. These are collected into inventories (e.g. phoneme, morpheme, lexical classes, phrase types) to study their interconnectedness within a hierarchy of structures and layers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schäfer|first=Roland |title=Einführung in die grammatische Beschreibung des Deutschen (2nd ed.) |place=Berlin|publisher=Language Science Press |date=2016 | url= https://www.oapen.org/download?type=document&docid=620310 |isbn= 978-1-537504-95-7 }}</ref> Functional analysis adds to structural analysis the assignment of semantic and other functional roles that each unit may have.

[[Functional linguistics]], or functional grammar, is a branch of structural linguistics. In the humanistic reference, the terms [[structuralism]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] are related to their meaning in other human sciences. The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have the properties they have. Functional [[explanation]] entails the idea that language is a tool for [[communication]], or that communication is the primary function of language. Linguistic forms are consequently explained by an appeal to their functional value, or usefulness. Other structuralist approaches take the perspective that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the bilateral and multilayered language system.<ref>{{cite book |last=Daneš |first=František |editor-last=Dirven |editor-first=R. | editor-last2=Fried |editor-first2=V. | title=Functionalism in Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins |date=1987 |pages=3–38 |chapter=On Prague school functionalism in linguistics |isbn= 978-90-272-1524-6}}</ref>

=== Biological ===
{{further|Biolinguistics|Biosemiotics}}
Approaches such as [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[generative grammar]] study linguistic [[cognition]] with a view towards uncovering the [[biology|biological]] underpinnings of language. In [[Generative Grammar]], these underpinning are understood as including [[Linguistic nativism|innate]] [[domain-specific]] grammatical knowledge. Thus, one of the central concerns of the approach is to discover what aspects of linguistic knowledge are innate and which are not.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Everaert|first1= Martin|last2=Huybregts |first2=Marinus A.

== Methodology ==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2021}}
Linguistics is primarily [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]].<ref name="Martinet">{{cite book|title=Elements of General Linguistics |last=Martinet |first=André |author-link=André Martinet |translator=Elisabeth Palmer Rubbert |series=Studies in General Linguistics, vol. i. |location=London |publisher=Faber |year=1960 |page=15}}</ref> Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is "good" or "bad". This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is "better" or "worse" than another.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or "[[acrolect]]". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in [[language education|language instruction]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.

=== Sources ===
Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because
* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;
* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;
* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;
* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;
* Individuals learn to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they do with [[writing]].

Nonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.

The study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.

=== Analysis ===
Before the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with the rise of [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.

At another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article "the" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.

=== Early grammarians ===
{{further|Philology|Grammarian (Greco-Roman)}}
The formal study of language began in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 6th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Pāṇini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a Persian, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fii an-naħw'' ({{lang|ar|الكتاب في النحو}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,<ref>{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.</ref> but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word "[[grammar]]" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as "[[Art of Grammar|téchnē grammatikḗ]]" ({{script|Grek|Τέχνη Γραμματική}}), the "art of writing", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A. M.  |year=1998|title=Western linguistics: An historical introduction|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20891-4|pages=2–24}}</ref> Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient languages and texts, practised by such educators as [[Roger Ascham]], [[Wolfgang Ratke]], and [[John Amos Comenius]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=308}}.</ref>

===Comparative philology===
In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=310}}.</ref> Bloomfield attributes "the first great scientific linguistic work of the world" to [[Jacob Grimm]], who wrote ''Deutsche Grammatik''.<ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311">{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=311}}.</ref> It was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe. The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:<ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"/>

{{quote|This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''{{lang|de|Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts}}'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').}}

=== 20th-century developments ===
There was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early 20th century. Structural analysis was improved by Leonard Bloomfield, [[Louis Hjelmslev]]; and [[Zellig Harris]] who also developed methods of [[discourse analysis]]. Functional analysis was developed by the [[Prague linguistic circle]] and [[André Martinet]]. As sound recording devices became commonplace in the 1960s, dialectal recordings were made and archived, and the [[audio-lingual method]] provided a technological solution to foreign language learning. The 1960s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics: the study of [[language universals]] in [[linguistic typology]]. Towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of [[language technology]] and digitalised [[corpus linguistics|corpora]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

== Areas of research ==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2021}}

=== Sociolinguistics ===
{{main|Sociolinguistics}}
Sociolinguistics is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language, as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.

=== Developmental linguistics ===
{{main|Developmental linguistics}}
Developmental linguistics is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.

=== Neurolinguistics ===
{{main|Neurolinguistics}}
Neurolinguistics is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mariën|first1=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=25 October 2017|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101–03|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Applied linguistics ===
{{Main|Applied linguistics}}
Linguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and "applies" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. "Applied linguistics" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-437444-6}}</ref> Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally "applying" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)

Today, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide [[voice interface]]s to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.

Linguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.<ref name="Linguistic Analysis">{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503–26 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf }}</ref> This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.<ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/> Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.<ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/> Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.<ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/>

=== Language documentation ===
[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] – the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.

Since the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of [[formal linguistics]] in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.

The emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a focus in some university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.<ref>Himmelman, Nikolaus "Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann & Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin & New York.</ref>

=== Translation ===
The sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]], which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology, science, law, economics, etc.

=== Clinical linguistics ===
{{main|Clinical linguistics}}
Clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the field of [[speech-language pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to treat [[communication disorders|communication]] and swallowing disorders.

Chaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders like rhyming inappropriately have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient was shown a color chip and then asked to identify it, responded "looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day." The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'

However, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.<ref>Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.</ref>

=== Computational linguistics ===
{{main|Computational linguistics}}
Computational linguistics is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is "computationally responsible", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.

=== Evolutionary linguistics ===
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
Evolutionary linguistics is the study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–34  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 }}</ref> Evolutionary linguistics is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces the natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of language are understood.

=== Forensic linguistics ===
{{main|Forensic linguistics}}
Forensic linguistics is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also used their expertise in the framework of criminal cases.
