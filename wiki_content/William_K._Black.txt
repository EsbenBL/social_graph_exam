'''William Kurt Black''' (born September 6, 1951) is an American lawyer, academic, author, and a former bank regulator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/profiles/Black/black_cv.pdf|title=University of Missouri - Kansas City<!--INSERT TITLE-->|access-date=2009-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419161318/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/profiles/Black/black_cv.pdf|archive-date=2009-04-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> Black's expertise is in [[white-collar crime]], [[public finance]], regulation, and other topics in law and economics.

== Savings and loan scandal ==
Black was a central figure in exposing Congressional corruption during the [[Savings and Loan Crisis]]. He took the notes during the [[Keating Five]] meeting that were later published in the press, and brought the event to national attention and a congressional investigation.

According to [[Bill Moyers]],

<blockquote>The former Director of the Institute for Fraud Prevention now teaches Economics and Law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. During the savings and loan crisis, it was Black who accused then-house speaker [[Jim Wright]] and five US Senators, including [[John Glenn]] and [[John McCain]], of doing favors for the S&L's in exchange for contributions and other perks. The senators got off with a slap on the wrist, but so enraged was one of those bankers, [[Charles Keating]] — after whom the senate's so-called "Keating Five" were named — he sent a memo that read, in part, 'get Black — kill him dead.' Metaphorically, of course. Of course.<ref name="Movers20090403">{{cite web |title=Transcript, April 3, 2009: William K.

== [[Late-2000s financial crisis|Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] ==
<blockquote>

==''Bill Moyers Journal'' appearances ==
On April 3, 2009 Black appeared on ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and provided critical commentary on the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|U.S. banking crisis]]. Black asserted that the banking crisis in the US that started in late 2008 is essentially a big [[Ponzi scheme]]; that the "[[Stated income loan|liar loans]]" and other financial tricks were essentially illegal frauds; and that the triple-A ratings given to these loans was part of a criminal cover-up. He said that the "[[Prompt Corrective Action Law]]" passed after the [[Savings and loan crisis]] mandated that ailing banks should be put into [[receivership]]. Black also stated that trying to hide how bad the situation is will simply prolong the problem, as happened in Japan and resulted in Japan's [[Lost Decade (Japan)|lost decade]]. Black stated that [[Timothy Geithner]] was engaged in a cover-up, and that the administration did not want people to understand what went wrong or how bad the banking situation was.<ref name="Movers20090403" /> On April 23, 2010, Black was again interviewed by Moyers to update the public's understanding  of the financial crisis.<ref name="Moyers20100423">{{cite web |title=Transcript, April 23, 2010: William K. Black |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04232010/watch.html |website=Bill Moyers Journal |publisher=PBS |access-date=11 May 2021}}</ref>

== Testimony before Congress on the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers ==
On April 20, 2010, Black testified before the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]] in a hearing titled "Public Policy Issues Raised by the Report of the Lehman Bankruptcy Examiner." He testified about the role that [[Alt-A]] mortgages, what he called "liars' loans," on residential real estate played in the downfall of [[Lehman Brothers]]. His testimony was that "Lehman's failure is a story in large part of fraud. And it is fraud that begins at the absolute latest in 2001, and that is with their subprime and liars' loan operations."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://firedoglake.com/2010/04/20/bill-black-testimony-on-lehman-bankruptcy-transcript-and-video/ |title=Transcript & Video: Bill Black Testimony on Lehman Bankruptcy |first=Jane |last=Hamsher |authorlink=Jane Hamsher |date=April 20, 2010 |work=FireDogLake|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> As explained in his prepared statement, his reference was to Aurora Loan Services, Inc., which was a subsidiary of Lehman: "Lehman's principal source of (fictional) income and real losses was making (and selling) what the trade accurately called 'liar's loans' through its subsidiary, Aurora. (The bland euphemism for liar's loans was '[[Alt-A]].') Liar's loans are 'criminogenic' (they create epidemics of mortgage fraud) because they create strong incentives to provide false information on loan applications."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.financialservices.house.gov/media/file/hearings/111/black_4.20.10.pdf|title=Prepared Testimony of William K. Black|date=April 20, 2010|work=Committee Hearing: Public Policy Issues Raised by the Report of the Lehman Bankruptcy Examiner|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]]|page=5|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref>

On the same page in his [[prepared testimony]] Black referenced an article from the ''[[The Denver Post|Denver Post]]'' dated September 16, 2008, the day after Lehman filed for bankruptcy. The article reported on the uncertain fate of Aurora Loan Services, which was based nearby, and quoted Lehman's chief financial officer as saying the previous week that, "The majority of our write-downs were in Alt-A driven by an increase in.. . delinquencies and loss expectations." The article also said that Lehman was "among the first of its peers to originate home loans and securitize them for sale across the globe, and it fueled the growth of the Alt-A loan."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_10473057|title=Local Lehman arm led in Alt-A loans|first=Greg|last=Griffin|date=September 16, 2008|work=[[Denver Post]]|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref>

== Testimony before Irish Banking Inquiry ==
Black was invited to testify before the Irish parliament's banking inquiry in February 2015. In his testimony, he described the broad September 2008 [[Post-2008 Irish banking crisis#State responses|Irish bank guarantee]], as "the most destructive own goal in history".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/banking-inquiry-bill-black-2-1921195-Feb2015/|title=The bank guarantee 'was the most destructive own goal in history that sunk an entire nation'|first=Hugh|last=O'Connell|date=February 5, 2015|work=[[TheJournal.ie]]|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>
