'''Lucien Goldmann''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡɔldman|lang}}; 20 July 1913 – 8 October 1970) was a French philosopher and sociologist of Jewish-Romanian origin. A professor at the [[EHESS]] in Paris, he was a [[Marxist]] theorist. His wife was sociologist [[Annie Goldmann]].

==Biography==
Goldmann was born in [[Bucharest]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], but grew up in [[Botoşani]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} He studied law at the [[University of Bucharest]] and the [[University of Vienna]] under the [[Austromarxist]] jurist [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]].<ref name="Jay">[[Martin Jay]], ''Marxism and Totality: The Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas'', University of California Press, 1984, pp. 305–06.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> In 1934, he went to the [[University of Paris]] to study political economy, literature, and philosophy. He moved to [[Switzerland]] in November 1942, where he was placed in a refugee camp until 1943.<ref name="Jay"/>

Through [[Jean Piaget]]'s intervention, he was subsequently given a scholarship to the [[University of Zurich]],<ref name="Jay"/> where he completed his PhD in philosophy in 1945 with a thesis entitled ''Mensch, Gemeinschaft und Welt in der Philosophie Immanuel Kants'' (''Man, Community and world in the Philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]]'').{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Philosophy<!--'Genetic structuralism' redirects here-->==
While many Parisian leftists staunchly upheld Marxism's "[[scientificity]]" in the 1950s and 1960s, Lucien Goldmann insisted that Marxism was by then in severe crisis and had to reinvent itself radically if it were to survive. He rejected the traditional Marxist view of the [[proletariat]] and contested the [[Structural Marxism|structural Marxist]] movement. In fact, the popularity of such trends on the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]] was one reason why Goldmann's own name and work were eclipsed — this despite the acclaim of thinkers as diverse as [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], who called him "the finest and most intelligent Marxist of the age."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

He refused to portray his aspirations for humanity's future as an inexorable unfolding of history's laws, but saw them rather as a [[Pascal's Wager|wager]] akin to [[Blaise Pascal]]'s in the [[existence of God]]. "Risk", Goldmann wrote in his classic study of Pascal's ''[[Pensées]]'' and [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]], "is possibility of failure, hope of success, and the synthesis of the three in a faith which is a wager are the essential constituent elements of the human condition". He called his work "dialectical" and "humanist". He sought to synthesize the [[genetic epistemology]] of Piaget with the Marxism of [[György Lukács]].<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF01880859 "Genetic structuralism and the analysis of social consciousness"]; accessed 3 July 2020.</ref>

Goldmann founded the theory of '''genetic structuralism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> in the 1960s. He was a humanist socialist, a disciple of Lukács, and was best known for his sociology of literature. In later life he became an important critic of [[structuralism]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-GoldmannLucien.html Lucien Goldmann, a Dictionary of Sociology], Encyclopedia.com; accessed 3 July 2020.</ref>
