==Early years and personal life==
Gilder was born in New York City and raised in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/05/29/the-gilder-effect-2|title=The Gilder Effect|work=The New Yorker|access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref> He is a great-grandson of designer [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AStXAAAAYAAJ&q=%22George+Franklin+Gilder%22|title=Nexus: The Bimonthly Newsletter of the New England Historic Genealogical Society|date=April 24, 1984|publisher=The Society|access-date=April 24, 2020|via=Google Books}}</ref> His father, Richard Watson Gilder, was killed flying in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in World War II when Gilder was two years old.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

He spent most of his childhood with his mother, Anne Spring (Alsop), and his stepfather, Gilder Palmer, on a dairy farm in [[Tyringham, Massachusetts]]. Gilder, a college roommate of his father, was deeply involved with his upbringing.<ref name="MacFarquhar">{{Citation

Gilder currently lives in Tyringham with his wife, Nini, with whom he had four children.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

==Education==
Gilder attended Hamilton School in New York City, [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], and [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1962.<ref name="MacFarquhar" /> He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the [[Harvard Institute of Politics]], and edited the ''Ripon Forum'', the newspaper of the liberal Republican [[Ripon Society]].

== Marine Corps==
Gilder served in the [[United States Marine Corps]].<ref>Gilder anecdotally writes about his time in the Marine Corps in [https://www.forbes.com/2006/12/14/fisher-gilder-telecosm-pf-guru-in_gg_1214soapbox_inl.html this Forbes article].</ref>

==Career==
===Speechwriting===
In the 1960s Gilder served as a speechwriter for several prominent officials and candidates, including [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[George W. Romney]], and [[Richard Nixon]]. He worked as a spokesman for the [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Charles Mathias, Jr.|Charles Mathias]], as [[Anti-war movement|antiwar]] protesters surrounded the capital; some eventually scared Gilder out of his apartment. Gilder moved to [[Harvard Square]] the following year, and he became a writer who modeled himself after [[Joan Didion]].

With his college roommate, [[Bruce Chapman]], he wrote an attack on the [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] policies of the 1964 Republican presidential candidate [[Barry Goldwater]], ''The Party That Lost Its Head'' (1966). He later recanted this attack: "The far Right&nbsp;— the same men I dismissed as extremists in my youth&nbsp;— turned out to know far more than I did. At least the 'right-wing extremists', as I confidently called them, were right on almost every major policy issue from welfare to Vietnam to Keynesian economics and defense&nbsp;— while I, in my Neo-Conservative sophistication, was nearly always wrong."<ref>{{Citation | last=Gilder|first=George|title=Why I am Not a Neo-Conservative|journal=National Review|date=March 5, 1982|volume=34|issue=4|pages=219–20}}</ref>

===Supply-side economics===
[[Supply-side economics]] was formulated in the mid-1970s by [[Jude Wanniski]] and [[Robert L. Bartley]] at ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a counterweight to the reigning "demand-side" [[Keynesian economics]]. At the center of the concept was the [[Laffer curve]], the idea that high tax rates reduce government revenue. Its opponents often refer to it as "[[trickle-down economics]]". Inspired by Wanniski and by the works of [[free market|free-market]] economists like [[Murray Rothbard]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] and writer [[Ayn Rand]].<ref>[[Jonathan Chait|Chait, Jonathan]] (September 14, 2009) [http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/wealthcare-0 Wealthcare], ''[[The New Republic]]''</ref> 

Gilder wrote a book extending the ideas of his ''Visible Man'' (1978) into the realm of economics, to balance his theory of poverty with a theory of wealth.<ref>{{Citation

| year = 1993}}</ref> The book, published as the best-selling ''Wealth and Poverty'' in 1981, communicated the ideas of supply-side economics to a wide audience in the United States and the world.{{sfn|Gilder|1993|p=xv}}{{Non-primary source needed|date=November 2021}}

Gilder also contributed to the development of supply-side economics when he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute's Economic Roundtable, as Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor to Laffer's economic reports and the editorial page of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovery.org/p/gilder/|title=George Gilder|first=George|last=Gilder|website=Discovery Institute|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>

===Technology===
In the 1990s, he became an enthusiastic evangelist of technology and the Internet. He uncovered emerging trends in several books and his newsletter, the Gilder Technology Report.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/05/29/the-gilder-effect-2|title=The Gilder Effect|work=The New Yorker}}</ref>

The first mention of the word "[[Digerati]]" on [[USENET]] occurred in 1992 and referred to an article by Gilder in ''[[Upside (magazine)|Upside]]'' magazine. His other books include ''Life After Television'', a 1990 book that predicted microchip "telecomputers" connected by fiberoptic cable would make broadcast-model television obsolete. The book was also notable for being published by the [[FedEx|Federal Express]] company and featuring full-page advertisements for that company on every fifth page.<ref>David Foster Wallace, "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction", ''Review of Contemporary Fiction'', 185</ref>

Gilder wrote the books ''Microcosm'', about [[Carver Mead]] and the [[CMOS]] [[microchip revolution]]; ''Telecosm'', about the promise of [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]]; and his latest, ''The Silicon Eye'', about the [[Foveon X3 sensor]], a digital camera imager chip. The book cover of the Silicon Eye reads, "How a Silicon Valley Company Aims to Make All Current Computers, Cameras, and Cell Phones Obsolete." The Foveon sensor has not achieved this goal and has not yet been used in cell phones.

Gilder is an active investor in private companies and serves as the chairman of the advisory board in Israel-based [[ASOCS]] that he discovered during his research for ''Israel Test''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telecoms.com/intelligence/technology-visionary-george-gilder-invests-in-asocs/|title=Technology Visionary George Gilder Invests in ASOCS|first=Sophie|last=Egan|date=February 9, 2011|website=Telecoms.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>

===On women and feminism===
In the early 1970s, Gilder wrote an article in the ''Ripon Forum'' defending President [[Richard Nixon]]'s veto of a [[day-care]] bill sponsored by Senator [[Walter Mondale]] (D-Minnesota) and Senator [[Jacob Javits]] (R-New York). He was fired as editor as a result.<ref name="MacFarquhar" /> To defend himself, he appeared on ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]''.

Gilder moved to [[New Orleans]] and worked in the mornings for Ben Toledano, Republican candidate for the United States Senate in 1972 and the party's nominee for [[List of mayors of New Orleans|mayor of New Orleans]] in 1970. Also, he wrote ''Sexual Suicide'' (1973), revised and reissued as ''Men and Marriage'' (1986). The book achieved a ''[[succès de scandale]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' made Gilder "Male Chauvinist Pig of the Year."<ref name="MacFarquhar" />

===Support for immigration===
Gilder has praised [[mass immigration]] as an economic boon in both the [[Immigration to the United States|US]] and [[Aliyah|Israel]]. Although Gilder's support for mass immigration is framed by [[high tech]] hubs such as [[Silicon Valley]]'s need for computer programmers, he sees recent American immigration policy as being vital to American prosperity overall.{{Better source needed|date=September 2019}}<ref>{{Citation

===Speaking engagements and editorial contributions===
For nearly thirty years, he has lectured internationally on economics, technology, education, and social theory. He has addressed audiences from Washington, DC, to the Vatican, and he has appeared at numerous conferences, public policy events, and media outlets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/1996/03/gilder-5/|title=George Gilder|publisher=Wired|access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref>

==''Wealth and Poverty''==
After completing ''Visible Man'' in the late 1970s Gilder began writing "The Pursuit of Poverty." In early 1981 [[Basic Books]] published the result as ''[[Wealth and Poverty]]''. It was an analysis of the roots of economic growth. Reviewing it within a month of the inauguration of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer called it "A Guide to Capitalism". It offered, he wrote, "a creed for capitalism worthy of intelligent people."<ref>{{Citation

In ''Wealth and Poverty'', Gilder extended the sociological and anthropological analysis of his early books in which he had advocated for the socialization of men into service to women through work and marriage. He wove these sociological themes into the economic policy prescriptions of [[supply-side economics]]. In his eyes the breakup of the nuclear family and the policies of [[demand-side economics]] led to poverty, while family and supply-side policies led to wealth.

In reviewing the problems of the immediate past—the inflation, recession, and urban problems of the 1970s—and proposing his supply-side solutions, Gilder argued not just the practical but the moral superiority of supply-side capitalism over the alternatives. "Capitalism begins with giving," he asserted, while [[New Deal]] liberalism created moral hazard. It was work, family, and faith that created wealth out of poverty. "It is this supply-side moral vision that underlies all the economic arguments of ''Wealth and Poverty,''" he wrote.{{sfn|Gilder|1993|p=xxii}}{{Primary source inline|date=November 2021}}

In 1994 Gilder wrote that the poor in America are “ruined by the overflow of American prosperity” and “moral decay” and that they are in need of "Christian teaching from the churches."<ref name="acton">{{Citation| last = Gilder	| first = George| title = Freedom from Welfare Dependency| journal = Religion & Liberty| date = March–April 1994| url = http://www.acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-4-number-2/freedom-welfare-dependency}}</ref>

==Intelligent design==
He helped found the [[Discovery Institute]] with [[Bruce Chapman]]. The organization started as a moderate group that aimed to privatize and modernize Seattle's transit systems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It later became the leading thinktank of the [[intelligent design movement]], with Gilder writing many articles for intelligent design and against the [[theory of evolution]].<ref>[[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris C.
