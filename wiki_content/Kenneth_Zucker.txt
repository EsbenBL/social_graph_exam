'''Kenneth J. Zucker''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|n|ɪ|θ|_|'|dʒ|eɪ|_|ˈ|z|ʊ|k|ər}}; born 1950) is an American-Canadian [[psychologist]] and [[sexologist]]. He was named editor-in-chief of ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' in 2001. He was psychologist-in-chief at Toronto's [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (CAMH)<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Kenneth Zucker| url=http://www.camh.ca/en/research/about_research_at_CAMH/scientific_staff_profile/Pages/Kenneth-Zucker.aspx| publisher=Centre for Addiction and Mental Health|access-date=22 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417032252/http://www.camh.ca/en/research/about_research_at_CAMH/scientific_staff_profile/Pages/Kenneth-Zucker.aspx|archive-date=April 17, 2015}}</ref> and head of its Gender Identity Service until its closure in December 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=CAMH to 'wind down' controversial gender identity clinic services |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/camh-to-wind-down-controversial-gender-identity-clinic-services/article27766580/ |website=The Globe and Mail|access-date=15 December 2015}}</ref> Zucker is a professor in the departments of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Toronto]].

==Life==
Zucker was born in 1950 to Jewish parents and grew up in [[Skokie, Illinois]].<ref name="prospect">{{cite news | last = Schwartzapfel | first = Beth | date = March 14, 2013 | title = Born This Way? | work = The American Prospect | access-date = March 23, 2015 | url = http://prospect.org/article/born-way}}</ref> Zucker received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Southern Illinois University]], his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Roosevelt University]], and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[University of Toronto]] in 1982. He holds a certification from [[College of Psychologists of Ontario]].

Zucker became interested in gender identity after reading [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]]'s 1974 book ''Sexual Identity Conflict in Children and Adults''.<ref name="prospect" /> Zucker's graduate work in [[developmental psychology]] resulted in his master's thesis on [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[gender identity]] development in children. While in graduate school, Zucker met his future collaborator, [[Susan Bradley]], a [[child and adolescent psychiatry|child psychiatrist]] on staff at the Child and Adolescent Service of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry (now the Child and Family Studies Centre of the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]]), a public mental health centre and teaching hospital of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine]].

Zucker was impressed with the Clarke Institute and met with then chief of psychology, Kingsley Ferguson, who told Zucker of Bradley's new working group assessing children and adolescents with [[gender identity]] problems. He joined Bradley's group.<ref name="zucker1995">{{cite book |last1=Zucker |first1=Kenneth J. |first2=Susan J. |last2=Bradley |author-link2=Susan Bradley | year = 1995 | title = Gender Identity Disorder and Psychosexual Problems in Children and Adolescents |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

==Therapeutic intervention for gender variance==
Since the mid-1970s, Zucker has treated about 500 preadolescent gender-variant children to have them accept the gender identity they were assigned at birth until they are at an age he believes they may determine their own gender identity.<ref name="brown2006">{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Patricia Leigh | date = December 2, 2006 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/02/us/02child.html | title = Supporting Boys or Girls When the Line Isn't Clear | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Zucker says he tries to encourage children to accept their birth sex and supports them in transitioning should they still experience gender dysphoria into adolescence.<ref>{{cite news |last= Rizza|first= Alanna|date= 9 October 2018|title= Former CAMH psychologist defends his work at youth gender identity clinic|url= https://toronto.citynews.ca/2018/10/09/former-camh-psychologist-defends-his-work-at-youth-gender-identity-clinic/ |work= CityNews}}</ref>

For children assigned as male at birth, Zucker reportedly asked parents to take away toys<ref name="TVO interview">{{cite news | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txd4YcjI5ys | title = Diagnostic Criteria of Gender Identity Disorder | publisher = [[TVOntario]]}}</ref> associated with girls and to instruct their child not to play alongside or draw pictures of girls,<ref name="spiegel2008">{{cite news | last = Spiegel | first = Alix | date = May 7, 2008 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90247842 | title = Two families grapple with sons' gender preferences | work = [[All Things Considered]] | publisher = [[National Public Radio]]}}</ref> although the parent that originally made this claim has more recently expressed that there was a miscommunication in the original interview and that such directives were to treat the social isolation that stemmed from her son's obsession with dolls.<ref name="howthefight" /> Psychologist Darryl Hill wrote that Zucker and Bradley believed that conversion treatments can reduce rejection by enabling gender non-conforming children to mix with children of the same sex, reducing the possibility of adult gender dysphoria.<ref name="hill2006">{{cite book |author1=Hill D.B. |author2=Rozanski C. |author3=Carfagnini J. |author4=Willoughby B. | year = 2006 | chapter = Gender Identity Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence: A Critical Inquiry | pages = 7–34 |veditors=Karasic D, Drescher J | title = Sexual and Gender Diagnoses of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM): A Reevaluation | publisher = Haworth Press | isbn = 978-0-7890-3214-0}}</ref>

Among Zucker's publications is the [[Medical history|case history]] of two patients who were male by birth but underwent a [[penectomy]] and were shortly thereafter reassigned as female. At age 26, both denied ever feeling the desire to be male. Both patients reported more masculine behavior and bisexuality, about which Zucker suspects that gender role and sexual orientation develop mostly before birth while gender identity development begins shortly after birth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=SJ |first=Bradley |author2=Oliver GD |author3=Chernick AB |author4=Zucker KJ  |title=Experiment of Nurture: Ablatio Penis at 2 Months, Sex Reassignment at 7 Months, and a Psychosexual Follow-up in Young Adulthood |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=e9 |year = 1998 |pmid=9651461 |doi=10.1542/peds.102.1.e9|doi-access=free }}</ref> There is some support for the position that "prenatal sex differentiation can at least sometimes trump social influences."<ref name="dingfelder2004">{{cite journal | url = http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr04/gender.html | access-date = June 17, 2008 | last= Dingfelder | first= Sadie F. | title = Gender bender | year = 2004 | journal = Monitor on Psychology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | page = 48}}</ref>

Zucker says parents set the goals at his clinic. "We recommend that one goal be to help the child feel more secure about his or her actual gender, another to deal with the child's emotional difficulties, and a third to help with problems in the family. It's helpful to have parents set limits on things like cross-dressing, which many parents have not done before coming to us."<ref name="goleman1994">{{cite news | last = Goleman | first = Daniel | date = March 22, 1994 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E0DA153CF931A15750C0A962958260 | title = The 'Wrong' Sex: A New Definition Of Childhood Pain | work = The New York Times}}</ref> Zucker's follow-up of 50 treated children found that "about 10 percent are still very unhappy about their gender, still cross-dressing, and thinking about having sex reassignment surgery" as young adults.<ref name="goleman1994" /> Zucker has stated that "the therapist must rely on the 'clinical wisdom' that has accumulated and to utilize largely untested case formulation conceptual models to inform treatment approaches and decisions."<ref name="neuropsychiatrie2008">{{cite journal | author = Zucker K.J. | year = 2008 | title = Children with gender identity disorder: Is there a best practice? | journal = Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 358–364 | doi=10.1016/j.neurenf.2008.06.003}}</ref>

Zucker coauthored a statistical report with [[J. Michael Bailey]] that found gay men and lesbians exhibited more cross-gender activity as children.<ref name="bailey1995">{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J.M. |author2=Zucker K.J. | year = 1995 | title = Childhood Sex-Typed Behavior and Sexual Orientation: A Conceptual Analysis and Quantitative Review | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–55 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.43}}</ref>

For [[adolescent]] clients expressing gender identity disorder, Zucker's treatment protocol resembles that for adult GID, consisting of [[hormone replacement therapy]] to aid the adolescent in a social transition. Zucker's clinic does not provide recommendations for [[sex reassignment surgery]] – instead, clients are encouraged to pursue reassignment through the adult Gender Identity Clinic at CAMH, which controls funding for the procedure in [[Ontario]].

Critics have compared Zucker's approaches with [[conversion therapy]]. The [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] believes "'reparative' therapy that seeks to reverse sexual orientation or gender identification"<ref name="dean2000">{{cite journal | last = Dean | first = Laura| year = 2000 | title = Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender health: Findings and concerns | journal = [[Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 102–151|display-authors=etal| doi = 10.1023/A:1009573800168 | s2cid = 13696265}}</ref> is an "extreme example" of bias that "may lead to increased self hatred and mental health problems."<ref name="ryan1999">{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = C. | last2 = Bradford | first2 = J. | last3 = Honnold | first3 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Social workers' and counselors' knowledge and understanding of lesbians | journal = Journal of Lesbian and Gay Social Services | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.1300/j041v09n04_01}}</ref>  Psychiatrist Simon Pickstone-Taylor has cited similarities between Zucker's therapeutic intervention and conversion therapy for homosexuals.<ref name="pickstone2003">{{cite journal | last = Pickstone-Taylor | first = Simon D. | year = 2003 | title = Children with gender nonconformity | journal = [[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 266; author reply 266–8 | url = http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2809%2960558-X/abstract | doi=10.1097/00004583-200303000-00005 | pmid = 12595778}}</ref> Zucker responded that prevention of homosexuality was never a goal in their treatments and cites a lack of empirical evidence for the most effective approach.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=Susan J.|last2=Zucker|first2=Kenneth J. |title=Children With Gender Nonconformity: Drs.

==Closure of the CAMH Gender Identity Clinic for Children==
In 2015, the Ontario provincial parliament introduced legislation banning conversion therapy.<ref name="metro" />  Members of Rainbow Health Ontario, a provincial health promotion and navigation organization, approached CAMH expressing their concerns regarding Zucker's clinic. They alleged that cases of suicide of transgender youth result from methods used by Zucker and that the ban on conversion therapy made those methods illegal.<ref name="howthefight">{{cite news |last= Singal| first= Jesse| date= 7 February 2016|title= How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got a Leading Sex Researcher Fired| url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html |work= New York Magazine}}</ref> CAMH stopped the clinic from accepting new patients and initiated an external review of the clinic's practices.

The reviewers were child and adolescent psychiatrists Suzanne Zinck of Halifax, and Antonio Pignatiello of Toronto.  They invited stakeholders to comment on their experiences in the clinic. A former client, now an adult, claimed Zucker "asked him to remove his shirt in front of other clinicians present, laughed when he complied, and then referred to him as a 'hairy little vermin'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyxtra.com/toronto/news-and-ideas/news/toronto-centre-shutters-youth-gender-clinic-181985|title=Toronto centre shutters youth gender clinic|first=Arshy|last=Mann|publisher=The Daily Xtra|date=2015-12-15|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref> The review noted numerous strengths of the clinic, but also described it as an insular entity with an approach dissimilar from other clinics and described it as being out of step with current best practices, including WPATH SOC version 7. They also raised concerns about clinicians asking age inappropriate questions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/GIC-Review-26Nov2015-TA1.pdf|title=External review of the Gender Identity Clinic of the child, youth and family services in the underserved populations program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health|publisher=CAMH|date=2015-11-26|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref>

After the review, CAMH shut down the clinic and fired Zucker. [[Kwame McKenzie]], medical director of CAMH's child, youth, and family services, said "We want to apologize for the fact that not all of the practices in our childhood gender identity clinic are in step with the latest thinking"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ubelacker|first1=Sheryl|title=CAMH to 'wind down' controversial gender identity clinic services|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/camh-to-wind-down-controversial-gender-identity-clinic-services/article27766580/|access-date=15 December 2015|agency=Canadian Press|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=December 15, 2015}}</ref> and that Zucker is "no longer at CAMH." CAMH announced a process of consultation with community leaders to examine how best to offer care.<ref>{{cite news|title=CAMH to 'wind down' gender identity clinic after review of services|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/camh-gender-identity-1.3366424?cmp=rss|access-date=December 15, 2015|agency=Canadian Press|publisher=CBC News|date=December 15, 2015}}</ref>

CAMH director Kwame McKenzie said that Zucker's treatments were against the centre's guidelines. Prior to the review, he stated that there exists two groups of thinking on such therapy for children under 11 among professionals.<ref name="metro">{{cite news

==''Archives of Sexual Behavior''==
As editor of ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', Zucker published a controversial study on [[conversion therapy]] by [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]]. According to ''The New York Times'', after his presentation of the study caused controversy, Spitzer asked Zucker to publish it. "I knew Bob and the quality of his work, and I agreed to publish it," Zucker said in an interview. "But I told him I would do it only if I also published commentaries".
