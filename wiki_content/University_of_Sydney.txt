The '''University of Sydney''' ('''USyd''', '''usyd,''' '''USYD''', or informally '''Sydney Uni''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. Founded in 1850, it is Australia's first university and is regarded as one of the world's leading universities. The university is one of Australia's six [[sandstone universities]]. The university comprises eight academic faculties and university schools, through which it offers bachelor, master and doctoral degrees.

The [[QS World University Rankings]] ranked the university as one of the world's top 25 universities for academic reputation,<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020 |title = QS World University Rankings 2020 - Rankings Indicators, Academic Reputation |website=Top Universities |access-date=2018-06-08 }}</ref> and top 4 in the world and first in Australia for graduate employability.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/employability-rankings/2020 |title = Graduate Employability Rankings 2020 |website=Top Universities |access-date=2017-10-14 }}</ref> It is one of the first universities in the world to admit students solely on academic merit, and opened their doors to women on the same basis as men.<ref>{{cite web |title=World University Rankings - The University of Sydney |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-sydney |website=Times Higher Education |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>

==History==
===1850–1950===
[[File:Parramattard1870susyd.jpg|thumb|The University of Sydney as viewed from [[Parramatta Road]] in the early 1870s]]

In 1848, [[William Wentworth]], a [[University of Cambridge]] graduate, and Sir [[Charles Nicholson]], a graduate of medicine from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], proposed a plan to expand the existing Sydney College into a larger university in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. Wentworth argued that a state secular university was imperative for the growth of a society aspiring towards self-government, and that it would provide the opportunity for "the child of every class, to become great and useful in the destinies of his country".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-79.html|title=Documenting Democracy|work=foundingdocs.gov.au}}; J.

The university was established via the passage of the ''University of Sydney Act 1850'' (NSW),<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=79 |title=Documenting Democracy |website = Foundingdocs.gov.au |access-date=22 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091017060853/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=79 |archive-date=17 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> on 24 September 1850 and was assented on 1 October 1850 by governor Sir [[Charles Augustus FitzRoy|Charles Fitzroy]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51788553 |title=William Charles Wentworth. |newspaper=[[Rockhampton Bulletin]] |location=Qld. |date=21 May 1872 |access-date=1 May 2012 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Two years later, the university was inaugurated on 11 October 1852 in the Big Schoolroom of what is now [[Sydney Grammar School]]. The first principal was [[John Woolley (educator)|John Woolley]],<ref>

In 1858, the passage of the ''Electoral Act'' provided for the university to become a constituency for the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] as soon as there were 100 graduates of the university holding higher degrees eligible for candidacy. This [[Electoral district of University of Sydney|seat in the New South Wales legislature]] was first filled in 1876, but was abolished in 1880, one year after its second member, Sir [[Edmund Barton]], who later became the first [[Prime Minister of Australia]], was elected to the Legislative Assembly.

Most of the estate of [[John Henry Challis]] was bequeathed to the university, which received a sum of £200,000 in 1889. This was thanks in part due to Sir [[William Montagu Manning]] (chancellor 1878–95) who argued against the claims by British tax commissioners. The following year, seven professorships were created in anatomy, zoology, engineering, history, law, logic and mental philosophy, and modern literature.

In 1924, the university awarded its first Doctor of Science in Engineering degree to [[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]]. His thesis was titled "The City and Suburban Electric Railways and the Sydney Harbour Bridge". Bradfield would go on to be the lead engineer for the construction of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bradfield|first=John Jacob Crew|date=1924|title=The City and Suburban Electric Railways and the Sydney Harbour Bridge|url=https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/11968|url-status=live|access-date=15 October 2021|website=Sydney eScholarship|publisher=University of Sydney}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-12-11|title=Sydney Harbour Bridge Guide|url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/sydney-harbour-bridge-guide|access-date=2021-10-15|website=www.records.nsw.gov.au|language=en}}</ref>

The university's professor of philosophy from 1927 to 1958, [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]], was a significant figure referred to as "Sydney's best known academic".<ref name="Franklin 2003">Franklin, James 2003, 'Corrupting the Youth: A history of philosophy in Australia', Macleay Press</ref> A native of [[Scotland]], Anderson's controversial views as a self-proclaimed [[atheist]] and advocate of [[Freethought|free thought]] in all subjects raised the ire of many, even to the point of being censured by the state legislature in 1943.<ref name="Franklin 2003" />

===1950–2000===
The PhD research degree was first discussed in 1944, and began in 1947. The university awarded the first PhD in 1951 to [[Bill Wittrick|William H. Wittrick]] from the Faculty of Engineering on 28 April 1951 and the next two were awarded to Eleanora C. Gyarfas and George F. Humphrey from the Faculty of Science on 2 May 1951.<ref>{{Cite web|last=University Archives and Records Management Services|date=2008|title=The University of Sydney Record 2007-08|url=https://www.sydney.edu.au/content/dam/corporate/documents/university-archives/record/record-2007-08.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=3 June 2021|website=University of Sydney Archives}}</ref>

The [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] University College was founded as part of the University of Sydney in 1938 and in 1954 was separated to become the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].

During the late 1960s, the University of Sydney was at the centre of rows to introduce courses on [[Marxism]] and [[feminism]] at the major Australian universities. At one stage, newspaper reporters descended on the university to cover brawls, demonstrations, secret memos and a walk-out by [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], a  philosopher who held the Challis Chair of Philosophy from 1959 to 1991, after students at one of his lectures openly demanded a course on feminism.<ref>{{cite news |last = West |first = William |title = Argumentative days over | newspaper = The Australian |date = 1 January 1992 |page = 15, Higher Education Supplement }}</ref> The philosophy department split over the issue into the Traditional and Modern Philosophy Department, headed by Armstrong and following a more [[analytic philosophy|traditional approach to philosophy]], and the General Philosophy Department, which follows the French [[continental philosophy|continental approach]]. The [[Builders Labourers Federation]] placed a ban on the university after two women tutors were not allowed to teach a course but the issue was quickly resolved internally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/list-green-bans-1971-1974|title=List of green bans, 1971-1974|website=libcom.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> 

Under the terms of the ''Higher Education (Amalgamation) Act 1989'' (NSW),<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hea1989248/ |title = HIGHER EDUCATION (AMALGAMATION) ACT 1989 |website=Austlii.edu.au |date=20 June 2006 |access-date=22 February 2010 }}</ref> the following bodies were incorporated into the university in 1990:

* Sydney branch of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]]
* [[Cumberland College of Health Sciences]]
* [[Sydney College of the Arts]] of the Institute of the Arts
* [[Sydney Institute of Education]] of the [[Sydney College of Advanced Education]] (prior to 1981, named the [[Sydney Teachers College]]). 
* Institute of Nursing Studies of the Sydney College of Advanced Education
* Guild Centre of the Sydney College of Advanced Education.

The Orange Agricultural College (OAC) was originally transferred to the [[University of New England, Australia|University of New England]] under the act, but then transferred to the University of Sydney in 1994, as part of the reforms to the University of New England undertaken by the ''University of New England Act 1993''<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/uonea1993281/ |title = UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND ACT 1993 |website = Austlii.edu.au |date=22 September 2008 |access-date=22 February 2010}}</ref> and the ''Southern Cross University Act 1993''.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/scua1993354/ |title = SOUTHERN CROSS UNIVERSITY ACT 1993 |website = Austlii.edu.au |date=22 September 2008 |access-date=22 February 2010}}</ref> In January 2005, the University of Sydney transferred the OAC to [[Charles Sturt University]].

===2000–present===
In February 2007, the university agreed to acquire a portion of the land granted to [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St John's College]] to develop the Sydney Institute of Health and Medical Research, now the [[Charles Perkins Centre]], the first new research building to be built on campus in over 40 years. As a Roman Catholic institution, in handing over the land, St John's placed limitations on the type of medical research which could be conducted on the premises, seeking to preserve the essence of the college's mission. This caused concern among some groups who argued that it would interfere with scientific medical research. However, this was rejected by the university's administration because the building was not intended for this purpose and there were many other facilities in close proximity where such research could take place.

[[File:Charles Perkins Centre interior, Sydney.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Perkins Centre]]]]

In 2010, the university received a [[Pablo Picasso]] painting from the private collection of an anonymous donor. The painting, ''[[Jeune Fille Endormie]]'', which had not been publicly seen since 1939, depicts the artist's lover, [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]] and was donated on the strict understanding that it would be sold and the proceeds directed to medical research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/perkins/partners/picasso.shtml|title=Donate|website=The University of Sydney|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> In June 2011, the painting was auctioned at [[Christie's]] in London and sold for £13.5&nbsp;million ($20.6&nbsp;million AUD). The proceeds of the sale funded the establishment of many endowed professorial chairs at the [[Charles Perkins Centre]], where a room dedicated to the painting, now exists.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newscategoryid=11&newsstoryid=7151 |title = Picasso masterpiece raises A$20.6 million to fund Sydney research |website=sydney.edu.au |access-date=23 July 2018 }}</ref>

At the start of 2010, the university controversially adopted a new logo. It retains the same university arms, however it takes on a more modern look. There have been stylistic changes, the main one being the coat of arm's [[mantling]], the shape of the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield), the removal of the motto scroll, and also others more subtle within the arms itself, such as the mane and fur of the lion, the number of lines in the open book and the colouration.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newscategoryid=9&newsstoryid=4371 |title=New decade, new dynamic &#124; The University of Sydney |website=sydney.edu.au |date=8 January 2010 |access-date=22 February 2010 }}</ref> The original Coat of Arms from 1857 continues to be used for ceremonial and other formal purposes, such as on testamurs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://sydney.edu.au/ab/about/2009/VC_Rpt_to_Senate_0609.pdf |title=Report of the Vice-Chancellor and Principal |date=15 June 2009 |access-date=12 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://sydney.edu.au/alumni/sam/archive/SAM_March10.pdf |title=Sydney Alumni Magazine |website=sydney.edu.au |date=March 2010 |access-date=12 June 2011 }}</ref>

Concerns about public funding for higher education were reflected again in 2014 following the federal government's [[Abbott Government#University and TAFE deregulation|proposal to deregulate student fees]]. The university held a wide-ranging consultation process, which included a "town hall meeting" at the university's Great Hall 25 August 2014, where an audience of students, staff and alumni expressed deep concern about the government's plans and called on university leadership to lobby against the proposals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/overwhelming-opposition-to-fee-deregulation-at-historic-university-of-sydney-town-hall-meeting-20140826-108btl.html |title=Overwhelming opposition to fee deregulation at historic University of Sydney town hall meeting |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 August 2014 |access-date=16 July 2015}}</ref> Throughout 2014, [[Michael Spence (legal scholar)|Michael Spence]] took a leading position among Australian vice-chancellors in repeatedly calling for any change to funding to not undermine equitable access to university while arguing for fee deregulation to raise course costs for the majority of higher education students.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smh.com.au/comment/middle-income-families-the-losers-in-race-to-university-20140528-zrqgy.html |title=Middle income families the losers in race to university |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=28 May 2014 |access-date=16 July 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2014/s4075107.htm |title = Lateline – 26/08/2014: Universities too reliant on international student fees |date = 26 August 2014 |publisher=ABC |access-date=16 July 2015}}</ref>

In order to further enhance its competitiveness locally and internationally, the university has introduced plans to consolidate existing degrees to reduce the overall number of programs.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.smh.com.au/education/university-of-sydney-to-cut-100-degrees-and-triple-research-investment-20160331-gnv1fc.html |title=University of Sydney to cut 100 degrees and triple research investment|last=Bagshaw|first=Eryk|date=2016-03-31|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>

===Controversies===

In 2005, the [[Public Service Association of New South Wales]] and the [[Community and Public Sector Union]] were in dispute with the university over a proposal to privatise security at the main campus (and the [[Cumberland]] campus).<ref>Public Service Association of NSW, [http://www.psa.labor.net.au/campaigns/1124934892_16999.html ''Sydney University Petition on Security Services''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304220002/http://www.psa.labor.net.au/campaigns/1124934892_16999.html |date=4 March 2007 }}.

Action initiated by Spence to improve the financial sustainability of the university has alienated some students and staff.<ref name="The man, the myth, the manager">Max Chalmers (10 March 2014). "[http://honisoit.com/2014/03/the-man-the-myth-the-manager/ The man, the myth, the manager]".

This included redundancies of a number of university staff and faculty, though some at the university argued that the institution should cut back on building programs instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/academics-argue-vc-has-not-made-his-case/story-e6frgcjx-1226296360644|title=Academics argue VC has not made his case|author=Stephen Matchett|work=The Australian|date=12 March 2012|access-date=12 February 2013}}</ref> Critics argue the push for savings has been driven by managerial incompetence and indifference,<ref name="The man, the myth, the manager" /> fuelling industrial action during a round of enterprise bargaining in 2013 that also reflected widespread concerns about public funding for higher education.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nteu.org.au/sydney/article/FAQs-for-Strike-Day---March-26-and-March-27-14288 | title= FAQs for Strike Day – March 26 and March 27 | first= Kate | last= Barnsley | date= 22 March 2013 | access-date = 24 March 2013}}</ref>

In the first week of semester, some staff passed a motion of no confidence in Spence because of concerns he was pushing staff to improve the budget while he received a performance bonus of $155,000 that took his total pay to $1&nbsp;million, in the top 0.1 per cent of income earners in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.solidarity.net.au/mag/back/2012/45/‘michael-spence-is-the-1-per-cent’-the-role-of-university-management/ |title=Michael Spence is the 1 per cent': the role of university management |author=Adam Adelpour|website=Solidarity Online|date=16 May 2012}}.</ref> ''[[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]]'' reports Spence and other Uni bosses have salary packages worth ten times more than staff salaries and double that of the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/tertiary-education/uni-bosses-earn-10-times-more-than-staff-20130824-2sihh.html|title=Uni bosses earn 10 times more than staff|author=Amy McNeilage|publisher=Daily Life|date=23 August 2013}}.</ref>

During Spence's term, the university community was divided over allowing students from an elite private school, [[Scots College (Sydney)|Scots College]], to enter university via a "pathway of privilege" by means of enrolling in a Diploma of Tertiary Preparation rather than meeting HSC entry requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/scots-boys-got-into-sydney-university-without-hsc-20150405-1medae.html|title=Scots boys got into Sydney University without HSC|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 April 2015|access-date=16 July 2015}}</ref> The university charged students $12,000 to take the course and have since successfully admitted a number of students to degree courses.

==Campus==
===Main campus===
[[File:University of Sydney's Main Quadrangle.jpg|thumb|The Main Campus]]
The main campus has been ranked in the top 10 of the world's most beautiful universities by the British ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and the American ''[[Huffington Post]]'', among others such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and is spread across the inner-city suburbs of Camperdown and Darlington.<ref name="The Daily Telegraph">{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/9480575/Beautiful-universities-around-the-world.html?frame=2312132 |location=London |newspaper = The Daily Telegraph |title = Beautiful universities around the world |date=31 August 2012 }}</ref><ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk">{{cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/11/worlds-most-beautiful-universities_n_3578402.html#slide=2682402 |title = 15 of the World's Most Beautiful Universities Revealed |website = The Huffington Post UK |date = 11 July 2013 }}</ref>
[[File:The Great Hall, Sydney Uni.jpg|thumb|[[The Great Hall, the University of Sydney|The Great Hall]]]]
[[File:USYD Quadrangle (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[University of Sydney Quadrangle|The Quadrangle]]]]
Originally housed in what is now [[Sydney Grammar School]], in 1855 the government granted land in Grose Farm to the university, three kilometres from the city, which is now the main [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] campus. In 1854, the architect [[Edmund Blacket]] accepted a senate invitation for the first buildings to be designed. In 1858 the [[Great Hall of the University of Sydney|Great Hall]] was finished, and in 1859 the Main Building was built. He composed the original Neo-Gothic sandstone Quadrangle and Great Tower buildings, which were completed in 1862.<ref name=":1" /> The rapid expansion of the university in the mid-20th century resulted in the acquisition of land in Darlington across [[City Road, Sydney|City Road]]. The Camperdown/Darlington campus houses the university's administrative headquarters, and the Faculties of Arts, Science, Education and Social Work, Pharmacy, Veterinary Science, Economics and Business, Architecture, and Engineering. It is also the home base of the large [[Sydney Medical School]], which has numerous affiliated teaching hospitals across the state.

The main campus is also the focus of the university's student life, with the student-run [[University of Sydney Union]] (once referred to as "the Union", but now known as "the USU") in possession of three buildings – Wentworth, Manning and Holme Buildings. These buildings house a large proportion of the university's catering outlets, and provide space for recreational rooms, bars and function centres. One of the largest activities organised by the Union is Welcome Week (formerly Orientation Week or 'O-week'<ref>"[http://honisoit.com/2019/02/whats-in-a-name-o-week-becomes-welcome-week/ What's in a name? O-Week becomes Welcome Week"]. ''Honi Soit''. Retrieved 28/6/19.</ref>), a three-day festival at the start of the academic year. Welcome Week centres on stalls set up by clubs and societies on the Front Lawns.

The main campus is home to a variety of statues, artworks, and monuments. These include the [[Gilgamesh Statue (University of Sydney)|Gilgamesh Statue]] and the Confucius Statue.

Some other architects associated with the university were [[Walter Liberty Vernon]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Leslie Wilkinson]], and the [[New South Wales Government Architect]].<ref name=":1" /> The building was designed in accordance with the university's masterplanning by the architect and founding dean of the university's architecture faculty Leslie Wilkinson, who himself was inspired by a previously unused masterplan developed for the campus by Walter Burley Griffin in 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://architectureau.com/articles/grimshaw-completes-gateway-administration-building-for-university-of-sydney/ |title=Grimshaw completes 'gateway' administration building for University of Sydney |website=ArchitectureAU |access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>
[[File:USYD MacLaurin Hall A14D SEP2019.jpg|thumb|The MacLaurin Hall]]
The 2002 conservation plan of the university stated that the Main Building and Quadrangle, Anderson Stuart Building, Gate Lodges, St Paul's College, St John's College and St Andrew's College "comprise what is arguably the most important group of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival style architecture]] in Australia, and the landscape and grounds features associated with these buildings, including [[Victoria Park, Sydney|Victoria Park]], contribute to and support the existence and appreciation of their architectural qualities and aesthetic significance."<ref name=":1" />

In 2015, [[Department of Planning and Environment (New South Wales)|The NSW Department of Planning and Environment]] endorsed The University of Sydney's $1.4&nbsp;billion Campus Improvement Plan which involved a number of new important structures and renovations.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://architectureau.com/articles/green-light-for-sydney-unis-14-billion-masterplan/ |title = Green light for Sydney Uni's $1.4 billion masterplan |website=ArchitectureAU |access-date=2019-06-14 }}</ref>
[[File:Physics Road, University of Sydney.jpg|thumb|Sports fields along Physics Road]]
As of 2016, the university is undertaking a large capital works program with the aim of revitalising the campus and providing more office, teaching and student space.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.facilities.usyd.edu.au/c2010/about/summary.shtml |title = Campus 2010 + Building for the Future |website = Facilities.usyd.edu.au |access-date=11 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111006161840/http://www.facilities.usyd.edu.au/c2010/about/summary.shtml |archive-date=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The program will see the amalgamation of the smaller science and technical libraries into a larger library, and the construction of a central administration and student services building along City Road. A new building for the School of Information Technologies opened in late 2006 and has been located on a site adjacent to the [[Seymour Centre]]. The busy Eastern Avenue thoroughfare has been transformed into a pedestrian plaza and a new footbridge has been built over City Road. The new home for the [[Sydney Law School]], located alongside Fisher Library on the site of the old [[Edgeworth David]] and Stephen Roberts buildings, has been completed. The university opened a new building called "Abercrombie Building" for business school students in early 2016.

The NSW state government has reduced transport links to the old campus and the closest [[Redfern railway station]] leaving main access to buses on the neighbouring [[Parramatta Road]] and [[City Road, Sydney|City Road]], prioritising the growth at other Sydney universities.<ref>{{cite news |title = Sydney Uni lashes out at government over 'serious impact' of train timetable changes |url = http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-uni-lashes-out-at-government-over-serious-impact-of-train-timetable-changes-20171130-gzvpoq.html |newspaper = The Sydney Morning Herald |date=30 November 2017 }}</ref>

From 2007, the university has used space in the former [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]] railway yards, just to the south of [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]], for examination purposes.

In 2018, [[Minister for Heritage (New South Wales)|New South Wales Minister for Heritage]], [[Gabrielle Upton]] agreed to put the University of Sydney and some adjacent sites on the state heritage register, creating a conservation area that would include the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] campus, and the nearby [[Victoria Park, Sydney|Victoria Park]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url = https://architectureau.com/articles/university-of-sydney-receives-state-heritage-listing/ |title=University of Sydney receives state heritage listing |website=ArchitectureAU |access-date=2019-05-08 }}</ref>

The beginning of 2021 saw the closure of the Cumberland campus, with multiple health disciplines returning to the Camperdown campus in the state-of-the-art, purpose built Susan Wakil Health Building.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/locations-and-facilities/susan-wakil-health-building.html |title=Susan Wakil Health Building |publisher=University of Sydney |access-date=2021-02-03 }}</ref>

==Coat of arms==
[[File:University of Sydney.svg|thumb|right|Arms used in the University of Sydney logo, pre-2010]]

The Grant of Arms was made by the [[College of Arms]] in 1857. The grant reads:
:''Argent on a Cross Azure an open book proper, clasps Gold, between four Stars of eight points Or, on a chief Gules a Lion passant Guardant also Or, together with this motto "Sidere mens eadem mutato" to be borne and used forever hereafter by the said University of Sydney on their Common Seal, Shields or otherwise according to the Law of Arms.''

The use of eight-pointed stars was unusual for arms at the time, although they had been used unofficially as emblems for New South Wales since the 1820s and on the arms of the Church of England Diocese of Australia in 1836.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/10_subnav_08_01_06.htm|title=The Badge of New South Wales as adopted in 1876|publisher=Heritage Council of New South Wales|access-date=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312033950/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/10_subnav_08_01_06.htm|archive-date=12 March 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to the university, the Latin motto ''Sidere mens eadem mutato'' can be translated to "the stars change, the mind remains the same."<ref name="logo"/> [[Francis Merewether (Australian politician)|Francis Merewether]], Vice-Chancellor and later Chancellor, in 1857 proposed "Coelum non animum mutant" from Horace (Ep.1.11.27) but after objections changed it to a metrical version including "Sidus" (Star), a neat reference to the [[Southern Cross]] and perhaps the Sydney family link with Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s "Astrophel (Star-Lover) & Stella (Star)".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/heraldry/origins_of_the_arms/quest_for_a_coat.shtml|title=Quest for a coat of arms – Heraldry – The University of Sydney|last=Services|first=Archives and Records Management|website=sydney.edu.au|access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref> Author and university alumnus [[Clive James]] quipped in his 1981 autobiography that the motto loosely implies "Sydney University is really Oxford or Cambridge laterally displaced approximately 12,000 miles."<ref>{{Citation|last=James|first=Clive|title=Unreliable memoirs|year=1981|publisher=Pan Books|isbn=978-0-330-26463-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/unreliablememoir00cliv/page/127 127]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/unreliablememoir00cliv/page/127}}</ref>

==Student organisations==
<!-- NOTABLE student organisations ONLY -->

[[File:Usydoweek.jpg|thumb|Welcome Week at the university place]]

* '''Student Representatives''': Politically and academically, undergraduate students are represented by the [[University of Sydney Students' Representative Council]] (SRC) and postgraduate students by the [[Sydney University Postgraduate Representative Association]] (SUPRA).
* '''[[University of Sydney Union]]''': The University of Sydney Union (USU) is the oldest and largest university union in Australia. USU provides a range of activities, programs, services and facilities geared at giving students the university experience. This involves delivering clubs and societies program, a varied entertainment program, student opportunities, a range of catering and retail services plus buildings and recreational spaces for students, staff and visitors.

The SRC and Union are both governed by student representatives, who are elected by students each year. Elections for the USU board of directors occur in first semester; elections for the SRC President, and for members of the Students' Representative Council itself, occur in second semester, along with a separate election for the editorial board of the student newspaper ''[[Honi Soit]]'', which is published by the SRC. The elections are usually closely contested, and result in much of the main campus being covered with chalk messages from the various candidates.

In February 2017, individuals who wanted to serve and get on the University of Sydney student council needed to sign a [[statutory declaration]] - openly declaring that they are gay, lesbian, bi, trans, intersex or non-binary to automatically fill hard-line "diversity quotas".<ref>[https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/im-gay-i-swear]</ref>
