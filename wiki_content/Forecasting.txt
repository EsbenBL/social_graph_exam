{{short description|Making predictions based on available data}}
'''Forecasting''' is the process of making predictions based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends. A commonplace example might be [[estimation]] of some variable of interest at some specified future date. [[Prediction]] is a similar, but more general term. Both might refer to formal statistical methods employing [[time series]], [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] or [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] data, or alternatively to less formal judgmental methods. Usage can differ between areas of application: for example, in [[hydrology]] the terms "forecast" and "forecasting" are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific [[future]] times, while the term "prediction" is used for more general estimates, such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period.

[[Risk]] and [[uncertainty]] are central to forecasting and prediction; it is generally considered good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attaching to forecasts. In any case, the data must be up to date in order for the forecast to be as accurate as possible. In some cases the data used to predict the variable of interest is itself forecast.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=French|first1=Jordan|title=The time traveller's CAPM|journal=Investment Analysts Journal|date=2017|volume=46|issue=2|pages=81–96|doi=10.1080/10293523.2016.1255469|s2cid=157962452}}</ref>

==Categories of forecasting methods==

===Qualitative vs. quantitative methods===

Qualitative forecasting techniques are subjective, based on the opinion and judgment of consumers and experts; they are appropriate when past data are not available.
They are usually applied to intermediate- or long-range decisions. Examples of qualitative forecasting methods are {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} informed opinion and judgment, the [[Delphi method]], [[market research]], and historical life-cycle analogy.

Quantitative forecasting [[mathematical model|models]] are used to forecast future data as a function of past data. They are appropriate to use when past numerical data is available and when it is reasonable to assume that some of the patterns in the data are expected to continue into the future.
These methods are usually applied to short- or intermediate-range decisions. Examples of quantitative forecasting methods are{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} last period demand, simple and weighted N-Period [[moving average]]s, simple [[exponential smoothing]], poisson process model based forecasting<ref>{{cite conference |title= A poisson process model for activity forecasting |last1= Mahmud |first1= Tahmida |last2= Hasan |first2= Mahmudul |last3= Chakraborty |first3= Anirban |last4= Roy-Chowdhury |first4= Amit |date= 19 August 2016 |publisher= IEEE |conference= 2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) |doi= 10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532978 }}</ref> and multiplicative seasonal indexes. Previous research shows that different methods may lead to different level of forecasting accuracy. For example, [[Group method of data handling|GMDH]] neural network was found to have  better forecasting performance than the classical forecasting algorithms such as Single Exponential Smooth, Double Exponential Smooth, ARIMA and back-propagation neural network.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/14445921.2016.1225149|title = Forecasting the REITs and stock indices: Group Method of Data Handling Neural Network approach| journal=Pacific Rim Property Research Journal| volume=23| issue=2| pages=123–160|year = 2017|last1 = Li|first1 = Rita Yi Man| last2=Fong| first2=Simon| last3=Chong| first3=Kyle Weng Sang|s2cid = 157150897}}</ref>

===Average approach===

In this approach, the predictions of all future values are equal to the mean of the past data. This approach can be used with any sort of data where past data is available. In time series notation:

:<math>\hat{y}_{T+h|T} = \bar{y} = ( y_1 + ... + y_T ) / T </math> <ref name="otexts.org">{{cite book|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/3|title=2.3 Some simple forecasting methods - OTexts|website=www.otexts.org|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref>

where <math>y_1, ... , y_T</math> is the past data.

Although the time series notation has been used here, the average approach can also be used for cross-sectional data (when we are predicting unobserved values; values that are not included in the data set). Then, the prediction for unobserved values is the average of the observed values.

===Naïve approach===

Naïve forecasts are the most cost-effective forecasting model, and provide a benchmark against which more sophisticated models can be compared. This forecasting method is only suitable for time series [[data]].<ref name="otexts.org" /> Using the naïve approach, forecasts are produced that are equal to the last observed value. This method works quite well for economic and financial time series, which often have patterns that are difficult to reliably and accurately predict.<ref name="otexts.org"/> If the time series is believed to have seasonality, the seasonal naïve approach may be more appropriate where the forecasts are equal to the value from last season. In time series notation:

:<math>\hat{y}_{T+h|T} = y_T </math>

===Drift method===
A variation on the naïve method is to allow the forecasts to increase or decrease over time, where the amount of change over time (called the [[Stochastic drift|drift]]) is set to be the average change seen in the historical data. So the forecast for time <math>T+h</math> is given by

:<math>\hat{y}_{T+h|T} = y_T + \frac{h}{T-1}\sum_{t=2}^T (y_{t}-y_{t-1}) = y_{T}+h\left(\frac{y_{T}-y_{1}}{T-1}\right).</math>  <ref name="otexts.org"/>

This is equivalent to drawing a line between the first and last observation, and extrapolating it into the future.

===Seasonal naïve approach===

The seasonal naïve method accounts for seasonality by setting each prediction to be equal to the last observed value of the same season. For example, the prediction value for all subsequent months of April will be equal to the previous value observed for April. The forecast for time <math>T + h</math> is<ref name="otexts.org"/>

:<math>\hat{y}_{T+h|T} = y_{T+h-m(k+1)}</math>
where <math>m</math>=seasonal period and <math>k</math> is the smallest integer greater than <math>(h-1) / m</math>.

The seasonal naïve method is particularly useful for data that has a very high level of seasonality.

===Time series methods===

[[Time series]] methods use historical data as the basis of estimating future outcomes.
They are based on the assumption that past demand history is a good indicator of future demand.

*[[Moving average]]
*[[Weighted moving average]]
*[[Exponential smoothing]]
*[[Autoregressive–moving-average model|Autoregressive moving average (ARMA)]] (forecasts depend on past values of the variable being forecast and on past prediction errors)
*[[Autoregressive integrated moving average|Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)]] (ARMA on the period-to-period change in the forecast variable)
:e.g. [[Box–Jenkins]] 
:Seasonal ARIMA or SARIMA or ARIMARCH,
*[[Extrapolation]]
*[[Linear prediction]]
*[[Trend estimation]] (predicting the variable as a linear or polynomial function of time)
*[[Growth curve (statistics)]]
*[[Recurrent neural network]]

===Relational methods===

Some forecasting methods try to identify the underlying factors that might influence the variable that is being forecast. For example, including information about climate patterns might improve the ability of a model to predict umbrella sales. Forecasting models often take account of regular seasonal variations. In addition to climate, such variations can also be due to holidays and customs: for example, one might predict that sales of college football apparel will be higher during the football season than during the off season.<ref name="NahmiasOlsen2015">{{cite book|author1=Steven Nahmias|author2=Tava Lennon Olsen|title=Production and Operations Analysis: Seventh Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIsoBgAAQBAJ&q=forecasting|date=15 January 2015|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=978-1-4786-2824-8}}</ref>

Several informal methods used in causal forecasting do not rely solely on the output of mathematical [[algorithm]]s, but instead use the judgment of the forecaster. Some forecasts take account of past relationships between variables: if one variable has, for example, been approximately linearly related to another for a long period of time, it may be appropriate to extrapolate such a relationship into the future, without necessarily understanding the reasons for the relationship.

Causal methods include:

*[[Regression analysis]] includes a large group of methods for predicting future values of a variable using information about other variables. These methods include both [[parametric statistics|parametric]] (linear or non-linear) and [[Nonparametric regression|non-parametric]] techniques.
*[[ARMAX|Autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX)]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Kimberly|title=Production Planning and Inventory Control Virginia Tech|year=2008|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-390-87106-0}}</ref>

Quantitative forecasting models are often judged against each other by comparing their in-sample or out-of-sample [[mean square error]], although some researchers have advised against this.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/armstrong-errormeasures-empirical.pdf | title = Error Measures For Generalizing About Forecasting Methods: Empirical Comparisons | author = [[J.

For example, it was found in one context that [[GMDH]] has higher forecasting accuracy than traditional ARIMA<ref>16.	Li, Rita Yi Man, Fong, S., Chong, W.S.

===Judgmental methods===

Judgmental forecasting methods incorporate intuitive judgement, opinions and subjective [[probability]] estimates. Judgmental forecasting is used in cases where there is lack of historical data or during completely new and unique market conditions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/3/1|title=3.1 Introduction - OTexts|website=www.otexts.org|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref>

Judgmental methods include:

*Composite forecasts{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
*Cooke's method{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
*[[Delphi method]]
*[[Forecast by analogy]]
*[[Scenario planning|Scenario building]]
*[[Statistical survey]]s
*[[Technology forecasting]]

===Artificial intelligence methods===
*[[Artificial neural networks]]
*[[Group method of data handling]]
*[[Support vector machine]]s

Often these are done today by specialized programs loosely labeled
*[[Data mining]]
*[[Machine learning]]
*[[Pattern recognition]]

===Geometric Extrapolation with error prediction===

Can be created with 3 points of a sequence and the "moment" or "index", this type of extrapolation have 100 % accuracy in predictions in a big percentage of known series database (OEIS).
<ref>{{cite journal | title = Geometric Extrapolation of Integer Sequences | author = V. Nos | year = 2021 | url = https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Probnet }}</ref>

===Other methods===
*[[Granger causality]]
*[[Simulation]]
*[[Prediction market]]
*[[Probabilistic forecasting]] and [[Ensemble forecasting]]

==Forecasting accuracy==

The forecast error (also known as a [[errors and residuals|residual]]) is the difference between the actual value and the forecast value for the corresponding period:

:<math>\ E_t = Y_t - F_t </math>

where E is the forecast error at period t, Y is the actual value at period t, and F is the forecast for period t.

A good forecasting method will yield residuals that are '''uncorrelated'''. If there are [[correlation]]s between residual values, then there is information left in the residuals which should be used in computing forecasts. This can be accomplished by computing the expected value of a residual as a function of the known past residuals, and adjusting the forecast by the amount by which this expected value differs from zero.

A good forecasting method will also have '''zero mean'''. If the residuals have a mean other than zero, then the forecasts are biased and can be improved by adjusting the forecasting technique by an additive constant that equals the mean of the unadjusted residuals.

Measures of aggregate error:

===Scaled-dependent errors===
The forecast error, E, is on the same scale as the data, as such, these accuracy measures are scale-dependent and cannot be used to make comparisons between series on different scales.

[[Mean absolute error]] (MAE) or [[average absolute deviation|mean absolute deviation]] (MAD): <math>\ MAE = MAD = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N} |E_t|}{N} </math>

[[Mean squared error]] (MSE) or [[mean squared prediction error]] (MSPE): <math>\ MSE = MSPE = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^N {E_t^2}}{N} </math>

[[Root-mean-square deviation|Root mean squared error]] (RMSE): <math>\ RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^N {E_t^2}}{N}} </math>

Average of Errors (E): <math>\ \bar{E}=  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N {E_i}}{N} </math>

===Percentage errors===
These are more frequently used to compare forecast performance between different data sets because they are scale-independent. However, they have the disadvantage of being extremely large or undefined if Y is close to or equal to zero.

[[Mean absolute percentage error]] (MAPE): <math>\ MAPE = 100* \frac{\sum_{t=1}^N |\frac{E_t}{Y_t}|}{N} </math>

Mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD): <math>\ MAPD = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N} |E_t|}{\sum_{t=1}^{N} |Y_t|} </math>

===Scaled errors===
Hyndman and Koehler (2006) proposed using scaled errors as an alternative to percentage errors.

[[Mean absolute scaled error]] (MASE): <math>MASE = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N} |\frac{E_t}{\frac{1}{N-m}\sum_{t=m+1}^{N}|Y_t - Y_{t-m}|}|}{N}</math>

where ''m''=seasonal period or 1 if non-seasonal

===Other measures===
[[Forecast skill]] (SS): <math>\ SS = 1- \frac{MSE_{forecast}}{MSE_{ref}} </math>

Business forecasters and practitioners sometimes use different terminology. They refer to the PMAD as the MAPE, although they compute this as a volume weighted MAPE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forecastingblog.com/?p=134|title=Response to MAPE and MPE Calculations - Mark Chockalingam - Forecasting Blog|date=25 October 2010|website=forecastingblog.com|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref> For more information see [[Calculating demand forecast accuracy]].

When comparing the accuracy of different forecasting methods on a specific data set, the measures of aggregate error are compared with each other and the method that yields the lowest error is preferred.

===Training and test sets===

When evaluating the quality of forecasts, it is invalid to look at how well a model fits the historical data; the accuracy of forecasts can only be determined by considering how well a model performs on new data that were not used when fitting the model. When choosing models, it is common to use a portion of the available data for fitting, and use the rest of the data for testing the model, as was done in the above examples.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5|title=2.5 Evaluating forecast accuracy {{!}} OTexts|website=www.otexts.org|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref>

===Cross-validation===

[[cross-validation (statistics)|Cross-validation]] is a more sophisticated version of training a test set.

For [[cross-sectional data]], one approach to cross-validation works as follows:
# Select observation ''i'' for the test set, and use the remaining observations in the training set. Compute the error on the test observation.
# Repeat the above step for  ''i'' = 1,2,..., ''N'' where ''N'' is the total number of observations.
# Compute the forecast accuracy measures based on the errors obtained.
This makes efficient use of the available data, as only one observation is omitted at each step

For time series data, the training set can only include observations prior to the test set. Therefore, no future observations can be used in constructing the forecast. Suppose ''k'' observations are needed to produce a reliable forecast; then the process works as follows:
# Starting with ''i''=1, select the observation ''k + i''  for the test set, and use the observations at times  1, 2, ..., ''k+i''–1 to estimate the forecasting model. Compute the error on the forecast for ''k+i''.
# Repeat the above step for ''i'' = 2,...,''T–k''  where ''T'' is the total number of observations.
# Compute the forecast accuracy over all errors.
This procedure is sometimes known as a "rolling forecasting origin" because the "origin" (''k+i -1)'' at which the forecast is based rolls forward in time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5|title=2.5 Evaluating forecast accuracy {{!}} OTexts|website=www.otexts.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> Further, two-step-ahead or in general ''p''-step-ahead forecasts can be computed by first forecasting the value immediately after the training set, then using this value with the training set values to forecast two periods ahead, etc.

==Seasonality and cyclic behaviour==

===Seasonality===

{{Main|Seasonality}}

Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year. Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one-year period can be said to be seasonal. It is common in many situations – such as grocery store<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Erhun | first1 = F. | last2 = Tayur | first2 = S. | doi = 10.1287/opre.51.3.343.14953 | title = Enterprise-Wide Optimization of Total Landed Cost at a Grocery Retailer | journal = Operations Research | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 343 | year = 2003 | doi-access = free }}</ref> or even in a Medical Examiner's office<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/097206340700900105| title = Forecasting as an Operations Management Tool in a Medical Examiner's Office| journal = Journal of Health Management| volume = 9| pages = 75–84| year = 2007| last1 = Omalu | first1 = B. I.| last2 = Shakir | first2 = A. M.| last3 = Lindner | first3 = J. L.| last4 = Tayur | first4 = S. R.| s2cid = 73325253}}</ref>—that the demand depends on the day of the week. In such situations, the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the “season” – seven seasons, one for each day – which is the ratio of the average demand of that season (which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using  historical data corresponding only to that season) to the  average demand across all seasons. An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average.

===Cyclic behaviour===

The cyclic behaviour of data takes place when there are regular fluctuations in the data which usually last for an interval of at least two years, and when the length of the current cycle cannot be predetermined. Cyclic behavior is not to be confused with seasonal behavior. Seasonal fluctuations follow a consistent pattern each year so the period is always known. As an example, during the Christmas period, inventories of stores tend to increase in order to prepare for Christmas shoppers. As an example of cyclic behaviour, the population of a particular natural ecosystem will exhibit cyclic behaviour when the population decreases as its natural food source decreases, and once the population is low, the food source will recover and the population will start to increase again. Cyclic data cannot be accounted for using ordinary seasonal adjustment since it is not of fixed period.

==Applications==

Forecasting has applications in a wide range of fields where estimates of future conditions are useful. Not everything can be forecast reliably, if the factors that relate to what is being forecast are known and well understood and there is a significant amount of data that can be used very reliable forecasts can often be obtained. If this is not the case or if the actual outcome is affected by the forecasts, the reliability of the forecasts can be significantly lower.<ref name="https://www.otexts.org/fpp/1/1">{{Cite book | url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/1/1 | title=Forecasting: Principles and Practice}}</ref>

Climate change and increasing energy prices have led to the use of [[Egain Forecasting]] for buildings. This attempts to reduce the energy needed to heat the building, thus reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Forecasting is used in [[customer demand planning]] in everyday business for manufacturing and distribution companies.

While the veracity of predictions for actual stock returns are disputed through reference to the [[Efficient-market hypothesis]], forecasting of broad economic trends is common.

Forecasting [[exchange rate|foreign exchange]] movements is typically achieved through a combination of chart and [[fundamental analysis]].

==Limitations==

Limitations pose barriers beyond which forecasting methods cannot reliably predict.
There are many events and values that cannot be forecast reliably. Events such as the roll of a die or the results of the lottery cannot be forecast because they are random events and there is no significant relationship in the data. When the factors that lead to what is being forecast are not known or well understood such as in [[Stock market|stock]] and [[foreign exchange market]]s forecasts are often inaccurate or wrong as there is not enough data about everything that affects these markets for the forecasts to be reliable, in addition the outcomes of the forecasts of these markets change the behavior of those involved in the market further reducing forecast accuracy.<ref name="https://www.otexts.org/fpp/1/1"/>

The concept of "self-destructing predictions" concerns the way in which some predictions can undermine themselves by influencing social behavior.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2019-03-01|title=The geopolitics of renewable energy: Debunking four emerging myths|journal=Energy Research & Social Science|volume=49|pages=36–40|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018|issn=2214-6296|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is because "predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process".<ref name=":0" /> For example, a forecast that a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more security cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue.

===Performance limits of fluid dynamics equations===
As proposed by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1963, long range weather forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the [[chaos theory|chaotic nature]] of the [[fluid dynamics]] equations involved.  Extremely small errors in the initial input, such as temperatures and winds, within numerical models double every five days.<ref>{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stormwatcherstur00cox_df1/page/222 222–224]|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-471-38108-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/stormwatcherstur00cox_df1/page/222}}</ref>
