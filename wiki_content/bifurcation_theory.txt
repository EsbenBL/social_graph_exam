'''Bifurcation theory''' is the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] study of changes in the qualitative or [[topological]] structure of a given [[Family of curves|family]], such as the [[integral curve]]s of a family of [[vector field]]s, and the solutions of a family of [[differential equation]]s. Most commonly applied to the [[mathematics|mathematical]] study of [[dynamical systems]], a '''bifurcation''' occurs when a small smooth change made to the parameter values (the bifurcation parameters) of a system causes a sudden 'qualitative' or topological change in its behavior.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=P. |last1=Blanchard |first2=R.

R. |last3=Hall |title=Differential Equations |location=London |publisher=Thompson |year=2006 |pages=96–111 |isbn=978-0-495-01265-8 }}</ref> Bifurcations occur in both continuous systems (described by [[Ordinary differential equation|ODE]]s, [[Delay differential equation|DDE]]s or [[Partial differential equation|PDEs]]) and discrete systems (described by maps). The name "bifurcation" was first introduced by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1885 in the first paper in mathematics showing such a behavior.<ref>Henri Poincaré. "''L'Équilibre d'une masse fluide animée d'un mouvement de rotation''". ''Acta Mathematica'', vol.7, pp. 259-380, Sept 1885.</ref> [[Henri Poincaré]] also later named various types of [[stationary points]] and classified them with motif.

==Bifurcation types==
It is useful to divide bifurcations into two principal classes:
* Local bifurcations, which can be analysed entirely through changes in the local stability properties of [[Equilibrium point|equilibria]], periodic orbits or other invariant sets as parameters cross through critical thresholds; and
* Global bifurcations, which often occur when larger invariant sets of the system 'collide' with each other, or with equilibria of the system. They cannot be detected purely by a stability analysis of the equilibria (fixed points).

===Local bifurcations===
[[File:Chaosorderchaos.png|300px|right|thumb|Period-halving bifurcations (L) leading to order, followed by period doubling bifurcations (R) leading to chaos.]]
A local bifurcation occurs when a parameter change causes the stability of an equilibrium (or fixed point) to change. In continuous systems, this corresponds to the real part of an eigenvalue of an equilibrium passing through zero. In discrete systems (those described by maps rather than ODEs), this corresponds to a fixed point having a [[Floquet multiplier]] with modulus equal to one. In both cases, the equilibrium is ''non-hyperbolic'' at the bifurcation point.
The topological changes in the phase portrait of the system can be confined to arbitrarily small neighbourhoods of the bifurcating fixed points by moving the bifurcation parameter close to the bifurcation point (hence 'local').

More technically, consider the continuous dynamical system described by the ODE
:<math>\dot x=f(x,\lambda)\quad f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n.</math>
A local bifurcation occurs at <math>(x_0,\lambda_0)</math> if the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] matrix
<math> \textrm{d}f_{x_0,\lambda_0}</math>
has an [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue]] with zero real part. If the eigenvalue is equal to zero, the bifurcation is a steady state bifurcation, but if the eigenvalue is non-zero but purely imaginary, this is a [[Hopf bifurcation]].

For discrete dynamical systems, consider the system
:<math>x_{n+1}=f(x_n,\lambda)\,.</math>
Then a local bifurcation occurs at <math>(x_0,\lambda_0)</math> if the matrix
<math> \textrm{d}f_{x_0,\lambda_0}</math>
has an eigenvalue with modulus equal to one. If the eigenvalue is equal to one, the bifurcation is either a saddle-node (often called fold bifurcation in maps), transcritical or pitchfork bifurcation. If the eigenvalue is equal to&nbsp;−1, it is a period-doubling (or flip) bifurcation, and otherwise, it is a Hopf bifurcation.

Examples of local bifurcations include:

* [[Saddle-node bifurcation|Saddle-node]] (fold) bifurcation
* [[Transcritical bifurcation]]
* [[Pitchfork bifurcation]]
* [[Period-doubling bifurcation|Period-doubling]] (flip) bifurcation
* [[Hopf bifurcation]]
* [[Neimark–Sacker bifurcation|Neimark–Sacker]] (secondary Hopf) bifurcation

===Global bifurcations===
[[Image:homoclinic_bif.png|frame|right|A phase portrait before, at, and after a homoclinic bifurcation in 2D. The periodic orbit grows until it collides with the saddle point. At the bifurcation point the period of the periodic orbit has grown to infinity and it has become a [[homoclinic orbit]]. After the bifurcation there is no longer a periodic orbit. '''Left panel''': For small parameter values, there is a [[saddle point]] at the origin and a [[limit cycle]] in the first quadrant. '''Middle panel''': As the bifurcation parameter increases, the limit cycle grows until it exactly intersects the saddle point, yielding an orbit of infinite duration. '''Right panel''': When the bifurcation parameter increases further, the limit cycle disappears completely.]]

Global bifurcations occur when 'larger' invariant sets, such as periodic orbits, collide with equilibria. This causes changes in the topology of the trajectories in the phase space which cannot be confined to a small neighbourhood, as is the case with local bifurcations. In fact, the changes in topology extend out to an arbitrarily large distance (hence 'global').

Examples of global bifurcations include:

*'''Homoclinic bifurcation''' in which a [[limit cycle]] collides with a [[saddle point]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Strogatz |first=Steven H. |date=1994 |title=Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |page=262 |isbn=0-201-54344-3 |author-link=Steven Strogatz}}</ref> Homoclinic bifurcations can occur supercritically or subcritically. The variant above is the "small" or "type I" homoclinic bifurcation. In 2D there is also the "big" or "type II" homoclinic bifurcation in which the homoclinic orbit "traps" the other ends of the unstable and stable manifolds of the saddle. In three or more dimensions, higher codimension bifurcations can occur, producing complicated, possibly [[chaos theory|chaotic]] dynamics.
*'''Heteroclinic bifurcation''' in which a limit cycle collides with two or more saddle points; they involve a [[heteroclinic cycle]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Bifurcation Theory and Methods of Dynamical Systems|last=Luo|first=Dingjun|publisher=World Scientific|year=1997|isbn=981-02-2094-4|page=26}}</ref> Heteroclinic bifurcations are of two types: resonance bifurcations and transverse bifurcations. Both types of bifurcation will result in the change of stability of the heteroclinic cycle. At a resonance bifurcation, the stability of the cycle changes when an algebraic condition on the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the equilibria in the cycle is satisfied. This is usually accompanied by the birth or death of a [[periodic orbit]]. A transverse bifurcation of a heteroclinic cycle is caused when the real part of a transverse eigenvalue of one of the equilibria in the cycle passes through zero. This will also cause a change in stability of the heteroclinic cycle.
* '''Infinite-period bifurcation''' in which a stable node and saddle point simultaneously occur on a limit cycle.<ref>James P. Keener, "Infinite Period Bifurcation and Global Bifurcation Branches", ''SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics'', Vol. 41, No. 1 (August, 1981), pp. 127&ndash;144.</ref> As the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a parameter approaches a certain critical value, the speed of the oscillation slows down and the period approaches infinity. The infinite-period bifurcation occurs at this critical value. Beyond the critical value, the two fixed points emerge continuously from each other on the limit cycle to disrupt the oscillation and form two [[saddle point]]s.
* [[Blue sky catastrophe]] in which a limit cycle collides with a nonhyperbolic cycle.

Global bifurcations can also involve more complicated sets such as chaotic attractors (e.g. [[Crisis (dynamical systems)|crises]]).

==Codimension of a bifurcation==
The [[codimension]] of a bifurcation is the number of parameters which must be varied for the bifurcation to occur. This corresponds to the codimension of the parameter set for which the bifurcation occurs within the full space of parameters. Saddle-node bifurcations and Hopf bifurcations are the only generic local bifurcations which are really codimension-one (the others all having higher codimension). However, transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations are also often thought of as codimension-one, because the normal forms can be written with only one parameter.

An example of a well-studied codimension-two bifurcation is the [[Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation|Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation]].
