== Research on guns ==

===Concealed weapons and crime rate===
In a 1997 article written with David B. Mustard<ref name="LottMust97">John R. Lott Jr. and David B. Mustard, "Crime, Deterrence and Right-To-Carry Concealed Handguns", 26 ''Journal of Legal Studies'' 1 (1997) [http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/41.lott_.final_.pdf working paper PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616105437/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/41.lott_.final_.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }}; [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jls/1997/26/1 journal article PDF] {{subscription required}}.</ref> and Lott's subsequent books ''[[More Guns, Less Crime]]'' and ''[[The Bias Against Guns]]'', Lott argued that allowing adults to carry [[concealed weapon]]s significantly reduces crime in America. In 2004, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) National Research Council (NRC) conducted a review of current research and data on firearms and violent crime, including Lott's work, and concluded "that with the current evidence it is not possible to determine that there is a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates."<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309091241/html/2.html NAS, ''Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review'' (2004)] Executive Summary, Major Conclusions, page 2. Chapter 6 Right-to-Carry Laws, pages 120–151, reviews research by Lott and others on this issue.</ref> The NAS report wrote of Lott's work, "The initial model specification, when extended to new data, does not show evidence that passage of right-to-carry laws reduces crime.

Referring to the research done on the topic, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' wrote in 2003 that "Mr. Lott's research has convinced his peers of at least one point: No scholars now claim that legalizing concealed weapons causes a major increase in crime."<ref name="CHE">{{Cite journal|last=Glenn |first=David |date=May 9, 2003 |title='More Guns, Less Crime' Thesis Rests on a Flawed Statistical Design, Scholars Argue |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |volume=49 |issue=35 |page=A18 |url= http://chronicle.com/weekly/v49/i35/35a01801.htm |access-date=2007-05-27}}</ref> As Lott critics Ian Ayres and John J.

===Defensive gun use===
{{Main|Defensive gun use}}
Lott argues in both ''More Guns, Less Crime'' and ''The Bias Against Guns'' that defensive gun use (DGU) is underreported, noting that in general, only shootings ending in fatalities are discussed in news stories. In ''More Guns, Less Crime'', Lott writes that "[s]ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, and no one is harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police." In May 1998, Lott wrote that "national surveys" suggested that "98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack." Lott cited similar figures in op-eds in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''<ref name="Lott98WSJ">{{cite news|first=John R. |last=Lott Jr. |title=Keep Guns out of Lawyers' Hands |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |page=1 |date=1998-06-23}}</ref> and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name="Lott98LAT">{{cite news|first=John R. |last=Lott Jr. |title=Cities Target Gun Makers in Bogus Lawsuits |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=7 |date=1998-12-01}}</ref>

In 2002, he said that brandishing a weapon was sufficient to stop an attack 95% of the time. Other researchers criticized his methodology. A study in ''Public Opinion Quarterly'' said that his sample size of 1,015 respondents was too small for the study to be accurate and that the majority of similar studies suggest a value between 70 and 80 percent.<ref name="2002studycriticism">{{Cite journal|last=McDowall |first=David |date=Summer 2005 |journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]] |title=John R.

=== Defamation suit ===
On April 10, 2006, John Lott filed suit<ref>[http://www.overlawyered.com/lott_complaint.pdf/Lott%20v%20Levitt.pdf PDF of Lott's complaint v. Levitt]</ref> for [[defamation]] against [[Steven Levitt]] and [[HarperCollins Publishers]] over the book ''[[Freakonomics]]'' and against Levitt over a series of emails to John McCall. In the book ''Freakonomics'', Levitt and coauthor [[Stephen J. Dubner]] claimed that the results of Lott's research in ''More Guns, Less Crime'' had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to economist John McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by several authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of the ''Journal of Law and Economics'' had not been peer reviewed, Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.<ref>{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Michael|date=2006-04-11|title=Best-seller leads scholar to file lawsuit; Defamation allegation targets U. of C. author|page=3|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> A federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in ''Freakonomics'' was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint over the email claims.<ref>"[http://johnrlott.tripod.com/2007/01/judge-castillo-issues-decision-on-lott.html Judge Castillo issues decision on Lott v.

A settlement was reached over the claims made by Levitt in the emails to McCall whereby Levitt did not have to issue a formal apology but rather send a letter of clarification to John McCall that the issue of the ''Journal of Law and Economics'' was peer-reviewed, and that Lott had not improperly influenced the editors.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gajda|first=Amy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctvjghvr3|title=The Trials of Academe|date=2010-02-15|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05386-1|location=Harvard University Press|pages=166–170|doi=10.2307/j.ctvjghvr3}}</ref><ref name="settlement">{{Cite journal|last=Glenn|first=David|date=2007-08-10|title=Dueling Economists Reach Settlement in Defamation Lawsuit|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Dueling-Economists-Reach/6720|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=53|issue=49|page=10}}</ref><ref>"[http://chronicle.com/article/Unusual-Agreement-Means/39297 Unusual Agreement Means Settlement May Be Near in 'Lott v.

Lott has claimed that the review was written by his son and wife.<ref name="wifeandson" /> "I probably shouldn't have done it—I know I shouldn't have done it—but it's hard to think of any big advantage I got except to be able to comment fictitiously," Lott told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2003.<ref name="wifeandson" />

===Safe storage gun laws===
In a 2001 study, Lott and John E. Whitley reported that safe-storage gun laws not only did not reduce juvenile suicides or accidental gun deaths, but that they also increased rates of violent and property crime.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lott Jr.|first1=John R.|last2=Whitley|first2=John E.|title=Safe‐Storage Gun Laws: Accidental Deaths, Suicides, and Crime|url=http://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lott-Whitley-Safe-Storage-Laws.pdf|journal=[[The Journal of Law and Economics]]|date=October 2001|volume=44|issue=S2|pages=659–689|doi=10.1086/338346|citeseerx=10.1.1.180.3066|s2cid=154446568}}</ref> The study was criticized by Webster et al. in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' for using [[Tobit regression]] despite the fact that the data used in the study on youth suicides was "highly skewed and [[heteroskedastic]]", and because the vast majority of crimes that Lott and Whitley claimed increased due to safe-storage laws occurred outside the home.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Daniel W.|title=Association Between Youth-Focused Firearm Laws and Youth Suicides|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]|date=4 August 2004|volume=292|issue=5|pages=594–601|doi=10.1001/jama.292.5.594|pmid=15292085|doi-access=free}}</ref> Webster and Carroll also wrote in ''Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law'' that the Lott and Whitley study's findings with respect to crime were inconsistent with prior research.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD46JBOhMU0C | title=Guns in American Society | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Carter, Gregg Lee | year=2002 | pages=151| isbn=9780313386701 }}</ref>

==Other research==
Lott claims that most of the large recent increases in campaign spending for state and federal offices can be explained by higher government spending.<ref>"[https://ssrn.com/abstract=245336 A Simple Explanation for Why Campaign Expenditures are Increasing: The Government is Getting Bigger]" by John R. Lott Jr., Journal of Law and Economics., October 2000</ref> Lott also supports the conclusion that higher quality judges, measured by their output once they are on the court (e.g., number of citations to their opinions or number of published opinions), take longer to get confirmed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00056.x/full|doi = 10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00056.x|title = The Judicial Confirmation Process: The Difficulty with Being Smart|year = 2005|last1 = Lott|first1 = John R.|journal = Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = 407–447}}</ref>

=== Lost Bush votes in the 2000 presidential election ===
In 2000, Lott argued, using a regression analysis, that George W. Bush lost at least 10,000 votes in Florida after the media incorrectly called the state for Al Gore while voting was still on-going in the more conservative parts of the state.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Henry E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VQK7EGohB4C|title=Rethinking Social Inquiry: Diverse Tools, Shared Standards|last2=Collier|first2=David|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780742511255|language=en}}</ref> Lott's argument is used in the influential social science methodology textbook ''Rethinking Social Inquiry'' (edited by Henry Brady and David Collier) as an example of poor methodology. Contrary to Lott's study, they show that the number of lost Bush votes ranged from 28 to 56.<ref name=":1" />

=== Abortion and crime ===
With John Whitley at the University of Adelaide, Lott published a study that argued that liberalization of abortion laws led to higher murder rates.<ref>John R. Lott Jr. and John E. Whitley, "Abortion and Crime: Unwanted Children and Out-of-Wedlock Births", (2001) [https://ssrn.com/abstract=270126 SSRN Yale Law & Economics Research Paper No. 254] working paper and [https://ssrn.com/abstract=969508 Economic Inquiry, Vol. 45, No. 2, pp. 304–324, April 2007] published article.</ref> In a review of the literature on the relationship between abortion and crime, [[Theodore Joyce]], an economist at Baruch College and the National Bureau of Economic Research, praised Lott and Whitley for gathering additional data on abortion but criticized the methodology that they used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Joyce|first=Theodore J.|date=June 2009|title=Abortion and Crime: A Review|doi=10.3386/w15098|s2cid=74738947|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w15098}}</ref>

=== Illegal immigration and crime ===
Lott has non-peer-reviewed research that purports to show that undocumented immigrants are more crime-prone than U.S. citizens. In doing so, Lott lumped together both legal and illegal immigrants in prison into a category for illegal immigrants, leading to an elevated crime rate for illegal immigrants.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Lind|first=Dara|date=2018-03-01|title=The right-wing effort to paint DREAMers as a nightmare|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/1/17054546/immigration-crime-dreamers-daca-gangs|access-date=2021-01-04|website=Vox|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-02-05|title=The Fatal Flaw in John R.

Lott says the overall thrust of his study still holds, but the issue muddles his research and invites guesswork as to the actual crime rate for the undocumented immigrant population in Arizona."<ref>{{Cite news|date=2018|title=Questions raised about study that links undocumented immigrants to higher crime|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/03/21/questions-raised-about-a-study-that-links-undocumented-immigrants-to-higher-crime/?noredirect=on}}</ref>

Lott's claims were heavily promoted by the Trump administration to justify its anti-immigration policies, in particular their attempts to end DACA.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Exstrum|first=Olivia|title=The guy behind the bogus immigration report has a long history of terrible and misleading research|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/02/the-guy-behind-the-bogus-immigration-report-has-a-long-history-of-terrible-and-misleading-research/|access-date=2021-01-04|website=Mother Jones|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Women's suffrage and government growth ===
According to a study by Lott and Larry Kenny, "women's suffrage coincided with immediate increases in state government expenditures and revenue and more liberal voting patterns for federal representatives, and these effects continued growing over time as more women took advantage of the franchise."<ref>"[https://ssrn.com/abstract=160530 How Dramatically Did Women's Suffrage Change the Size and Scope of Government?]" by John R. Lott Jr. and Larry Kenny, Journal of Political Economy, 1999</ref>

=== Affirmative action in police departments ===
Lott published a study arguing that affirmative action in hiring of police reduced the overall quality of all officers and increased crime. The most adverse effects of these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated cities. There is no consistent evidence that crime rates rise when standards for hiring women are changed.<ref>"[https://ssrn.com/abstract=231100 Does a Helping Hand Put Others At Risk?: Affirmative Action, Police Departments, and Crime]" by John R. Lott Jr. Economic Inquiry, April 2000</ref>

=== Environmental regulations ===
Together with John Karpoff and Eric Wehrly at the University of Washington, Lott has worked to show the importance of government regulations through both legal and regulatory penalties and the weaknesses of reputational penalties in reducing [[pollution]].<ref>"[https://ssrn.com/abstract=747824 The Reputational Penalties for Environmental Violations: Empirical Evidence]" by Jonathan M. Karpoff, John R. Lott Jr., Eric Wehrly, Journal of Law and Economics</ref> Firms violating environmental laws suffer statistically significant losses in the market value of firm equity. The losses are of similar magnitudes to the legal penalties imposed; and in the cross section, the market value loss is related to the size of the legal penalty.

=== Voter fraud claims ===
{{further|Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election}}
Lott has claimed there was voter fraud in the 2020 election.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|title=Controversial gun advocate hired by Justice Department last month|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/24/controversial-gun-advocate-justice-department-440251|access-date=2021-01-02|website=POLITICO|language=en}}</ref> He argued there was "irregularities" in the [[absentee ballots]] in [[Missoula County, Montana|Missoula County]], and later wrote a paper claiming there was evidence of fraud in the absentee ballots in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Hansen|first=Jordan|title=GOP-backed group claims 'irregularities' on Missoula County 2020 ballots|url=https://missoulian.com/news/local/gop-backed-group-claims-irregularities-on-missoula-county-2020-ballots/article_c43cc57c-ff31-54c3-9359-4a5d042cb799.html|access-date=2021-09-14|website=missoulian.com|language=en}}</ref> A 2021 ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]'' study by political scientists at Stanford University and the University of Chicago rebutted Lott's paper as being not even remotely convincing, writing that his analysis was "entirely dependent on the completely arbitrary order in which pairs of precincts in other counties are entered in the dataset" and that his conclusions about voter fraud were "utterly baseless."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eggers|first=Andrew C.|last2=Garro|first2=Haritz|last3=Grimmer|first3=Justin|date=2021-11-09|title=No evidence for systematic voter fraud: A guide to statistical claims about the 2020 election|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/118/45/e2103619118|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=118|issue=45|doi=10.1073/pnas.2103619118|issn=0027-8424|pmid=34728563}}</ref><ref name=":6"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Grimmer |first1=Justin |title=Comment On "A Simple Test For The Extent Of Voter Fraud With Absentee Ballots In The 2020 Presidential Election" |url=https://www.hoover.org/research/comment-simple-test-extent-voterfraud-absentee-ballots-2020-presidentialelection |website=[[Hoover Institution]] |access-date=14 September 2021 |date=5 January 2021}}</ref> 

==Trump administration==
In October 2020, Lott was appointed as a senior adviser for research and statistics at the [[Office of Justice Programs]] within the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] (DoJ).<ref name=":2">{{cite web | last1=Gerstein | first1=Josh | title=Controversial gun advocate hired by Justice Department last month | url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/24/controversial-gun-advocate-justice-department-440251 | date=November 24, 2020 | work=[[Politico]] | access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref> Lott resigned from the DoJ on January 16, 2021.<ref>{{cite news |title=John Lott, Discredited Gun Researcher, Leaves DOJ |url=https://www.thetrace.org/2021/01/discredited-gun-researcher-out-at-justice-department/?fbclid=IwAR1t24fYWiqMnYydbZqD4cbzMr-jHyuqx_qetFgGW8mUXBB1LRQER0GGXJc |access-date=January 22, 2021 |work=The Trace |date=21 January 2021 |language=en-us}}</ref>

==2021 "graduation address" event==
On June 4, 2021, two parents of a child killed in the 2018 shooting at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] misled Lott and [[David Keene]] into believing they were to give a dress rehearsal for a 2021 graduation address for a fictitious school called, "the James Madison Academy". The space for the audience was made up of 3,044 empty folding chairs which were meant to represent victims of school shootings. According to BuzzFeedNews, Lott claims he was instructed "...they insisted that I had to have half the talk...be on background checks in particular", while Lott says this was his first commencement address, he went on to assert, "So I said well okay if that's really what you want I can do that but it seemed a little bit weird for a commencement address."<ref name=Clark1>{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Lauren |title=Gun activists tricked into speaking at fake Las Vegas high school graduation |url=https://news3lv.com/amp/news/local/gun-activists-tricked-into-speaking-at-fake-las-vegas-high-school-graduation |website=3LV News |publisher=3LV News |access-date=8 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/nra-president-graduation-speech|title = A Parkland Victim's Dad Tricked a Former NRA President into Speaking at a Fake Graduation}}</ref>

Lott discovered that the event was a staged attempt to call attention to school shootings, and not a genuine commencement address dress rehearsal when the parents orchestrating the faux event posted segments of video that was filmed of the "dress rehearsal" to the internet. Lott says, "I gave a 15-min address, what they put online is about one minute of that 15-minute address, and it kind of chops up and takes out of context numerous points I was making," he said. "So it's quite disturbing, in that sense." Lott then went on to say in an interview local [[Las Vegas]] news that he is not opposed to all forms of background checks, but simply that he believes that background checks made broadly discriminate against persons of color, primarily black and hispanic potential gun buyers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Lauren |title=Gun activists tricked into speaking at fake Las Vegas high school graduation |url=https://news3lv.com/amp/news/local/gun-activists-tricked-into-speaking-at-fake-las-vegas-high-school-graduation |website=3LV News |publisher=3LV News |access-date=12 September 2021}}</ref>
