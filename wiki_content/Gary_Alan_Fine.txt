== Academic focus ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:whispersonthecolor.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Whispers on the Color Line'' by Gary Alan Fine and [[Patricia Turner]]]] -->
Fine has written ethnographies of a number of diverse small group activities from analyses of [[Dungeons and Dragons]] players and [[Mushroom hunting|mushroom hunters]] to high school [[policy debate]]rs and restaurant workers. Fine maintains that these different groups and distinct areas connect: {{cquote|My central research and writing focus is on the relationship between [[culture]] and social culture. This interest informs all of my writing from my study of [[Little League]] baseball to that of [[rumor]] to that of fantasy games. The question I ask is how is [[expressive culture]] shaped by the [[social system]] in which we all live and how does this social system affect the culture that we create and that we participate in. I examine the way in which small groups affect and give meaning to our shared experiences.

His work on [[rumor]] has made a substantial contribution to the understanding of [[urban legends]] and the transmission of rumors. In 2001, he co-authored a book with [[University of California-Davis]] Professor [[Patricia Turner]] on [[Rumor in African American culture|rumors in the African-American community]] and rumors and [[urban legends]] held by whites about blacks in the [[United States]]. He is currently researching rumors related to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] and [[terrorism]]. A recently published manuscript deals with the social production and communication of [[science|scientific]] work at the [[National Weather Service]].

Another area of research includes the complicated historical and social reputations of figures such as [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Fatty Arbuckle]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Warren Harding]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], and [[Henry Ford]]. On August 4, 2004, several months before the [[2004 United States Presidential Election|2004 Presidential Election]], he set off a minor storm, especially in the political [[blogosphere|blogger community]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} with his [[Op-Ed]] piece in the [[Washington Post]] "Ire to the Chief" that argued that the commonly expressed hatreds of Presidents [[George W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Richard Nixon]] reflected their behavior and activities in youth more than their specific policies as President.<ref>Fine, Gary Alan (2004-08-06).  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44160-2004Aug5.html "Ire to the Chief."]  ''Washington Post'', p. A19.</ref>

Fine is also a major figure in the study of the work of [[Erving Goffman]] and the theory of [[symbolic interactionism]]. He co-edited with [[Gregory W. H. Smith]] a major compilation of Goffman's work and of criticism and analysis of his contribution to the social sciences. Together with [[Kent Sandstrom]] and [[Daniel D. Martin|Dan Martin]], he has produced a forthcoming textbook on symbolic interactionism entitled ''Symbols, Selves, and Social Reality: A Symbolic Interactionist Approach to Sociology and Social Psychology''.

== Specific areas ==

=== Restaurants ===

In addition to his analysis of restaurant establishment culture in his 1996 book ''Kitchens: The Culture of Restaurant Work'', Fine considers himself a sort of amateur [[restaurant critic]]. Through 2015, he maintained a blog, called ''Veal Cheeks'',<ref>Fine, Gary Alan.  [http://vealcheeks.blogspot.com/ ''Veal Cheeks''.]  VealCheeks.Blogspot.com.  Retrieved 2018-03-16.</ref> describing his restaurant visits while living in New York City. His writing style, punchy and wry, can also be seen in his review of [[Eric Schlosser]]'s book, ''[[Fast Food Nation]]'', for [[Reason (magazine)|Reason magazine]].<ref>Fine, Gary Alan (2001).  [http://reason.com/0111/cr.gf.chewing.shtml "Chewing the Fat."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929200605/http://reason.com/0111/cr.gf.chewing.shtml |date=2005-09-29 }}  ''Reason'', Nov. 2001.</ref>

=== Art ===

Another subject in which Fine has combined his personal and academic interests is [[art]]. While researching his book about [[outsider art]] ''Everyday Genius'', he became well-acquainted with many of the major figures and artists in that segment of the art world. He studied the cases of major outsider (self-taught) artists like [[Henry Darger]], [[Bill Traylor]], [[Edgar Tolson]], [[Thornton Dial]], [[Lonnie Holley]], [[Martin Ramirez]], [[Sam Doyle]], and [[Howard Finster]]. He is also an avid collector of outsider art himself. While researching the book and living in Georgia, he was a member of the [[Nexus Center for Contemporary Art]] and a board member at the [[High Museum of Art]] in [[Atlanta]]. He is also currently a board member of the [[Intuit (art center)|Intuit: Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art]] in [[Chicago]].

=== Policy Debate ===
During his research for ''Gifted Tongues: High School Debate and Adolescent Culture'', he followed and observed several high school [[Policy Debate|policy debate]] teams in [[Minnesota]]. The book depicts an activity, although popular in United States, that is often seen as esoteric and confusing. His son, Todd David Fine, as described in the dedication to the book, first saw a video of the activity as a young child while Fine was researching the book. Apparently inspired, in high school, Todd, along with his partners Adam Goldstein and Julie Bashkin, went on to capture the national-circuit debate championship the ''[[Tournament of Champions (debate)|Tournament of Champions]]'' and the ''[[Barkley Forum]]'' at [[Emory University]], another major championship in the activity.
