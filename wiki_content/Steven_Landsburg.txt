==Writings and work==

===Commentary and opinions===
Landsburg wrote a [[Column (newspaper)|column]] on "everyday economics" for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine from 1996 to 2008.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/authors.steven_e_landsburg.html Articles By Steven E. Landsburg]</ref> The subjects of the columns were diverse and often drew on current affairs. In them, Landsburg discussed the [[United States public debt|national debt]], the [[obesity]] [[crisis]], payments to [[Hurricane Katrina]] evacuees in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and [[salary cap]]s in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Landsburg also discussed recent research in micro-economics and its implications, as in an article on the value of [[Mobile phones and driving safety|mobile phones and driving]], the (career) cost of [[motherhood]], and whether or not daughters (as opposed to sons) cause [[divorce]].

Landsburg also addressed legal issues: in a ''Slate'' column from 2003, he proposed punishing jurors when a jury's decision is later "proven" to be wrong, such as when an acquitted defendant later admits to committing the crime. If a jury's judgment is later "proven" to be right, Landsburg suggested the jurors should be financially rewarded.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2083034/ Should we punish juries that get it wrong?]</ref>

Landsburg has been particularly critical of mainstream [[environmentalism]], having devoted both ''Slate'' columns and book chapters (in ''[[The Armchair Economist]]'') to criticize environmentalist principles. As a self-described "hardcore [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]", Landsburg emphasizes the importance of individual choice.<ref>[http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2007_04_22-2007_04_28.shtml#1177382131 The Volokh Conspiracy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This position extends to [[health care]], and his view that those who choose no insurance should not receive potentially life-saving treatment.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2133518/ Do the poor deserve life support? – By Steven E. Landsburg – ''Slate Magazine''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This position was asserted partly as a response to [http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/12/14/151930/63 an article] published by [[Daily Kos]].

Landsburg supports [[free trade]] and opposes [[protectionism]], and his writings in the topic have appeared in various newspapers and magazines, including ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/opinion/16landsburg.html What to Expect When You’re Free Trading – New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Landsburg's comparison of [[protectionism]] to [[racism]] in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/0328/046.html Xenophobia and Politics – Forbes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> prompted a response from [[Pat Buchanan]].<ref>[http://www.amconmag.com/2005_04_11/buchanan.html Is Protectionism Racism?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On April 8, 2005, Landsburg debated [[protectionism]] and [[free trade]] with [[John Gibson (media host)|John Gibson]] on the [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[The Big Story (2000 TV series)|The Big Story]]''.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,153081,00.html FOXNews.com – Is Buying American Racist? – John Gibson | Judge Napolitano | John Gibson | Big Story Weekend<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Before the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] Landsburg stated that he planned to vote against [[John Kerry]] because of his belief that [[John Edwards]], Kerry's [[running mate]], was a "[[Xenophobia|xenophobe]]" due to his opposition to free trade. He compared Edwards' views to [[David Duke]]'s [[racism]].<ref>[http://slate.com/id/2108714/ ''Slate'' votes. – ''Slate Magazine''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

He has also reviewed popular economics books '' [[Freakonomics]]''<ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006550 The Wall Street Journal Online – Leisure & Arts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and ''[[The Undercover Economist]]''<ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110007555 The Wall Street Journal Online – Leisure & Arts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]].''

Landsburg has spoken at many distinguished events and in February 2012 he spoke at Warwick Economics Summit and the [[Adam Smith Institute]] in the United Kingdom.

In March 2012, Landsburg supported some of pop radio personality [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s attacks against a Georgetown University student, [[Sandra Fluke]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebigquestions.com/2012/03/02/rush-to-judgment/|title = Rush to Judgment|date = 2 March 2012}}</ref> Fluke spoke before Congress advocating mandating birth control coverage in some insurance programs, citing their use in preventing ovarian cysts. "There are really good arguments for subsidizing and bad arguments for subsidizing [birth control]," Landsburg said during an interview with [[WHAM-TV]]. "However, [Fluke] didn't bother to make any. She made no argument. She simply said she wanted it subsidized."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.13wham.com/news/local/story/Local-Professor-Backs-Controversial-Limbaugh/2mnZkNH2g0Kvi8WXecW6Rw.cspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719005607/http://www.13wham.com/news/local/story/Local-Professor-Backs-Controversial-Limbaugh/2mnZkNH2g0Kvi8WXecW6Rw.cspx |archive-date=2012-07-19 }}</ref> On his blog, Landsburg discussed Limbaugh's calling Fluke a "[[slut]]", and said "A far better word might have been 'prostitute' (or a five-letter synonym therefor), but that's still wrong because Ms. Fluke is not in fact demanding to be paid for sex...The right word for that is something much closer to 'extortionist'."<ref>[http://www.thebigquestions.com/2012/03/02/rush-to-judgment/  "Rush to Judgment", 2 Mar 2012]</ref> Landsburg's comments drew a rebuke from University of Rochester President [[Joel Seligman]], who said he was "outraged that any professor would demean a student in this fashion", and a silent protest from thirty UR students who formed a line between him and his students during one of his classes.<ref>http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20120307/NEWS01/303070022/University-of-Rochester-Rush-Limbaugh-Steven-Landsburg</ref>

In a blog post from March 20, 2013 titled "Censorship, Environmentalism and Steubenville," Landsburg spawned controversy when discussing principles on which to justify what is legal. He proposed as a second attempt that "You can do anything you want as long as you're not causing anybody direct physical harm"; he proceeds to conduct an argument by demonstrating that "it would also allow you to rape an unconscious victim if there were no physical consequences". This outcome, in obvious violation of common sense, is then evidence against the second principle. Critics claim this is an attempt to justify rape on an economic basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebigquestions.com/2013/03/20/censorship-environmentalism-and-steubenville/|title=Censorship, Environmentalism and Steubenville|date=20 March 2013}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2021}}

Many students and faculty at the University of Rochester claimed that Landsburg's "thought experiment" was offensive and potentially dangerous, in that it called into question whether or not the rape of unconscious individuals should be illegal. Some protesters pointed out that the young men charged in the Steubenville rape case (to which Landsburg's post directly refers) claimed not to have known that it was illegal to have sex with an unconscious, non-consenting partner—an ignorance that, according to protesters, Landsburg's thought experiment was helping to perpetuate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/steubenville-rape-trial-these-kids-didnt-know-what-they-were-seeing-was-rape-says-advocate/|title = Steubenville Rape Trial: "These kids didn't know what they were seeing was rape," says advocate}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2021}}

A petition calling on the University to censure Landsburg received several hundred signatures; this petition, along with a student-led protest outside Landsburg's classroom, attracted national media attention.<ref>https://huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/04/university-of-rochester-steven-landsburg_n_3014429.html</ref><ref>http://chronicle.com/article/Professors-Rhetorical/138357/</ref> In response, Landsburg issued an apology in which he said that he had assumed all of his regular blog readers would know that he found rape repugnant, and that the point of the post was to illustrate the paradoxes that arise when trying to prove such obvious conclusions from first principles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/05/new-york-professor-apologizes-for-hypothetical-questions-about-rape/|title=New York professor apologizes for 'hypothetical' questions about rape|date=25 March 2015}}</ref>
