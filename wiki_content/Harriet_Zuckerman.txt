'''Harriet Anne Zuckerman''' (born July 19, 1937, [[New York City]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[sociologist]] and professor emerita of [[Columbia University]].<ref name="Guggenheim">{{cite book |title=Reports of the President and of the Treasurer |date=1980 |publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Q40AAAAIAAJ&q=Harriet+A.+Zuckerman+(born+July+19,+1937) |access-date=24 May 2021}}</ref> 
Zuckerman specializes in the [[sociology of science]].<ref>Synonyms for the term "[[sociology of science]]" include "science of science" ([http://sci.slis.indiana.edu/ "Science of Science Cyberinfrastructure Portal... at Indiana University"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219224025/http://sci.slis.indiana.edu/ |date=February 19, 2013 }}; [[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science," 1935, reprinted in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', Boston, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1982, pp. 82-95) and the [[back-formation|back-formed]] term "[[logology (sociology)|logology]]" ([[Christopher Kasparek]], "[[Bolesław Prus|Prus]]' ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'':  the Creation of a [[Historical Novel]]", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXIX, no. 1, 1994, note 3, pp. 45-46; [[:pl:Stefan Zamecki|Stefan Zamecki]], ''Komentarze do naukoznawczych poglądów Williama Whewella (1794–1866):  studium historyczno-metodologiczne'' [Commentaries to the Logological Views of [[William Whewell]] (1794–1866):  A Historical-Methodological Study], Warsaw, [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], 2012, {{ISBN|978-83-86062-09-6}}, [English-language] summary, pp. 741-43).  The term "[[logology (sociology)|logology]]" provides convenient grammatical variants not available with the earlier terms:  i.e., "logologist", "to logologize", "logological", "logologically".</ref>
She is known for her work on the social organization of science, scientific elites, the accumulation of advantage, the [[Matthew effect]], and the phenomenon of [[multiple discovery]].

==Work==
Zuckerman's research has focused on the social organization of science and scholarship.  She is the author of the 1977 book, ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', which has been credited with defining the direction of work in the field for the next two decades.<ref name="Gordukalova">{{cite journal |last1=Gordukalova |first1=Galina F. |title='Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States' (Reprint Review) |journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy |date=1997 |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=306–308 |doi=10.1086/629960 |jstor=40039731 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40039731 |access-date=26 May 2021}}</ref>  As a basis for her research, Zuckerman used a database to examine more than 60,000 academics, in a powerful demonstration of the self-reinforcing dynamics of American academic culture. Zuckerman's findings, particularly her "fundamental notion"<ref name="Chang"/> of  "accumulation of advantage", questioned assumptions about  [[creativity]], achievement, eminence, and [[greatness]].<ref name="de Haan">{{cite journal |last1=de Haan |first1=J. |last2=Leeuw |first2=F.

The empirical data Zuckerman analyzed, along with work by [[Robert K. Merton]] and others, documented ways in which women scientists were "systematically disadvantaged in educational attainment, productivity, funding, lab space, and recognition".<ref name="Silbey">{{cite journal |last1=Silbey |first1=Susan S. |title=The Every Day Work of Studying the Law in Everyday Life |journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science |date=2019-10-13 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113326 |url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113326 |access-date=26 May 2021|hdl=1721.1/130420 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>
Zuckerman and others have carried out subsequent work on prizes and other rewards; their impact on productivity, collaboration, and authorship;<ref name="Li">{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Jichao |last2=Yin |first2=Yian |last3=Fortunato |first3=Santo |last4=Wang |first4=Dashun |title=Scientific elite revisited: patterns of productivity, collaboration, authorship and impact |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date=April 2020 |volume=17 |issue=165 |pages=20200135 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2020.0135 |pmid=32316884 |pmc=7211484 |arxiv=2003.12519 }}</ref> and on the effectiveness of interventions whose intention is to support women and members of other underrepresented populations.

''Scientific Elite'' is also a fascinating introduction to the phenomenon of [[multiple discovery]] in the fields of [[science]] and [[technology]].<ref name="Archives"/>  Zuckerman further examined conditions and processes influencing the introduction and adoption of scientific ideas in later work. In 1978, she introduced the idea of "postmature scientific discovery".<ref name="Garfield">{{cite journal |last1=Garfield |first1=Eugene |title=Essays of an Information Scientist: Creativity, Delayed Recognition, and Other Essays |journal=Current Contents |date=January 16, 1989 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=3-10, 16-23 |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v12p018y1989.pdf |access-date=26 May 2021}}</ref> 

{{quote|To qualify as postmature, for it to evoke surprise from the pertinent scientific community that it was not made earlier, it must have three attributes. In retrospect, it must be judged to have been technically achievable at an earlier  time with methods then available. It must be judged to have been understandable, capable of being expressed in terms comprehensible to working scientists at the time, and its implications must have been capable of having been appreciated.--Zuckerman & [[Joshua Lederberg|Lederberg]], 1986.<ref name="Hook">{{cite book |last1=Hook |first1=Ernest B. |title=Prematurity in scientific discovery : on resistance and neglect |date=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=9780520231061 |page=272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgCSC2P1IToC&pg=PA272 |access-date=26 May 2021}}</ref><ref name="Lederberg">{{cite journal |last1=Zuckerman |first1=Harriet |last2=Lederberg |first2=Joshua |title=Postmature scientific discovery? |journal=Nature |date=December 1986 |volume=324 |issue=6098 |pages=629–631 |doi=10.1038/324629a0|pmid=3540684 |bibcode=1986Natur.324..629Z |s2cid=29415953 }}</ref>}}

The sociologist of science [[Robert K. Merton]] later credited Zuckman as a co-author of his work on the [[Matthew effect]], writing '“It is now [1973] belatedly evident to me that I drew upon the interview and other materials of the Zuckerman study to such an extent that, clearly, the paper should have appeared under joint authorship.”<ref name="Merton">{{cite journal |last1=Merton |first1=Robert K. |title=The Matthew Effect in Science, II : Cumulative Advantage and the Symbolism of Intellectual Property |journal=Isis |date=1988 |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=606–623 |doi=10.1086/354848 |s2cid=17167736 |url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthewii.pdf}}</ref> 
The  overlooking of Zuckerman's contribution can be considered an  example of a pattern which she noted, which has been nicknamed the [[Matilda effect]] by science historian [[Margaret Rossiter]].<ref name="Archives"/><ref name="Rossiter">{{cite journal |last1=Rossiter |first1=Margaret W. |title=The <s>Matthew</s> Matilda Effect in Science |journal=Social Studies of Science |date=1993 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=325–341 |doi=10.1177/030631293023002004 |s2cid=145225097 |url=http://garciaproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rossiter-1993_The-Mattew-Matilda-Effect-in-Science.pdf |access-date=May 24, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Knobloch-Westerwick">{{cite journal |last1=Knobloch-Westerwick |first1=Silvia |last2=Glynn |first2=Carroll J. |title=The Matilda Effect—Role Congruity Effects on Scholarly Communication: A Citation Analysis of Communication Research and Journal of Communication Articles |journal=Communication Research |date=February 2013 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=3–26 |doi=10.1177/0093650211418339|s2cid=206437794 }}</ref> Zuckerman married [[Robert K.
