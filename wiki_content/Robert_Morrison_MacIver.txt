'''Robert Morrison MacIver''' {{post-nominals|FRS}} (April 17, 1882 – June 15, 1970) was a sociologist.

==Early life and family==
Robert Morrison MacIver was born in [[Stornoway]], [[Isle of Lewis]], [[Scotland]] on April 17, 1882, to Donald MacIver, a general merchant and [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]] manufacturer, and Christina MacIver (née Morrison). His father was a [[Calvinist]],<ref>{{cite document|last1=Hughes|first1=Everett C.|title=Book Review: As a Tale That Is Told: The Autobiography of R. M. MacIver. R. M.

They had three children: Ian Tennant Morrison, Christina Elizabeth, and Donald Gordon.

==Education==
He received degrees from the [[University of Edinburgh]] (M.A. 1903; D.Ph. 1915), the [[University of Oxford]] (B.A. 1907), and [[Columbia University]] (Litt.E. 1929) and Harvard (1936). In his rather long period of formal education, he had never made any academically supervised study of sociology. His work in that field was distinguished by his acumen, his philosophical understanding, and extensive study of the major pioneering works of [[Durkheim]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl|Levy-Bruhl]], [[Simmel]] and others in the [[British Museum]] Library in [[London]],<ref>Obituary by Mirra Komarovsky, [http://www.asanet.org/about-asa/asa-story/asa-history/past-asa-officers/past-asa-presidents/robert-m-maciver-obituary ''The American Sociologist'', February 1971.]</ref> while resident as a student in Oxford.
