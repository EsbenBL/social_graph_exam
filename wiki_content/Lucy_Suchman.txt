'''Lucy Suchman''' is a Professor of Anthropology of Science and Technology in the Department of Sociology at [[Lancaster University]], in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Adelson 2003 290">{{cite journal|last=Adelson|first=Beth|title=Bringing considerations of situated action to bear on the paradigm of cognitive modeling: the 2002 Benjamin Franklin Medal in computer and cognitive science presented to Lucy Suchman|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|year=2003|volume=340|issue=3–4|pages=290|doi=10.1016/s0016-0032(03)00046-2}}</ref> Her current research extends her longstanding critical engagement with the field of human-computer interaction to the domain of contemporary war fighting, including problems of ‘situational awareness’ in military training and simulation, and in the design and deployment of automated weapon systems.  At the center of this research is the question of whose bodies are incorporated into military systems, how and with what consequences for social justice and the possibility for a less violent world.<ref name="Suchman" /> Suchman is a member of [[International Committee for Robot Arms Control]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrac.net/members/lucy-suchman/|title=Lucy Suchman|date=2013-07-03|website=ICRAC|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> and the author of the blog dedicated to the problems of ethical robotics and 'technocultures of humanlike machines'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://robotfutures.wordpress.com/author/suchman/|title=Lucy Suchman|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|website=Robot Futures|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> Before coming to Lancaster, she worked for 22 years at Xerox's [[Xerox PARC|Palo Alto Research Center]], where she held the positions of Principal Scientist and Manager of the Work Practice and Technology research group.<ref name="Adelson 2003 290"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Agencies at the Interface: Colloquium with Lucy Suchman |url=http://www.media.mit.edu/events/2009/05/11/agencies-interface-colloquium-lucy-suchman |work=MIT Media Lab |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |access-date=25 November 2012}}</ref> Suchman is a graduate of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], obtaining her BA in 1972, MA in 1977, and Doctorate in Social and Cultural [[Anthropology]] in 1984.<ref name="Suchman" />  While at Berkeley, she wrote her dissertation on the work practices of accountants.  She studied procedural office work to understand how it was similar to and different from a program, assumptions around the work, and how the work informed the design of these systems.

==Research==
Suchman's early research was heavily influenced by [[ethnomethodology]], a subfield of sociology that argued that people create meaningful action by improvising based on their social and environmental resources.  Suchman's book, ''Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-machine Communication'' (1987), provided intellectual foundations for the field of [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction (HCI)]].   She challenged common assumptions behind the design of [[interactivity|interactive systems]] with a cogent anthropological argument that human action is constantly constructed and reconstructed from dynamic interactions with the material and social worlds. The theory of [[situated cognition]] emphasises the importance of the environment as an integral part of the [[cognitive process]].
She has made fundamental contributions to ethnographic analysis, conversational analysis and Participatory Design techniques for the development of interactive computer systems.<ref name="Suchman" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|title=Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-machine Communication|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=203}}</ref>

An updated version of the book was published in 2007.  This second edition, called ''Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situated Action'', included five new chapters exploring developments in the field of computing and social studies technology since the mid-1980s.<ref name="Suchman" /> Specifically, Suchman addressed the relationship and interactions between humans and machines with a focus on the idea of human-like machines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|title=Human-machine reconfigurations : plans and situated actions|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=314}}</ref> Her later research is dedicated to problems of autonomy and control in human-technology interaction with emphasis on autonomous weapon systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/situational-awareness-and-adherence-to-the-principle-of-distinction-as-a-necessary-condition-for-lawful-autonomy(5ecc7a0e-65ed-4395-b4c3-f82867616d50)/export.html|title=Situational awareness and adherence to the principle of distinction as a necessary condition for lawful autonomy - Research Portal {{!}} Lancaster University|website=www.research.lancs.ac.uk|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>
