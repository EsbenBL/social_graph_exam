Hanushek advocates using economic analysis to improve student performance. He has authored numerous, highly cited<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=hanushek&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C29&as_sdtp=  Google scholar for Eric Hanushek]</ref> articles on the effects of [[class-size reduction|class size reduction]], [[No Child Left Behind Act|high-stakes accountability]], teacher effectiveness, and other education related topics.   In a 1971 paper he introduced the concept of evaluating teacher effectiveness on the basis of student learning gains.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "Teacher characteristics and gains in student achievement: Estimation using micro data." ''American Economic Review'' 60, no. 2 (May 1971): 280–88.  See the history in Elizabeth Green, ''Building a better teacher:  How teaching works (and how to teach it to everyone)'' (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2014).</ref> This idea is the basis of [[value-added modeling|value-added assessments]] of teacher quality. In his most recent book, ''The Knowledge Capital of Nations'', Hanushek concludes that the quality of education is causally related to [[economic growth]].

Hanushek is a frequent contributor to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal and also appears frequently in court cases as a paid expert witness testifying for the state in lawsuits brought by plaintiffs attempting to equalize disparities in funding of school districts.<ref>Reporter Kevin Carey, interviewing Hanushek in 2006 stated: "You mentioned school funding lawsuits. You've served as an expert witness in a number of those lawsuits, always working for states defending themselves against charges that their school funding systems unfairly short-change some school districts." To which Hanushek replied: "I have. I've been involved in those cases over a long period of time. I have always testified on the defense side [i.e., against funding equity]." See [http://www.educationsector.org/publications/money-matters  Kevin Carey, "Money Matters: An interview with Eric Hanushek"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908075220/http://www.educationsector.org/publications/money-matters |date=2013-09-08 }}, ''EducationSector at the American Institutes For Research'', April 26, 2006.

==Activities,  appointments, and awards==
Hanushek received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1965 and a [[PhD]] in [[economics]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1968. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1961 to 1974. Hanushek held teaching positions at the [[U.S. Air Force Academy]] (1968–73) and at [[Yale University]] (1975–78) and was named professor of economics and public policy at the [[University of Rochester]] from 1978 to 2000.

Hanushek is a member of the Hoover Institution's [[Koret Task Force]] on K-12 Education, whose members, including [[Caroline M. Hoxby]] and [[Paul E. Peterson]], support school accountability, teacher incentives, and charter schools and vouchers. Hanushek was a presidential appointee to the Board of Directors of the National Board for Education Sciences that approves the research priorities of the U.S. Department of Education's [[Institute of Education Sciences]] and was the Board chair from 2008 to 2010. From 2011 to 2013, he served on the Equity and Excellence Commission of the U.S. Department of Education. He is a research professor at the [[Ifo Institute for Economic Research]] (University of Munich) and is the area coordinator for Economics of Education, CESifo Research Network.  He is also a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a research fellow of the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA).  In the U.S. federal government, Hanushek has served as deputy director of the [[Congressional Budget Office]], senior staff economist at the [[Council of Economic Advisers]], and senior economist for the Cost of Living Council.  At the state level, he has been appointed to state education advisory commissions by the governor of California and of Texas.

Hanushek was the recipient of an award for scholarship from the [[Thomas B. Fordham Institute#Awards|Thomas B. Fordham Institute]] (a think tank) in 2004.

==Personal life==
Hanushek is married to Margaret (Macke) Raymond, director of the Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) at Stanford University. CREDO has issued numerous studies of the performance of [[charter school]]s in the United States.

==As expert witness==
Since the early 1970s, when plaintiffs have filed lawsuits seeking to overthrow school funding based on local property taxes as inequitable, Hanushek has been called to testify as an expert witness in defense of the state. He testifies that the problem with schools is not so much lack of funds as inefficiency and asserts that increasing (or seeking to equalize) appropriations can be wasteful, since his analyses show that more funding produces inconsistent outcomes.<ref>[http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/01/17/expert-says-money-doesnt-make-better-schools/  Kate Alexander, "School Finance Trial: Expert: More money might not fix Texas schools", ''Austin American Statesman'', January 1, 2013].</ref> Instead of seeking to equalize funding among districts, Hanushek recommends introducing value-added testing to identify and remove underperforming teachers, greater accountability, and vouchers and charter schools to introduce market-based parental choice. He labels those who oppose these measures as wanting to protect special interests and sacred cows and accuses them of wanting to maintain the status quo. In particular, Hanushek identifies teachers' unions among the entrenched or special interests that oppose the measures he recommends.<ref>See Eric Hanushek and Alfred Lindseth, ''Schoolhouses, Courthouses, and Statehouses: Solving the Funding-Achievement Puzzle in America's Public Schools'' (Princeton University Press, 2009), p. 270 and passim.</ref> The 20 school funding trials at which Hanushek has testified over the years include ''[[Serrano v. Priest]]'' (1973) in California, ''Somerset County Board of Education v Hornbeck'' in Maryland (1980), and ''[[Abbott v. Burke]]'' (1987) in New Jersey. His ''amicus'' brief was cited in the 2009 five-to-four U.S. Supreme Court decision of ''[[Horne v. Flores]]''. Citing Hanushek and Lindseth in a majority opinion written by Justice [[Samuel Alito]], the court held that in evaluating the actions of the state, attention should focus on student outcomes rather than on inequalities of spending and other inputs to schools.

In 2011 Hanushek was the central expert witness for the defense in the highly publicized case of Lobato vs. State of Colorado, named for Taylor Lobato, who in 2005 was a middle-school student when her parents filed a suit that claimed her San Luis Valley school district was underfunded compared to wealthier districts. In that case, Denver District Judge Sheila Rappaport issued a 189-page decision rejecting the state's arguments, writing that: "Dr. Hanushek’s analysis that there is not much relationship in Colorado between spending and achievement contradicts testimony and documentary evidence from dozens of well-respected educators in the State, defies logic, and is statistically flawed."<ref>Todd Engdahl, [http://www.ednewscolorado.org/news/ruling-a-clean-sweep-for-lobato-plaintiffs "Ruling a clean sweep for Lobato Plaintiffs"], ''[[EdNews Colorado]]'', December 12, 2011. See also:
[http://www.denverpost.com/ci_19520710 Tim Hoover, "Denver judge's ruling on school funding levels blisters state's witnesses", ''Denver Post, December 1, 2011.]</ref> In 2013, the Colorado Supreme Court reversed Judge Rappaport's opinion and overturned the lower court's opinion in its entirety.

For his part, Hanushek maintains that state and federal court decisions "of the type we describe" (namely, rejecting funding equity appeals) may be justified because they "may persuade the legislature to adopt the more ‘disruptive’ reforms that may actually lead to improvements in student achievement."<ref>Hanushek and Lindseth, "Schoolhouses, Courthouses, and Statehouses'' (2009) p. 287.</ref>

==Research==
Hanushek's Ph.D. thesis introduced a model that he termed an "educational production function" into the analysis of education issues.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, ''The Education of Negroes and Whites,'' PhD. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1968; see also the expanded version, Eric A. Hanushek, ''Education and Race: An Analysis of the Educational Production Process'' (Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath, 1972).</ref> This model postulated a clear distinction between inputs to education – including family, neighborhood, and peer factors – and outcomes of education – typically measured by student achievement, continuation in school, or ultimately income and employment.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "Conceptual and empirical issues in the estimation of educational production functions," ''Journal of Human Resources'' 14(3), Summer 1979: 351–88.</ref> According to Hanushek, when placed in the common [[value-added modeling|value-added]] form, his model identifies the impact of added resources, given prior achievement and other non-school factors.

===The relationship between resources and class size and academic performance===
His 1986 paper, "The Economics of Schooling",<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "The economics of schooling," ''Journal of Economic Literature'', 49(3), September 1986. pp. 1141–177</ref> reported finding an inconsistent relationship between school resources and student outcomes. It provoked numerous responses.<ref>See, for example, Gary Burtless (ed.), ''Does money matter? The effect of school resources on student achievement and adult success'' (Washington, DC: Brookings, 1996).</ref> For this reason he is associated, especially by his detractors, with the slogan "money doesn't matter". One critic, [[Larry Hedges]], used [[meta-analysis]] of Hanushek's own figures to contend that $100 spent per pupil (1989 dollars) would in fact ''raise'' student achievement by one-fifth of a standard deviation.<ref>Larry V. Hedges, Richard D. Laine, and Rob Greenwald, "Does money matter? A meta-analysis of studies of the effects of differential school inputs on student outcomes," ''Educational Researcher'' 23(3), April 1994: 5–14. See also: Morton Hunt, "How science takes stock: the story of meta-analysis" 1997, The Russell Sage Foundation, New York</ref> Between 1990 and 2010, however, spending per pupil adjusted for inflation rose by $3500, while reading scores of 17-year-olds actually fell.<ref>U.S. Department of Education, ''Digest of Education Statistics 2012'', Tables 213 and 140</ref> Hanushek responded to critics in "Money might matter somewhere."<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "Money might matter somewhere: A response to Hedges, Laine, and Greenwald," ''Educational Researcher'' 23(4), May 1994: 5–8.</ref> Hanushek maintains that how money is spent is more important than how much money is spent, now a commonly accepted interpretation of the data. He suggests that money allocated ought to be spent implementing the policies with proven efficacy, such as replacing teachers who fail to raise test scores and closing schools which persistently fail to produce reasonable student achievement. Citing with approval [[Frederick M. Hess]] of the [[American Enterprise Institute]], he argues that court decisions over funding adequacy, may create a policy ‘window’ in which "judicial cover is provided for legislative activities and a variety of remedies are put forward. These ‘windows’ have been mainly used to push through higher funding, but there is no reason that court decisions could not also open a ‘window’ during which other reforms, such as those discussed in this book, might also be enacted."<ref>Eric Hanushek and Alfred Lindseth, ''Schoolhouses, Courthouses, and Statehouses: Solving the Funding-Achievement Puzzle in America's Public Schools'' (Princeton University Press, 2009) pp. 285–86.</ref>

Hanushek's other claim, that class size has no consistent effect on educational performance,<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "The failure of input-based schooling policies",  ''Economic Journal'', 113, February 2003, pp. F64–98</ref> is vehemently disputed by [[Alan Krueger]],<ref>Alan B. Krueger, "Understanding the magnitude and effect of class size on student achievement" in ''The Class Size Debate,'' edited by Lawrence Mishel and Richard Rothstein (Washington, DC: Economic Policy Institute, 2002): 7–35; Eric A. Hanushek, "Evidence, politics, and the class size debate" in ''The Class Size Debate,'' edited by Lawrence Mishel and Richard Rothstein (Washington, DC: Economic Policy Institute, 2002): 37–65.</ref> among others. The debate is summed up in Lawrence Mishel and Richard Rothstein (eds.) ''The class size debate'' (Washington, DC: Economic Policy Institute, 2002). See also the peer-reviewed assessment of the evidence in Ronald G. Ehrenberg, Dominic J. Brewer, Adam Gamoran, and J. Douglas Willms, "Class size and student achievement." Psychological Science in the Public Interest 2, no. 1 (May 2001) 1–30

Hanushek explains his position this way:<blockquote>The discussion whether school resources are systematically related to school quality and to school achievement has tended toward a battle of slogans "Money matters" or "Money doesn’t matter." ... It is tautological to say that we will get good performance if we spend the money wisely. Today the existing knowledge base does not ensure that any added funds will, on average, be spent wisely. That is true even if some schools may spend their funds wisely.<ref>Eric Hanushek, "School Resources and School Funding" in Gary T. Burtless, editor, "Effect of School Resources on Student Achievement" (Brookings Institution Press, 1996),pp. 68−69</ref><ref>See also Eric Hanushek and Alfred Lindseth, ''Schoolhouses, Courthouses, and Statehouses'' (Princeton University Press, 2009), p. 57</ref></blockquote> As an alternative to increasing funding for public schools as a way to boost student performance, Hanushek recommends holding schools accountable and assessing teacher effectiveness.

===Effect of teacher and administrator quality on learning gains===
Hanushek concludes that teacher quality is by far the most important factor in raising student achievement and, moreover, that teacher quality is not closely related to such factors as teacher salaries, educational background, or experience. In considering teacher policies, test scores should be one metric by which the quality of teachers should be measured, Hanushek contends.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "Teacher Characteristics and Gains in Student Achievement: Estimation Using Micro-Data," ''American Economic Review'', 61(2), May 1971, pp. 280–88; Eric A. Hanushek, "The Trade-off Between Child Quantity and Quality," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 100(1), February 1992, pp. 84–117; Steven G. Rivkin, Eric A. Hanushek, and John F. Kain, "Teachers, Schools, and Academic Achievement," ''Econometrica'' 73(2), March 2005, pp. 417–58.</ref>

In contrast to James Coleman, who in the 1960s had suggested that schools and teachers had little effect on student performance,<ref>[[James Samuel Coleman|James S. Coleman]] et al., ''Equality of Educational Opportunity'' (Washington, DC, 1966)</ref> Hanushek introduced the idea of judging teacher effectiveness based on the learning gains of students. Hanushek's 1992 study of inner-city children showed that disadvantaged pupils taught by good teachers gained one-and one-half years of learning, as opposed to only six months when taught by poor teachers – that is, a difference of a full school year.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "The Trade-off Between Child Quantity and Quality," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 100 :1 (February 1992): 84–117.</ref> This finding he maintained had highly significant policy implications.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Steven G. Rivkin, "The distribution of teacher quality and implications for policy," ''Annual Review of Economics'' 4 (2012): 7.1–7.27</ref>

Hanushek's approach underlies the development of  "[[value-added modelling|value-added assessment]]" methods of teacher effectiveness, which uses statistical analysis of student achievement information (as measured by pupil scores) to evaluate teacher performance. When applied in teacher personnel decisions, value added assessment has been highly controversial. In 2010, the value added rankings for more than 6,000 teachers were published in the ''Los Angeles Times'', resulting in complaints by teachers and their unions that they were being subjected to [[public humiliation|public shaming]].<ref>Jason Felch, Jason Song, and Doug Smith, "Grading the teachers: Who's teaching L.A.'s kids?" ''Los Angeles Times'', August 14, 2010.</ref> The ''New York Times'' also subsequently published such measures for their local teachers. Nonetheless, a significant number of states now require that teacher evaluations include consideration of student achievement and in some cases require the use of value added measures.<ref>Kathryn M. Doherty and Sandi Jacobs,Connect the Dots: Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, DC: National Council on Teacher Quality (October 2013)</ref>

In a series of papers, Hanushek argued that replacing the least effective 5–8 percent of teachers with an average teacher could lead to dramatic gains in achievement for U.S. students.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek,  "Teacher deselection." In ''Creating a new teaching profession'', edited by Dan Goldhaber and Jane Hannaway. (Washington, DC: Urban Institute Press, 2009: 165–80); Eric A. Hanushek,  "The economic value of higher teacher quality, ''Economics of Education Review '' 30, no. 3 (June 2011): 466–79; and Eric A. Hanushek,  "Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?" ''Education Next'' 11, no. 3 (Summer 2011).</ref>   By his calculations, average U.S. [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] scores would increase to the level of Canada, or maybe even Finland, and that higher U.S. growth would lead to substantial economic gains.  These arguments have led to a continuing and contentious debate.  One side has argued that this analysis supports arguments for improving teacher evaluations and for eliminating teacher tenure.  The other side has argued that it is not possible to fire yourself to the top.

Hanushek's analyses of teacher value-added and of the impact of teacher effectiveness on economic outcomes of students were central to the California court case of [[vergara v california|''Vergara v. California'']], a case in which he subsequently testified for the plaintiffs.   That court case challenged the constitutionality of the teacher tenure and the teacher dismissal statutes in California.  In June 2014 Judge Ralph M. Treu issued his ruling in the case, finding that the statutes in question were unconstitutional.<ref>Jennifer Medina, "Judge Rejects Teacher Tenure for California", ''New York Times'', June 10, 2014.</ref>   This ruling was subsequently appealed by the California Teachers Association and by Governor Jerry Brown.<ref>Adam Nagourney, "California Governor Appeals Court Ruling Overturning Protections for Teachers," ''New York Times'', August 30, 2014.</ref>  A follow-on suit was filed in New York State.<ref>Jessica Levinson, "Teacher Tenure: Taking It to the Courts," ''Huffington Post'', October 22, 2014.</ref>

Princeton University economist Jesse M. Rothstein has described the use of [[value-added modeling|value-added measurement]] for evaluating teacher performance, recommended by Hanushek as early as 1971, as conceptually deeply flawed, since value-added scores assume that students are randomly assigned to teachers, whereas in the real world it is almost never the case for students to be randomly assigned to teachers or schools. "Non-random assignment of students to teachers can bias value-added estimates of teachers’ causal effects," Rothstein writes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gsppi.berkeley.edu/faculty/jrothstein/published/rothstein_vam2.pdf |title=Jessie M. Rothstein, "Student sorting and bias in value-added estimation: Selection on observables and unobservables," Princeton University and NBER (January 11, 2009). |access-date=December 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720224023/http://gsppi.berkeley.edu/faculty/jrothstein/published/rothstein_vam2.pdf |archive-date=July 20, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Daniel F. McCaffrey and Thomas Kane of the Measures of Effective Teaching Project of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had published studies supportive of Hanushek's contentions,<ref>Thomas J.Kane, Daniel F. McCaffrey, Trey Miller, and Douglas O. Staiger, "Have We Identified Effective Teachers? Validating Measures of Effective Teaching Using Random Assignment: MET Project: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation", January 2013.</ref> as have Raj Chetty (William Henry Bloomberg Professor of Economics at Harvard) et al.<ref>Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, and Jonah Rockoff, "Measuring the Impacts of Teachers I: Evaluating Bias in Teacher Value-Added Estimates", ''American Economic Review'', September 2014, and Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, and Jonah Rockoff, "Measuring the Impacts of Teachers II: Teacher value-added and the student outcomes in adulthood", ''American Economic Review'', September 2014.</ref>

In addition to measuring teachers, Hanushek has also applied his outcome-based approach to measuring the effectiveness of school principals, whom he states also greatly impact student achievement – through their role in selecting and retaining good teachers. This research appeared as working paper "Estimating the effects of leaders on public sector productivity. The case of school principals", published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (2012). The same authors also issued a more general article, "School Leaders Matter", explaining their conclusions in the Hoover Institute magazine ''Education Next'' 13: 1 (Winter 2013). In a review, Margaret Terry Orr agreed that principals can have positive effects but she questioned whether value added methods could ever adequately measure their performance, faulting the authors for using "sloppy terminology" and ignoring "a large body of research."<ref>[http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/ttr-ldrsednext-orr_0.pdf Margaret Terry Orr, "Review of Two Articles on Principal Effects", National Education Policy Center (March 2013) NEPC]</ref>

===Effects of peers and school racial composition===
Together with co-authors John Kain and Steven Rivkin, Hanushek has studied the influence of peer ability on achievement in elementary classrooms in Texas, concluding that the achievement level of peers exerts a positive influence whose impact is roughly constant across the achievement distribution.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, John F. Kain, Jacob M. Markman, and Steven G. Rivkin, "Does peer ability affect student achievement?" ''Journal of Applied Econometrics'' 18(5), September/October 2003: 527–44.</ref> In contrast, the variance in achievement appears to have no systematic influence, leading them to conclude that ability grouping per se has no separate impact.

Hanushek et al. also found that achievement levels of black students (but not of white or Hispanic students) appeared to be systematically lowered in the presence of large concentrations of other black students in their school.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, John F. Kain, and Steve G. Rivkin, "New evidence about Brown v. Board of Education: The complex effects of school racial composition on achievement," ''Journal of Labor Economics'' 27(3), July 2009: 349–83.</ref> They found this effect to be especially pronounced among the highest-achieving black students.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Steven G. Rivkin, "Harming the best: How schools affect the black-white achievement gap." ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' 28:3 (Summer 2009): 366–93.</ref> These results, in their view, underscore the importance of school integration.

===Economic impact of education===

[[File:Knowledge capital and economic growth rates in different regions.png|thumb|Average annual growth rate in real GDP per capita vs. scores on standardized tests of student achievement 1960-2000 adjusted for 1960 GDP per capita.  [From Hanushek and Woessmann (2015, Table 1A.1, similar to their Figure 1.1).]]]

Hanushek contends that in both individuals and nations, cognitive skills are causally related to economic outcomes such that variations in growth rates across countries can be largely explained by consideration of the role of cognitive skills.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hanushek |first1=Eric |title=For long-term economic development, only skills matter |url=https://wol.iza.org/articles/for-long-term-economic-development-only-skills-matter |publisher=IZA World of Labor |access-date=2 May 2021}}</ref><ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Dennis Kimko, "Schooling, Labor Force Quality, and the Growth of Nations," ''American Economic Review'', 90(5), December 2000, pp. 1184–208; Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann,"The Role of Cognitive Skills in Economic Development" , ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 46(3), September 2008:pp. 607–68</ref> Previous studies have measured human capital through years of schooling attained by the labor force,<ref>Mark Bils and Peter J. Klenow, "Does schooling cause growth?" ''American Economic Review'' 90(5), December 2000: 1160–183.</ref> Hanushek, however, believes that cognitive skills as measured by international test scores, give a more accurate picture in industrialized and developing countries alike.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann, "Do better schools lead to more growth? Cognitive skills, economic outcomes, and causation," ''Journal of Economic Growth'', 17(4), December 2012: 267–321.</ref>

Breton has challenged the validity of Hanushek's claim that cognitive skills, as measured by international test scores, are a more accurate indicator of a nation's capabilities than years of schooling.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.econedurev.2011.01.005| title = The quality vs. The quantity of schooling: What drives economic growth?| journal = Economics of Education Review| volume = 30| issue = 4| pages = 765–773| year = 2011| last1 = Breton | first1 = T. R. | hdl = 10784/2438| hdl-access = free}}</ref>  He argues that the statistical analysis that Hanushek and [[Ludger Woessmann|Woessmann]] use to support this claim is invalid because their model is mis-specified.

Differences in economic growth among [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries closely reflect differences in mathematics and science achievement.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann, "How much do educational outcomes matter in OECD countries?" ''Economic Policy'' 26(67), July 2011: 427–91.</ref> Differences in achievement also appear to explain completely the slow growth of Latin America.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann, "Schooling, Educational Achievement, and the Latin American Growth Puzzle," ''Journal of Economic Development'' 99(2), November 2012: 497–512.</ref>

At the individual level, differences in cognitive skills across countries receive varying rewards in the labor market. The U.S. appears to reward skills the most, while Poland, Sweden, and the Czech Republic provide the least return among selected countries.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Lei Zhang, "Quality-consistent estimates of international schooling and skill gradients." ''Journal of Human Capital'' 3(2), Summer 2009: 107–43.</ref>

Linking teacher  [[value-added modeling|value-added measurement]] with research on the economic impact of differences in achievement both for individual earnings and for economic growth, Hanushek estimates that the impact of differences in teacher quality is significant, and the least effective teachers in U.S. schools have an especially large impact. He estimates that replacing the least effective 5–8 percent of teachers with an average teacher would increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 75 to 110 trillion dollars in present value.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "[http://educationnext.org/valuing-teachers/ Valuing Teachers]," ''Education Next'', 11(3), Summer 2011.</ref>  He discussed the impact of replacing low performing (bottom 5%) teachers with average teachers in the movie [[Waiting for "Superman"]].

===Accountability===
Hanushek forcefully advocates instituting state and federal accountability systems to improve student achievement,<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Margaret E. Raymond, "Does school accountability lead to improved student performance?" ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' 24(2), Spring 2005: 297–327</ref> even while acknowledging that existing accountability systems have also been shown to introduce some unwanted outcomes.<ref>David Figlio and Susanna Loeb,"School accountability" In ''Handbook of the Economics of Education'', Vol. 3, edited by Eric A. Hanushek, Stephen Machin, and Ludger Woessmann (Amsterdam: North Holland, 2011): 383–421.</ref>

In 2011, a [[United States National Research Council]] panel issued a report that concluded that empirical results do not support the use of such test-based accountability policies such as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] and high school exit exams. The report concluded that such incentives, which now have been in place for many years, at best have succeeded in raising scores only minutely in the earliest grades and then only in math. The panel also reported that high school exit exams serve only to increase the dropout rate and have no effect on scores.<ref>[http://standardizedtests.procon.org/sourcefiles/incentives-and-test-based-accountability-in-education.pdf Michael Hout and Stuart W. Elliott (eds.), ''Incentives and test-based accountability in education'' (Washington, DC: National Academies Press), 2011].</ref> Hanushek responded in the pages of  ''Education Next'' (published by the Hoover Institution), accusing the panel of "bias" and calling its evidence of poor or non-existent educational improvement "weak".<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "Grinding the anti-testing ax: More bias than evidence behind NRC panel's conclusions", ''Education Next'' 12:2 (Spring 2012): 49–55.</ref> Since then arguments about test-based incentives and school exit exams has intensified.<ref>John Robert Warren and Eric Grodsky, "No Axe to Grind: A Response to Hanushek," ''Educational Policy'' 26: 3 (May 2012: 352–59) and Eric A. Hanushek, "A flawed analysis of unrepresentative state achievement data," ''Educational Policy'' 26: 3 (May 2012): 360–68.</ref> The re-authorization of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] and plans for expansion of high school exit examinations now hinge on the outcome of these debates.

===Institutional design===
The operations of schools within are shaped and affected by the structure of each country's schooling, making it difficult to assess the significance of the educational environment. Together with [[Ludger Woessmann]] of the University of Munich and other co-authors, Hanushek has developed comparative data-based approaches for identifying the impact of differing educational systems.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann, "The economics of international differences in educational achievement" in ''Handbook of the Economics of Education'', Vol. 3, edited by Eric A. Hanushek, Stephen Machin, and Ludger Woessmann (Amsterdam: North Holland, 2011): 89–200.</ref>

===Ability tracking and local control===
Hanushek is on record as opposing early ability tracking on the grounds that research shows that early tracking increases educational inequality and can reduce average performance.  Countries that separate students into different tracks early tend to increase the variation in student achievement.<ref>Julian R. Betts, "The Economics of Tracking in Education" in ''Handbook of the Economics of Education'', edited by Stephen Machin Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann (Amsterdam: North Holland, 2011): 341–81. Hanushek and Woessmann identify the impact of systemic tracking by comparing differences in student outcomes between primary and secondary schools across tracked and non-tracked systems. See" Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann, "Does educational tracking affect performance and inequality? Differences-in-differences evidence across countries." ''Economic Journal'' 116( 510), March 2006: C63–76.</ref>

Countries also differ in how much local decision making they permit in their schools. Using a method of their own devising, Hanushek, Woessmann, and Susanne Link used international assessment data from the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], or PISA, to compare changes in student achievement within individual countries to changes in local autonomy over various educational decisions.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, Susanne Link, and Ludger Woessmann, "Does school autonomy make sense everywhere? Panel estimates from PISA." ''Journal of Development Economics'' forthcoming.</ref> They concluded that in developed countries, local decision making impacts positively on student performance. This was also more true where countries had external examinations for students. They caution, however, that it might not be valid to generalize such findings from developed countries to developing countries.  In less developed countries,  particularly where there was no monitoring of schools through external examinations, local decision making was harmful.

Hanushek also looked at the effects of [[vocational education]] versus general education. Some analyses suggest that emphasis of specific skills through vocational schooling can result in slower economic growth,<ref>Dirk Krueger and Krishna B. Kumar, "US-Europe differences in technology-driven growth: quantifying the role of education," ''Journal of Monetary Economics'' 51(1), January 2004: 161–90.</ref> since workers with very specific training, might be able to find work more easily when young but may be disadvantaged later when new technologies make their skills obsolete. Hanushek, Guido Schwerdt, Woessmann, and Lei Zhang compared the life-cycle employment and earnings patterns of those with vocational and general education across countries and found that workers in the most vocation-intensive countries ("apprenticeship countries") did suffer later in their careers and tended to leave the labor force noticeably earlier than workers with general training.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, Guido Schwerdt, Ludger Woessmann, and Lei Zhang, "General Education, Vocational Education, and Labor-Market Outcomes over the Life-Cycle," ''Journal of Human Resources'' 52(1), Winter 2017: 48-87.</ref>

===Education in developing countries===
Development agencies such as the [[World Bank]] and [[UNESCO]] have traditionally emphasized expanding access through such initiatives as [[Education for All]] and the [[Millennium Development Goals]] . Hanushek and Woessmann, however, caution that merely improving access can do little, unless students' cognitive skills are raised, which they say is not happening in many developing countries.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann, ''Education quality and economic growth'' (Washington: World Bank, 2007).</ref> They also linked poor quality schools to high dropout rates.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, Victor Lavy, and Kohtaro Hitomi, "Do students care about school quality? Determinants of dropout behavior in developing countries," ''Journal of Human Capital'' 1(2), Spring 2008: 69–105.</ref>

Hanushek's work for the World Bank showed that in developing countries, as in the U.S., policies intended to improve educational resources have not been consistently productive, even though in developing countries they have noticeably lower levels of inputs.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, "Interpreting recent research on schooling in developing countries," ''World Bank Research Observer'' 10(2), August 1995: 227–46.</ref> In the poorest areas of Brazil, for example, Hanushek and Ralph Harbison contended that large differences among schools and teachers were not systematically related to teacher education, teacher experience, and most other measures of general resources of schools.<ref>Ralph W. Harbison and Eric A. Hanushek, ''Educational performance of the poor: lessons from rural northeast Brazil'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992).</ref> Hanushek has advocated targeted policies, such as providing text books, which can lead to more efficient schooling by cutting down on grade repetition.<ref>João Batista Gomes-Neto and Eric A. Hanushek, "Causes and consequences of grade repetition: Evidence from Brazil," ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 43(1), October 1994: 117–48; Eric A. Hanushek, João Batista Gomes-Neto, and Ralph W. Harbison, "Efficiency-enhancing investments in school quality" in ''Opportunity foregone: Education in Brazil'', edited by Nancy Birdsall and Richard H. Sabot (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 1996): 385–424.</ref>

===The Texas Schools Project===
As chairman of the Executive Committee for the Texas Schools Project at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] (UTD), Hanushek worked with John F. Kain to develop the university's Texas Schools Project.<ref>[http://www.utdallas.edu/research/tsp-erc/ Texas Schools Project]</ref> This project used administrative data from schools to compile databases to permit the analysis of the effects of teacher labor markets<ref>See Eric A. Hanushek, John F. Kain, and Steve G. Rivkin, "Why public schools lose teachers," ''Journal of Human Resources'' 39(2), Spring 2004: 326–54; Eric A. Hanushek and Steven G. Rivkin, "Constrained Job Matching: Does Teacher Job Search Harm Disadvantaged Urban Schools?" NBER w15816 (Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, March2010)</ref> and the impacts of [[special education]],<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, John F. Kain, and Steve G. Rivkin, "Inferring program effects for specialized populations: Does special education raise achievement for students with disabilities?"

Rivkin, "Disruption versus Tiebout improvement: The costs and benefits of switching schools," ''Journal of Public Economics'' 88(9–10), 2004: 1721–746.</ref> and [[charter schools]].<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, John F. Kain, Steve G. Rivkin, and Gregory F. Branch, "Charter school quality and parental decision making with school choice," ''Journal of Public Economics'' 91(5-6), June 2007: 823–48.</ref> The Texas Schools Project was the model for similar administrative databases such as found in Florida, North Carolina, and New York.

* Hanushek's 2013 book, ''Endangering Prosperity: A Global View of the American School'',<ref>Hanushek et al. (2013).</ref> written with Hoover Institute colleague Paul E. Peterson and Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich, has a foreword by former President of Harvard, [[Lawrence Summers]]. It makes the case that poor or average scores on the international [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) test will cause the US to lose its economic pre-eminence over other nations.  Worse, "''America's failure to educate is affecting its national security''", according to a 2012 task force co-chaired by former New York City school chancellor [[Joel Klein]] and former US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]].<ref>{{cite Q|Q106908308}}<!-- U.S. Education Reform and National Security -->, p. 3;  emphasis in the original.  Cited on p. 4 of Hanushek et al. (2013).</ref> Moreover, if the US educational achievement were to match that of Canada, their model suggests that over the next 80 years, the average annual income of every worker in the United States "would be 20 percent higher, all other things being equal.  Discounted to the present, the gains from a faster-growing economy over the lifetime of someone born today would amount to five times our current GDP."<ref>Hanushek et al. (2013, p. 12).</ref>
