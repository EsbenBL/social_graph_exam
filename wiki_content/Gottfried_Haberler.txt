'''Gottfried von Haberler''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaːbɐlɐ|lang}}; July 20, 1900 – May 6, 1995) was an Austrian-American economist. He worked in particular on [[international trade]]. One of his major contributions was reformulating the [[David Ricardo|Ricardian]] idea of [[comparative advantage]] in a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical framework]], abandoning the [[labor theory of value]] for an [[opportunity cost]] concept.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Gottfried Haberler's Contributions to International Trade Theory and Policy |first=Robert E. |last=Baldwin |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |year=1982 |pages=141–48 |jstor=1882631 | doi = 10.2307/1882631 }}</ref>

Haberler was born in [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1900, and was educated in the [[Austrian School]] of economics. In 1936 he moved to the United States, joining the economics department at [[Harvard University]]. There he worked alongside [[Joseph Schumpeter]].

Haberler's two major works were ''Theory of International Trade'' (1936) and ''Prosperity and Depression'' (1937).

He was President of the  [[International Economic Association]] (1950–1953).

In 1957 the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] commissioned a report on the [[terms of trade]] for primary commodities, and Haberler was appointed Chairman. The report found that there was a decline in the terms of trade for primary producers, since 1955 commodity prices were said to have fallen by 5%, while industrial prices rose by 6%. Haberler's report seems to echo the report written by [[Raúl Prebisch]] in 1949 as well as Hans Singer in 1950. However, when a second Prebisch's report for the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) came out in 1964, Haberler denounced it. His particular disagreement was with the idea that there was a systematic long-term (secular) decline in the terms of trade.

In 1971, Haberler left Harvard to become a resident scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]].

He died from [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1995/05/09/economist-gottfried-haberler-a-defender-of-free-trade-dies/e84ba099-382e-4893-b79e-5b267bf42958/|title=ECONOMIST GOTTFRIED HABERLER, A DEFENDER OF FREE TRADE, DIES|work=The Washington Post|access-date=May 14, 2020}}</ref>
