'''Hernando de Soto Polar''' (commonly known as simply '''Hernando de Soto''' {{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|s|oʊ|t|oʊ}}; born June 2, 1941) is a prominent Peruvian [[economist]] known for his work on the [[informal economy]] and on the importance of business and [[property rights]].<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Timothy|date=2005|title=The work of economics: how a discipline makes its world|journal=European Journal of Sociology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=299|doi=10.1017/S000397560500010X|quote=de Soto became the country's leading advocate of neoliberal reorganization|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-04-05|title=En unas elecciones impredecibles, la única certeza en Perú es que habrá segunda vuelta|url=https://www.france24.com/es/am%C3%A9rica-latina/20210405-en-unas-elecciones-impredecibles-la-%C3%BAnica-certeza-en-per%C3%BA-es-que-habr%C3%A1-segunda-vuelta|access-date=2021-04-07|website=[[France 24]]}}</ref> His work on the developing world has earned him praise worldwide by numerous heads of state, particularly for his publication ''The Mystery of Capital'' and ''The Other Path''.

==Early life and education==
De Soto was born on 2 June 1941 in [[Arequipa]], Peru. His father José Alberto Soto was a Peruvian diplomat and lawyer.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|date=28 August 2006|title=Cablegate: Bio for GOP Special Trade Envoy Hernando de Soto|url=https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WL0608/S00916/cablegate-bio-for-gop-special-trade-envoy-hernando-de-soto.htm?from-mobile=bottom-link-01|access-date=2020-12-11|website=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]]}}</ref> After the [[Manuel A. Odría|1948 military coup in Peru]], his parents chose exile in Europe, taking their two young sons with them. His father worked for the [[International Labour Organization]] following their exile and would often send de Soto back to Peru during the summer months.<ref name=":6" /> 

In exile, de Soto was educated in Switzerland where he attended the [[International School of Geneva]]. He studied [[social psychology]] in [[National University of Saint Augustine]] in [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]. He returned to [[Geneva]] and received a bachelor's degree in [[economics]] from the [[University of Geneva]]. In 1967, he earned a master's degree in international law and economics from [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]], also in [[Geneva]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/magazine/in-defense-of-the-black-market.html|title=In defense of the black market|author=The New York Times|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1987-02-22}}</ref>

His younger brother Álvaro served in the Peruvian diplomatic corps in Lima, [[New York City]] and [[Geneva]] and was seconded to United Nations in 1982. He retired from the U.N. in 2007 with the title rank of Assistant Under-Secretary-General; his last position was as the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alvaro de Soto|title=End of Mission Report|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2007/06/12/DeSotoReport.pdf|access-date=31 August 2015}}</ref>

==Economics career==
Following his post-graduate studies, he worked as an economist for the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], a precursor to the [[World Trade Organization]], as well as president of the Committee of the Copper Exporting Countries Organization, CEO of Universal Engineering Corporation and a principal for [[Swiss Bank Corporation]].<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite web|title=ILD President- De Soto|url=https://www.ild.org.pe/about-us/ild-president|access-date=2020-12-11|website=www.ild.org.pe}}</ref>

=== Founding of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy ===
De Soto returned to Peru on the behalf of [[Gold placer claim|gold placer]] investors at the age of 38 in 1979 at a time when neoliberal policy was moving from the fringes of economic theory to mainstream practice.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":11" /><ref>Source: ''Investors Business Daily'', Monday November 6, 2006. p. A4. Leaders & Success. Article by IBD Reinhardt Kraus.</ref> Upon de Soto's return in 1979, he met with [[Friedrich Hayek]], a free market proponent who helped create the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name=":11" /> Hayek, who sought to promote neoliberalism through a network of "second hand dealers", choosing de Soto.<ref name=":14" /> After making connections with Hayek, de Soto was acquainted with Sir [[Antony Fisher]], a British businessman who created the [[Atlas Network]], a nonprofit libertarian umbrella group that consolidated funds and research from businesses in the United States and Europe in order to create neoliberal organizations in developing countries.<ref name=":11" /> 

With the assistance and funding of Fisher and the Atlas Network, de Soto created the [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy]] (ILD) in 1981, one of the first neoliberal organizations in Latin America.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":11" /> De Soto would later state "Anthony gave us enormous amounts of information and advice on how to get organized. ... It was on the basis of his vision that we designed the structure of the ILD".<ref name=":11" /> In 1984, de Soto received further assistance from the United States president [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration, with the [[National Endowment for Democracy]]'s Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) providing ILD with funding and education for advertising campaigns.<ref name=":21" /><ref name=":11" /> In 2003, the CIPE would later describe the ILD as being one of its most successful programs.<ref name=":11" /> Other funding was then provided by [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the [[Smith Richardson Foundation]], with USAID assisting the ILD with staging international networks to propagate their ideals.<ref name=":14" /> The ILD would then seek popular support in Peru by making informal housing their main concern.<ref name=":11" /> 

=== Fujimori government ===
Between 1988 and 1995, de Soto and the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) were mainly responsible for some four hundred initiatives, laws, and regulations that led to significant changes in Peru's [[economic system]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>[http://www.theglobalist.com/AuthorBiography.aspx?AuthorId=32 The Globalist | Biography of Hernando de Soto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911100830/http://www.theglobalist.com/AuthorBiography.aspx?AuthorId=32 |date=2006-09-11 }}</ref> The ILD became involved with the Peruvian economy at the end of President [[Alan García]]'s term.<ref name=":11" /> De Soto's group began to grown and advertised to the Peruvian public promoting their legislative goals, borrowing some advertisements from American lotteries.<ref name=":11" />

De Soto then began to serve informally as "the President's personal representative" for the first three years of the administration of Alberto Fujimori. De Soto had originally been a part of the economics advisory team of the unsuccessful presidential candidate [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] [[1990 Peruvian general election|in 1990]], but Fujimori later requested de Soto's assistance in resolving the economic issues that were produced by the [[Lost Decade (Peru)|crisis of the 1980s]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described de Soto as an "overseas salesman" for the government of [[Alberto Fujimori]] in 1990, writing that he had represented the government when meeting with [[creditors]] and the United States representatives.<ref name=":1" /> Others dubbed de Soto as the "informal president" for Fujimori.<ref name=":21" /> 

In a recommendation to Fujimori, de Soto called for a "shock" to Peru's economy.<ref name=":21">{{Cite book|last=Pee|first=Robert|title=The Reagan Administration, the Cold War, and the Transition to Democracy Promotion|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2018|isbn=978-3319963815|pages=178–180}}</ref> De Soto convinced then-president Fujimori to travel to [[New York City]] in a meeting organized by the Peruvian [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], secretary general of the United Nations, where they met with the heads of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], who convinced him to follow the guidelines for economic policy set by the international financial institutions.<ref name=":21" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Times|first=Paul Lewis and Special To the New York|date=July 1990|title=NEW PERU LEADER IN ACCORD ON DEBT|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/world/new-peru-leader-in-accord-on-debt.html|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> The policies included a three-hundred percent tax increase, unregulated prices and privatizing two-hundred and fifty state-owned entities.<ref name=":21" /> The policies of de Soto caused macroeconomic stability and a reduction in the rate of [[inflation]], though Peru's poverty rate remained largely unchanged with over half of the population living in poverty in 1998.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":21" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pee|first=Robert|title=The Reagan Administration, the Cold War, and the Transition to Democracy Promotion|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2018|isbn=978-3319963815|pages=187–188}}</ref> Peru would not see increased growth until the [[2000s commodities boom]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Toni |title=Peru's Mineral Wealth and Woes |url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/perus-mineral-wealth-and-woes |website=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |access-date=10 April 2021 |language=en |date=9 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gacs |first1=David |title=How Peru Could Survive The End Of The Commodities Supercycle |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/peru-after-the-end-of-commodities-boom-2014-1 |access-date=10 April 2021 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=7 January 2014}}</ref>

[[University of Chicago]] political scientist [[Susan Stokes|Susan C. Stokes]] believes that de Soto's influence helped change the policies of Fujimori from a [[Keynesian]] to a neoliberal approach.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} De Soto also inspired Fujimori's anti-drug initiatives.<ref name=":6" /> The [[Cato Institute]] and ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine have argued that de Soto's policy prescriptions brought him into conflict with and eventually helped to undermine the [[Shining Path]] (Sendero Luminoso) guerrilla movement. By granting titles to small [[coca]] farmers in the two main coca-growing areas, they argued that the Shining Path was deprived of safe havens, recruits and money, and the leadership was forced to cities where they were arrested.<ref name="cato.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/special/friedman/desoto/index.html|title=Hernando de Soto's Biography|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="economist">{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/people/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1559905 | work=The Economist | title=The economist versus the terrorist | date=30 January 2003}}</ref> Attacks were launched against the ILD and de Soto in light of the statements by Shining Path leader [[Abimael Guzmán]], who saw ILD as a threat.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB64/peru33.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ild.org.pe/publications/books/the-other-path|title=The Other Path|website=www.ild.org.pe|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref>

==== Land title initiative ====
Between 1992 and 1994, de Soto's ILD piloted a [[land title]] program to formally register 200,000 Peruvian households and two years later, expanded the program to Lima and seven other metropolitan areas that held ninety percent of informal housing developments within Peru.<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Timothy|date=2005|title=The work of economics: how a discipline makes its world|journal=European Journal of Sociology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=299–310|doi=10.1017/S000397560500010X|doi-access=free}}</ref> The program concluded in 2004 with 1.4 million households being registered and 920,000 land titles being provided.<ref name=":11" /> 

Contrary to de Soto's claims, the land title project provided no change to the access of credit to poor Peruvians.<ref name=":11" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cockburn|first=Calderon J.|title=Regularization of Land in Peru: Landlines|publisher=[[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]]|year=2000|location=[[Cambridge, MA]]}}</ref> The ILD's figures reported that homeowners also saw their [[Work hours|hours at work]] increase by seventeen percent, while working at home decreased by forty-seven percent and child labor was reduced by twenty-eight percent, with the group stating that the latter two statistics were due to homeowners and their children no longer being required to defend their homes from seizure.<ref name=":11" /> According to [[Timothy Mitchell]], the ILD's findings were "implausible" since the conclusion was already framed by the ILD, neighborhoods were already collective with limited property conflicts and those included in the project were already pursuing work outside of their homes when they chose to become involved.<ref name=":11" /> Following the findings, the ILD would distance itself from advocating credit access and instead promote increased work hours among formal landowners.<ref name=":11" />

==== Resignation and condemnation of Fujimori ====
De Soto resigned from his post as the "Personal Representative of the President" in January 1992, two months prior to the [[1992 Peruvian coup d'état]], and condemned Fujimori's motivations being influenced by Director of the [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|National Intelligence Service]] [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], hinting at signs of corruption. In his letter, he called into question "the validity of the anti-drug agreement" that Fujimori adopted. He stated his reasons to resigning as due to "[[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] from within the State that sabotages efforts in the fight against drugs", and reportedly due to differences with Montesinos.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gorriti|first=Gustavo|date=1992-01-31|title=Dimite el asesor de Fujimori para la lucha antidroga|language=es|work=El País|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1992/02/01/internacional/696898812_850215.html|access-date=2021-04-06|issn=1134-6582}}</ref> Both Montesinos and Fujimori would later be indicted for corruption and violation of human rights.

Two months after de Soto resigned, Fujimori launched a self-coup which de Soto again condemned as "stupid, unproductive and blatantly unconstitutional".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hernando de Soto: "El 5 de abril fue una estupidez, antiproductivo e inconstitucional"|url=https://www.ild.org.pe/ild-in-the-news/174-2015/1103-hernando-de-soto-el-5-de-abril-fue-una-estupidez-antiproductivo-e-inconstitucional|access-date=2021-04-06|website=www.ild.org.pe}}</ref> According to de Soto, one month after the coup the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Peru)|Minister of Economy]] [[Carlos Boloña]] contacted de Soto in desperation, after dozens of countries sanctioned Peru economically by cutting it off from investment and credit in response to the undemocratic event. Boloña resigned from his ministerial post, and de Soto lastly travelled to the 1992 [[Organization of American States]] summit in the Bahamas with Fujimori and pressured him to accept democratic elections to prevent another macroeconomic crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|last=LR|first=Redacción|date=2016-04-04|title=Hernando de Soto: "El 5 de abril fue una estupidez, antiproductivo e inconstitucional" {{!}} VIDEO|url=https://larepublica.pe/politica/757601-hernando-de-soto-el-5-de-abril-fue-una-estupidez-antiproductivo-e-inconstitucional/|access-date=2021-04-06|website=larepublica.pe|language=es-PE}}</ref>

=== International policy ===

==== Washington Consensus ====
De Soto was a main contributor to the [[Washington Consensus]], a set of ten economic prescription requirements set by [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury]] towards countries in economic crisis.<ref name=":14" /><ref name="piie.com2">Williamson, John: [https://piie.com/commentary/speeches-papers/what-washington-means-policy-reform "What Washington Means by Policy Reform"], in: Williamson, John (ed.): ''Latin American Readjustment: How Much has Happened'', Washington: [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] 1989.</ref> Neoliberal economists in the United States utilized de Soto's arguments as a way to promote the consensus.<ref name=":14" /> English economist [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]], who coined the term "Washington Consensus", partly credited de Soto for the prescriptions, saying his work was "the outcome of the worldwide intellectual trends to which Latin America provided".<ref name=":14" /> For United States presidents Ronald Reagan and [[George H. W. Bush]], according to Kate Geohegan of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies]], "de Soto's ideas offered a compelling new framework for explaining the problem of economic underdevelopment that seemed to affirm the wisdom of neoliberal policies like adjustment lending".<ref name=":14" />

The Washington Consensus would result in socioeconomic exclusion and weakened [[trade unions]] in Latin America, resulting with unrest in the region. The consensus resulted with a shrinking middle class in Latin America that prompted dissatisfaction of neoliberalism, a [[Pink tide|turn to the political left]] and [[populist]] leaders by the late-1990s; in Bolivia, support for [[Evo Morales]] was established.<ref name=":20">{{Cite journal|last=Rovira Kaltwasser|first=Cristobal|date=2010|title=Moving Beyond the Washington Consensus: The Resurgence of the Left in Latin America|journal=Internationale Politik und Gesellschaft|publisher=[[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]]|volume=3|pages=52–62}}</ref><ref name="HELLINGER">{{Cite book|last=Hellinger|first=Daniel|title=Comparative Politics of Latin America: Democracy at Last?|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781134070077}}</ref>

==== North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ====
Upon its signing, de Soto expressed support for the creation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)]].<ref name=":16" /> When announcing NAFTA at the Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group on 27 September 1989, President George H. W. Bush – who had adopted de Soto's work for the United States' foreign policy towards the economies of developing countries<ref name=":14" /> – praised de Soto for helping inspire [[free trade]].<ref name=":17" />

In his speech announcing NAFTA at the 1989 meeting, Bush stated:<ref name=":17" /><ref name=":19" />

{{Blockquote|text=All across the world, there has been an almost simultaneous rediscovery of the power created when individuals are given the freedom to act in their own best interests. ... True, we are here today mainly to discuss economic freedom. ... The Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto, has helped us understand a worldwide economic phenomenon. ...

According to de Soto in 1993, "the virtues of a modern society" were able to be introduced to Latin America as a result of NAFTA.<ref name=":16" /> He would later say in 2001 that Mexico's economy and institution would progress due to NAFTA, concluding "All poor countries are lumped together and all rich countries are lumped together; there's this imitation effect".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview with Hernando de Soto {{!}} Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis|url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org:443/article/2001/interview-with-hernando-de-soto|access-date=2021-04-09|website=www.minneapolisfed.org|language=en}}</ref>

In 2006, de Soto served as a personal representative of President [[Alan García]], and negotiated the [[Peru–United States Trade Promotion Agreement|Peru-United States Free Trade Agreement]] after 11 rounds of negotiation. In 2009, the ILD turned its attention back to Peru and the plight of the indigenous peoples of the Peruvian Amazon jungle. In response to Peru's President García's call to all Peruvians to present their proposals toward solving the problems leading to the bloody incidents in Bagua, the ILD assessed the situation and presented its preliminary findings. ILD published a short videotaped documentary, ''The Mystery of Capital among the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon'', summarizing its findings from indigenous communities in Alaska, Canada and the Peruvian jungle.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Enrique Escalante|first1=Edwar|title=Peru: The Mystery of Capital among the Indigenous People of the Amazon|url=http://www.hacer.org/latam/peru-the-mystery-of-capital-among-the-indigenous-people-of-the-amazon-by-edwar-enrique-escalante/|website=Hacer Latin America|access-date=31 July 2015|date=2009-09-30}}</ref>

After previously working with her father Alberto, de Soto joined [[Keiko Fujimori]] with her election campaigns for the [[2011 Peruvian general election|2011]] and [[2016 Peruvian general election]] when Fujimori committed to implementing de Soto's property rights reforms.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" />  In an interview during the first campaign ok Keiko Fujimori, he also stated that [[Osama bin Laden]]'s death was achieved thanks to land titling, a concept he holds as a way out of poverty.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hernando de Soto: Gracias a la titulación se atrapó a Osama Bin Laden {{!}} Servindi - Servicios de Comunicación Intercultural|url=http://www.servindi.org/file/hernando-de-soto-gracias-la-titulacion-se-atrapo-osama-bin-laden|access-date=2021-05-17|website=www.servindi.org}}</ref> As part of the Fuerza Popular team, he harshly criticized [[Peruvians for Change]] candidate [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]], whom he described as a "deserter and coward."

== Political career ==
=== 2001 Peruvian general election ===
For the [[2001 Peruvian general election]], de Soto sought to run for president with his Popular Capital party, though he failed to register the party on time in order to participate.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite web|date=2004-11-28|title=Tapia: De Soto buscó alianza con la izquierda el 2001|url=https://larepublica.pe/politica/310993-tapia-de-soto-busco-alianza-con-la-izquierda-el-2001/|access-date=2020-12-11|website=[[La República]]|language=es-PE}}</ref> At the time, he sought support from left-wing political groups for his candidacy, though they disagreed with his liberal economic policies.<ref name=":8" /> He would later become a critic of such groups.<ref name=":8" /> 

After learning about de Soto's inability to register for the election, former president and leader of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] Alan Garcia offered the economist the APRA's presidential nomination. De Soto declined the offer, claiming that he would have been "a figurehead president susceptible to the whims of disciplined APRA congressmen". Later, Garcia offered de Soto the position of Prime Minister, a role that Alberto Fujimori had also offered de Soto. De Soto declined again, not wanting to be held accountable for Garcia's government policies.
=== 2021 presidential campaign ===

De Soto announced his candidacy for president in September 2020 under the party [[Go on Country]]. Prior to the announcement, De Soto expressed hesitation to formally run for president lest politicizing and potentially delegitimizing work done by the [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy|ILD]] and himself on [[dead capital]].

On 30 October 2020, De Soto presented his technical team, which included the former president of CONFIEP Miguel Vega Alvear, businessman Carlos Añaños, former [[Fujimorism|Fujimori]] minister and first Vice President [[Francisco Tudela]], former GEIN commander Marco Miyashiro, the former head of the [[Operation Chavín de Huántar|Operation Chavín de Huantar]] José Williams, the diplomat Álvaro de Soto, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hernando de Soto integra a su equipo técnico a Julia Príncipe y Marco Miyashiro [VIDEO]|url=https://www.latina.pe/noticias/90/politica/hernando-de-soto-integra-a-su-equipo-tecnico-a-julia-principe-y-marco-miyashiro|access-date=2021-05-11|website=www.latina.pe|date=31 October 2020|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=LR|first=Redacción|date=2021-01-14|title=Avanza País: una estructura de campaña en proceso|url=https://larepublica.pe/elecciones/2021/01/14/avanza-pais-una-estructura-de-campana-en-proceso-pltc/|access-date=2021-05-11|website=larepublica.pe|language=es-PE}}</ref>

On December 14, 2020, de Soto published polls on the Willax Television program Beto viz. That poll ranked him first. De Soto spoke in the interview that: "The way this (the cadres) comes to us is because people very close to the state apparatus, it seems, were outraged at the enormous difference between the polls they handle."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-15|title=Hernando De Soto afirma que lidera la "verdadera" encuesta nacional|url=https://elbuho.pe/2020/12/hernando-de-soto-afirma-que-lidera-la-verdadera-encuesta-nacional-video/|access-date=2021-05-17|website=El Búho|language=es}}</ref>

Another strike was filed against him by a citizen, because he points out that Hernando de Soto "''has entered in the Academic Training section of the resume, which has the academic degree 'demi license en sciences economiques' awarded by the Universite de Geneve, which would have been obtained in 1964''.”.

==Main thesis==
The main message of de Soto's work and writings is that no nation can have a strong [[market economy]] without adequate participation in an information framework that records ownership of property and other economic information.<ref>"The Destruction of Economic Facts", by Hernando de Soto. April 28, 2010. Bloomberg ''[[BusinessWeek]]''. Accessed online May 2, 2011 [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_19/b4227060634112.htm]</ref> [[Black market|Unreported, unrecorded economic activity]] results in many small entrepreneurs who lack legal ownership of their property, making it difficult for them to obtain credit, sell the business, or expand. They cannot seek legal remedies to business conflicts in court, since they do not have legal ownership. Lack of information on income prevents governments from collecting taxes and acting for the public welfare.

<blockquote>The existence of such massive exclusion generates two parallel economies, legal and extra legal. An elite minority enjoys the economic benefits of the law and globalization, while the majority of entrepreneurs are stuck in poverty, where their assets—adding up to more than US$10 trillion worldwide—languish as [[dead capital]] in the shadows of the law.<ref name="Soto, Hernando 2000">de Soto, Hernando. 2000. The Mystery of Capital. UK: Black Swan.</ref>

To survive, to protect their assets, and to do as much business as possible, the extralegals create their own rules. But because these local arrangements are full of shortcomings and are not easily enforceable, the extralegals also create their own social, political and economic problems that affect the society at large.

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, responsible nations around the developing world have worked hard to make the transition to a market economy, but have in general failed.<ref>de Soto 2000, 1</ref> Populist leaders have used this failure of the free market system to wipe out poverty in the developing world to beat their "anti-globalization" drums. But the ILD believes that the real enemy is within the flawed legal systems of developing nations that make it virtually impossible for the majority of their people—and their assets—to gain a stake in the market. The people of these countries have talent, enthusiasm, and an astonishing ability to wring a profit out of practically nothing`.<ref name="Soto, Hernando 2000"/>

What the poor majority in the developing world do not have is easy access to the legal system which, in the advanced nations of the world and for the elite in their countries, is the gateway to economic success, for it is in the legal system where property documents are created and standardized according to law. That documentation builds a public memory that permits society to engage in such crucial economic activities as identifying and gaining access to information about individuals, their assets, their titles, rights, charges and obligations; establishing the limits of liability for businesses; knowing an asset's previous economic situation; assuring protection of third parties; and quantifying and valuing assets and rights.<ref>[[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]], "[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/document_ontology/Seale&deSoto.pdf "Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", in Barry Smith, David Mark and Isaac Ehrlich (eds.), ''[http://www.opencourtbooks.com/books_n/mystery.htm The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality]'', Chicago: Open Court, 2008, 35–51.</ref> These public memory mechanisms in turn facilitate such opportunities as access to credit, the establishment of systems of identification, the creation of systems for credit and insurance information, the provision for housing and infrastructure, the issue of shares, the mortgage of property and a host of other economic activities that drive a modern market economy.<ref>Institute for Liberty and Democracy, ''The ILD's war against exclusion'', p. 19. 2009</ref></blockquote>

== Work and research ==

Since 2008, de Soto has been refining his thesis about the importance of property rights to development in response to his organization's findings that a number of new global threats have "property rights distortions" at their root. In essays, that appeared from early 2009 into 2012 in media outlets in the U.S. and Europe, de Soto argued that the reason why the U.S. and European economies were mired in recession was the result of a "knowledge crisis" not a financial one.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sheridan|first1=Barrett|title=Economy: Slumdogs vs. Wall Street Millionaires|url=http://www.newsweek.com/economy-slumdogs-vs-wall-street-millionaires-82171|website=Newsweek|access-date=16 August 2015|date=2009-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Destruction of Economic Facts|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2011-04-27/the-destruction-of-economic-facts|website=Bloomberg Business|access-date=16 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Toxic Assets Were Hidden Assets|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123793811398132049|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=25 March 2009|access-date=16 August 2015|last1=Soto|first1=Hernando de}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=What if you can't prove you had a house?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/20/opinion/20iht-edsoto.html?_r=1&|website=The New York Times|date = 20 January 2006|access-date=16 August 2015|last1 = Soto|first1 = Hernando de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Knowledge Crisis Strategy|url=http://www.ild.org.pe/our-work/property-paradigm/the-knowledge-crisis-strategy|website=ild.org.pe|access-date=16 August 2015}}</ref> He has termed housing assets as "dead capital," in his papers on household ownership and deeds.<ref name="Rust">{{cite web |url=https://www.magzter.com/article/Investment/Finweek-English/Household-resilience-is-tied-to-the-house |title=Household resilience is tied to the house |author=Illana Melzer and Kecia Rust |date=October 6, 2020 |website=www.magzter.com |publisher=Magzter Finweek English |access-date=October 6, 2020}}</ref>
 
"Capitalism lives in two worlds," De Soto wrote in the ''Financial Times'' in January 2012. "There is the visible one of palm trees and Panamanian ships, but it is the other – made up of the property information cocooned in laws and records – that allows us to organize and understand fragments of reality and join them creatively."<ref>{{cite web|title=Knowledge lies at the heart over western capitalism|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4520ccda-4769-11e1-b847-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F4520ccda-4769-11e1-b847-00144feabdc0.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&_i_referer=&classification=conditional_standard&iab=barrier-app|website=Financial Times|access-date=16 August 2015}}</ref> De Soto argued that the knowledge in those public memory systems, which "helped Capitalism triumph," was distorted over the past 15 years or so.

After losing core funding from USAID, ILD laid off the majority of their employees from their San Isidro office. In 2014–2015, de Soto and a small team working out of his house began to attempt to guide the political process in Peru, as presidential elections were due to take place in 2016, by finding solutions to the ongoing national mining crisis. De Soto has been a strong advocate for the formalisation of the informal miners that are scattered throughout Peru.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diariocorreo.pe/ciudad/juliaca-hernando-de-soto-propondra-formalizacion-a-mineros-572009/|title=Juliaca: Hernando de Soto propondrá formalización a mineros|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gestion.pe/politica/hernando-soto-propone-hacer-comunidades-accionistas-mineras-2136954|title=Hernando de Soto propone hacer a las comunidades accionistas de las mineras|first=Redacción|last=Gestión|date=11 July 2015|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> Since 2014, several large national investment projects, including Las Bambas, and Tia Maria have been disrupted by violent protests by informal miners against government regulation and formal extractive industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diariocorreo.pe/opinion/conga-tia-maria-y-las-bambas-621747/|title=Conga, Tía María y Las Bambas|date=30 September 2015|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> In July 2015, de Soto alleged that former Shining Path militants who have taken up the ecological cause were paralyzing some $70 billion in mining investment in Peru.<ref name="elcomercio.pe">{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/politica/actualidad/soto-hay-us70-mil-mlls-inversion-minera-paralizada-noticia-1823604|title=De Soto: "Hay US$70 mil mlls. de inversión minera paralizada"|first=Mariella|last=Balbi|date=5 July 2015|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, recorded video debates between the former extremists and de Soto were published on ILD's YouTube channel and revealed that the Shining Path militants agree that property rights could be an important part of the solution to social conflicts in Peru.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gpfp1PRJ-c|title=Hernando de Soto Y Anti-Mineros (Segmento #1)|last=Institute for Liberty and Democracy|date=8 July 2015|access-date=16 August 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> De Soto's stated goal is to determine the roots of informal hostility against multinationals and identify what is needed to build a national social contract on extractive industries that could harmonize their property interests with those of [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]] as opposed to creating conflict.<ref name="elcomercio.pe" />

=== De Soto applies thesis to terrorism ===

In October 2014, de Soto published an article in ''The'' ''Wall Street Journal,'' "The Capitalist Cure for Terrorism", that stated an aggressive agenda for economic empowerment was needed in the Middle East in order to defeat terrorist groups like [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. He argued that the U.S. should promote an agenda similar to what was successfully used in Peru to defeat the [[Shining Path]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-capitalist-cure-for-terrorism-1412973796|title=The Capitalist Cure for Terrorism|first=Hernando de|last=Soto|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=10 October 2014|access-date=16 August 2018|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref> He also mentions in the article that local policymakers in the Middle East are missing the fact that if ordinary people cannot play the game legally, they will be far less able to resist a terrorist offensive. The article received praise among high-level global politicians such as US Presidential candidates [[Rand Paul]] and [[Jeb Bush]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/02/04/exclusive-education-jeb-bush |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125051438/http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/02/04/exclusive-education-jeb-bush |archive-date=2015-11-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/rand-paul-isis-benghazi-and-bringing-us-troops-home-290947|title=Rand Paul on ISIS, Benghazi and Bringing U.S. Troops Home|date=11 December 2014|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref>

Once again In January 2016, de Soto released his second article, How to Win the War on Terror, which focused on defeating terrorism through promoting strong property rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economia.icaew.com/opinion/global-review-2015-winter/how-to-win-the-war-on-terror|title=How to win the war on terror|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> The article was distributed by Project Syndicate and published in dozens of countries and languages, including in Switzerland by the World Economic Forum in advance of their 2016 forum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/this-is-how-we-can-win-the-war-on-terror|title=This is how we can win the war on terror|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/mundo/ee-uu-y-canada/como-ganarle-la-guerra-al-terrorismo-analisis/16490102|title=Cómo ganarle la guerra al terrorismo / Análisis|first=Casa Editorial El|last=Tiempo|website=El Tiempo|date=23 January 2016|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref>

=== De Soto challenges Thomas Piketty ===

In 2014, de Soto started to refute French economist [[Thomas Piketty]]’s thesis by arguing that his recent attacks against capital in his worldwide best seller book ''[[Capital in the 21st Century]]'' were unjustified.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hernando de Soto refuted the theories of Thomas Piketty|url=http://elcomercio.pe/economia/opinion/hernando-soto-refuto-teorias-thomas-piketty-noticia-1808487|website=El Comercio Portfolio|date=4 May 2015|access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref> His op-ed article challenging Piketty, ‘The Poor Against Piketty’ (French: Les pauvres contre Piketty) was first published in France's news magazine ''Le Point'' in April 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/editos-du-point/sebastien-le-fol/les-pauvres-contre-piketty-16-04-2015-1922011_1913.php|title=Les pauvres contre Piketty|last=magazine|first=Le Point|date=2015-04-16|newspaper=Le Point|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref>

De Soto argued that Piketty's statistics ignore the ninety percent of the world population that lives in developing countries and former Soviet states, whose inhabitants produce and hold their capital in the [[informal sector]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Thomas Piketty is wrong about capital in the 21st century|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/why-thomas-piketty-is-wrong-about-capital-in-the-21st-century-10251801.htm|website=The Independent|access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, he states that his institute's global research proves that most people actually want more rather than less capital. Finally, he argues that the wars against capital, which Piketty claims are coming, have already begun under Europe's nose in the form of the [[Arab Spring]] in the Middle East and North Africa.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Canoy|first1=Marcel|title=Why De Soto owns Piketty|url=http://www.ild.org.pe/ild-in-the-news/174-2015/971-why-de-soto-owns-piketty|access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref> 

=== De Soto addresses Pope Francis ===
In February 2016, de Soto took a break from countering Piketty's work and wrote an article addressing [[Pope Francis]]’s trip to Mexico titled, A Mexican Impasse for the Pope.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/pope-francis-property-rights-by-hernando-de-soto-2016-02?barrier=true|title=A Mexican Impasse for the Pope - by Hernando de Soto|first=Hernando de|last=Soto|date=11 February 2016|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> The article encourages the Pope and the Vatican to address the lack of property rights among the poor in countries like Mexico as a solution to global refugee crises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neurope.eu/article/the-pope-and-property-rights/|title=The Pope and property rights|date=15 February 2016|access-date=16 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216092601/http://neurope.eu/article/the-pope-and-property-rights/|archive-date=2016-02-16|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/helping-those-without-rights-to-step-out-of-the-shadows-381405.html|title=Helping those without rights to step out of the shadows|date=12 February 2016|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref>

A week later, de Soto published a second article in Fortune Magazine addressing the Pope's and US Republican Presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]]’s public spat over [[Trump's border wall|building a wall]] on the Mexican-USA border. The article titled, ''What Pope Francis Should Really Say to Donald Trump'', conveys five property rights related thoughts that the Pope should use to respond to Trump.<ref name="fortune.com">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/pope-francis-donald-trump-immigration/|title=What Pope Francis Should Really Say to Donald Trump|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> The article led to many different opinion articles featured in conservative outlets such as ''[[Breitbart]]'' and [[Investor's Business Daily|''Investors Business Daily'']].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investors.com/politics/capital-hill/pope-francis-keeps-listening-to-the-wrong-peruvian/|title=Pope Francis Keeps Listening To The Wrong Peruvian|last=Daily|first=Investor's Business|date=2016-02-19|newspaper=Investor's Business Daily|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://stream.org/pope-francis-hernando-de-soto-poor-property-rights/|title=Pope Francis and Economist Hernando de Soto Agree on One Thing: Free the Poor by Protecting Their Property Rights {{!}} The Stream|date=2016-02-17|newspaper=The Stream|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref>

===Blockchain work===
In May 2015, de Soto attended the 1st Annual Block Chain Summit hosted by British billionaire [[Richard Branson]] at his private Caribbean residence, [[Necker Island (British Virgin Islands)|Necker Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blockchainsummit.io/|title=Block Chain Summit|last=Bitfury|website=www.blockchainsummit.io|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/shaping-serendipity|title=Shaping serendipity|last=admin|date=16 June 2015|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> De Soto was one of three moderators, along with Michael J. Casey, former ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' senior columnist and Matthew Bishop, editor at ''[[The Economist]]''. Advocates of [[blockchain (database)|blockchain]] technology argue that it is well-suited to acting as a public ledger to help achieve de Soto's objective of formalising the informally-held property rights of groups like the indigenous peoples of Peru.<ref>https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/01/venture-capitalist-bill-tai-my-summer-reading-list-commentary.html.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/06/02/bitbeat-grand-plans-for-bitcoin-from-necker-island/|title=BitBeat: Grand Plans for Bitcoin From Necker Island|last=Casey|first=Michael J.|newspaper=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortaleciendocapacidades.lamula.pe/2015/05/28/culmina-cumbre-que-reune-a-las-mentes-mas-brillantes-del-mundo/habilidadesdiferentes/|title=CULMINA CUMBRE QUE REÚNE A LAS MENTES MÁS BRILLANTES DEL MUNDO|access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifoldsflip.com/i/598242-techonomy-magazine-2015|title=Techonomy Report - Techonomy Magazine 2015|website=www.ifoldsflip.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/03/could-blockchain-technology-help-the-worlds-poor|title=Could blockchain technology help the world's poor?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref>

==Reception==

=== Ideology ===
De Soto's promotion of [[neoliberalism]] in [[developing countries]] has faced criticism as supporting the exploitation of poorer nations.<ref name=":18">{{Cite web|last=Nicolas|first=Sandra|date=July 2004|title=GMA's de Soto: Rich People's Reformist|url=https://www.bulatlat.com/news/4-23/4-23-soto.html|website=Bulatlat}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Timothy|date=2005|title=The work of economics: how a discipline makes its world|journal=European Journal of Sociology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=306|doi=10.1017/S000397560500010X|doi-access=free}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' described de Soto as "a radical free-market economist".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-04-11|title='People don't want any of them': Peru election sees unpredictable contest|url=http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/10/peru-elections-presidential-candidates|access-date=2021-04-11|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en}}</ref> Geohegan states that the United States government under President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his successor [[George H. W. Bush]] adopted de Soto's work as the main strategy of the [[United States' foreign policy]] towards developing countries since "de Soto's interpretation of underdevelopment seemed to validate the emerging 'neoliberal' US policies".<ref name=":14">{{Cite book|last=Pee|first=Robert|title=The Reagan Administration, the Cold War, and the Transition to Democracy Promotion|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2018|isbn=978-3319963815|pages=168–187}}</ref> According to de Soto, Peru was not poor because of [[international inequality]] enforced by the globalized economy but due to Peru's own [[economic regulation]].<ref name=":14" /> Reagan – whose administration provided funding to found de Soto's ILD<ref name=":11" /> –  George H. W. Bush and Bush's successor [[Bill Clinton]] would continue promoting de Soto's work.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNC News release -- Noted economist de Soto to discuss property rights|url=http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/oct04/fpg_desoto101904.html|access-date=16 August 2018|website=www.unc.edu}}</ref> [[Timothy Mitchell]] says that de Soto's background as a European economist was often ignored by American neoliberals promoting him, writing that his popularity and experience "came to depend on his identity as a neoliberal from the third world, willing to describe the poverty of the global south as a self-inflicted injury unconnected to its relationship to the north".<ref name=":13" />  Administrator of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) [[Andrew Natsios]] would later advocate de Soto's work, stating "Instead of seeing the developing world as victims of capitalism, Hernando argues 'We're inflicting our own wounds' ... Since he is Peruvian, he can make this argument credibly".<ref name=":13" />

The promotion of neoliberalism by de Soto was not only utilized by officials in the United States; other neoliberal economists endorsed de Soto due to his origins from the developing world as well, with Mitchell stating that his background "transformed de Soto into a very useful asset for the neoliberal movement".<ref name=":13" /> President of the [[Atlas Network]], Alex Chaufen, said that de Soto was often discussed among the neoliberal community, stating "During the years I spent with [[Antony Fisher|Antony [Fisher]]] at Atlas, I couldn't recall any conversation, any speech about think tanks, any fundraising letter where he did ''not'' mention Hernando".<ref name=":13" />

As de Soto began to work with the government of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] in the Philippines in 2004, [[investigative journalism]] website Bulatlat described de Soto's work as "rich people's reformism", writing "The secret to de Soto's and ILD's popularity among political, economic and developmental elites ultimately lies in their unashamed conservatism, defense of the status quo and promise of capitalist wealth for the world's poor and exploited. ... Elites get to keep the property they value so much and can continue exploiting and oppressing while the poor – and historically exploited and oppressed – are diverted from systemic struggles by the chimera of becoming wealthy entrepreneurs themselves".<ref name=":18" /> In his ''Planet of Slums'', [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]] argues that de Soto, who Davis calls "the global guru of neo-liberal populism", is essentially promoting what the statist left in South America and India has always promoted{{snf}}individual land titling.<ref name=":15">Mike Davis, ''Planet of Slums'', Verso, 2006 pp. 79–82</ref> Davis argues that titling is the incorporation into the formal economy of cities, which benefits more wealthy squatters but is disastrous for poorer squatters, and especially tenants who simply cannot afford incorporation into the fully commodified formal economy.<ref name=":15" />

=== Property rights ===
De Soto's works on [[Right to property|property rights]] has voiced diverse views on the effect of the [[Titling|titling of land]].<ref>Bruce, J., Migot-Adholla, S. (Eds.), 1994.

==== Reception from scholars ====
Empirical studies by Argentine economists Sebastian Galiani and Ernesto Schargrodsky found a modest relationship between titling and credit market access (contradicting de Soto's research), but have also pointed out that families with titles "substantially increased housing investment, reduced household size, and improved the education of their children relative to the control group".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2010-10-01|title=Property rights for the poor: Effects of land titling|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272710000654|journal=Journal of Public Economics|language=en|volume=94|issue=9–10|pages=700–729|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.06.002|issn=0047-2727|last1=Galiani|first1=Sebastian|last2=Schargrodsky|first2=Ernesto}}</ref><ref>[http://coase.org/workingpapers/wp-7.pdf Galiani, Sebastian and Ernesto Schargrodsky.

"De Soto’s proposal is not wealth transfer, but wealth legalization. The poor of the world already possess trillions in assets now. De Soto is not distributing capital to anyone. By making them liquid, everyone’s capital pool grows dramatically".<ref name="Biswas">{{cite web|title=Dey Biswas, Sattwick. 2014.

In the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'', [[Christopher Woodruff]] of the [[University of California, San Diego]] criticized de Soto for overestimating the amount of wealth that land titling now informally owned property could unlock, and argues that "de Soto's own experience in Peru suggests that land titling by itself is not likely to have much effect. Titling must be followed by a series of politically challenging steps. Improving the efficiency of judicial systems, rewriting bankruptcy codes, restructuring financial market regulations, and similar reforms will involve much more difficult choices by policymakers."<ref>[http://epserv.unila.ac.id/jurnal/BAhan/Jurnal%20Of%20Economic%20lietratur/Content/2001/dec/articles/woodruff.pdf Woodruff, Christopher.

==== Reception from governmental officials ====
The argument for private and often individualist property regime comes under the question of societal legitimacy, may not be justified even if de Soto eyes bringing a unified system in a state or unification with the global economy.<ref name="Biswas" /> 

His work has also received praise from two [[United Nations]] secretaries general [[Kofi Annan]] – "Hernando de Soto is absolutely right, that we need to rethink how we capture economic growth and development"<ref>{{cite web|title=TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE BY SECRETARY-GENERAL KOFI ANNAN AT INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION, GENEVA, 16 JULY 2001 - Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/sgsm7892.doc.htm|access-date=16 August 2018|website=www.un.org}}</ref> – and [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] – "A crucial contribution.

A study commissioned by [[DFID]], an agency of the [[U.K. government]], further summarized many of the complications arising from implementing de Soto's policy recommendations when insufficient attention is paid to the local social context.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Daley, Elizabeth and Mary Hobley.

==== Reception from activists ====
Grassroots controlled and directed shack dwellers movements like [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto – MTST) in Brazil<ref>[http://www.mtst.info MTST – Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706135612/http://www.mtst.info/|date=2008-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Home - Friends of the MST|url=http://www.mstbrazil.org/|access-date=16 August 2018|website=www.mstbrazil.org}}</ref> have strenuously argued against individual titling and for communal and democratic systems of collective land tenure because this offers protection to the poorest and prevents 'downward raiding' in which richer people displace squatters once their neighborhoods are formalized.

=== Publications ===
Neoliberal politicians and organizations promoted de Soto's publications, with their endorsements and awards making his books bestsellers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Timothy|date=2005|title=The work of economics: how a discipline makes its world|journal=European Journal of Sociology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=307–308|doi=10.1017/S000397560500010X|doi-access=free}}</ref> Since the publication of ''The Mystery of Capital'' in 2000 and subsequent translations, his ideas have become increasingly influential in the field of development economics. Scholars have disputed that there is a significant relationship between land titles and credit market access. 

In the [[World Development]] journal, a 1990 article by R. G. Rossini and J. J. Thomas of the [[London School of Economics]] questioned the statistical basis of de Soto's claims about the size of the informal economy in his first book ''The Other Path''.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VC6-45CWV65-32/2/0eeb1e04e92415f8fb6c2e3efaae1ee7 Rossini, R.

Instead, [they focused] exclusively on four empirical estimates that the book [mentioned] only in passing".<ref>{{cite journal|date=1 January 1990|title=A reply|journal=World Development|volume=18|issue=1|pages=137–145|doi=10.1016/0305-750X(90)90108-A}}</ref> 

On January 31, 2012, de Soto and his publisher were fined by the Peruvian intellectual property rights organization INDECOPI for excluding the names of co-authors [[Enrique Ghersi]] and Mario Ghibellini in newer editions of his 1986 book ''The Other Path''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perú: Condenan por infracción a derecho moral de paternidad a economista Hernando de Soto|url=http://iptango.blogspot.ca/2012/02/peru-condenan-por-infraccion-derecho.html|access-date=21 June 2014|website=IP Tango: weblog for intellectual property law and practice for Latin America}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/economia/peru/sancionan-hernando-soto-violacion-propiedad-intelectual-noticia-1368239|title = Sancionan a Hernando de Soto por violación de propiedad intelectual &#124; ECONOMIA|date = 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Archived copy|url=http://sistemas.indecopi.gob.pe/SPI_Jurisprudencia/documentos/1-45/2012/0040-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151832/http://sistemas.indecopi.gob.pe/SPI_Jurisprudencia/documentos/1-45/2012/0040-2012.pdf|archive-date=2015-07-21|access-date=2015-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Archived copy|url=http://www.indecopi.gob.pe/0/modulos/NOT/NOT_DetallarNoticia.aspx?PFL=0&NOT=382|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034223/http://www.indecopi.gob.pe/0/modulos/NOT/NOT_DetallarNoticia.aspx?PFL=0&NOT=382|archive-date=2015-09-24|access-date=2015-07-21}}</ref>

=== Relationship with elites ===
An article by [[Madeleine Bunting]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK) claimed that de Soto's suggestions would in some circumstances cause more harm than benefit, and referred to The Mystery of Capital as "an elaborate smokescreen" used to obscure the issue of the power of the globalized elite. She cited de Soto's employment history as evidence of his bias in favor of the powerful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/sep/11/imf.comment|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|title=Fine words, flawed ideas|work=The Guardian|date=11 September 2000}}</ref> Reporter John Gravois also criticized de Soto for his ties to power circles, exemplified by his attendance at the [[Davos]] [[World Economic Forum]]. In response, de Soto told Gravois that this proximity to power would help de Soto educate the elites about poverty. [[Ivan Osorio]] of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] has refuted Gravois's allegations pointing out how Gravois has misinterpreted many of de Soto's recommendations.<ref name="Osorio">{{Cite web |url=http://cei.org/gencon/019,04389.cfm |title=Osorio, Ivan.

==Publications==

===Books===
De Soto has published two books about economic development: ''The Other Path: The Invisible Revolution in the Third World'' in 1986 in Spanish (with a new edition in 2002 titled ''The Other Path, The Economic Answer to Terrorism'') and in 2000, ''The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else'' ({{ISBN|978-0465016150}}). Both books have been international bestsellers, translated into some 30 languages.

The original [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] title of ''The Other Path'' is ''El Otro Sendero'', an allusion to de Soto's alternative proposals for development in Peru, countering the attempts of the "[[Shining Path]]" (''"Sendero Luminoso"'') to win the support of Peru's poor. Based on five years worth of ILD research into the causes of massive informality and legal exclusion in Peru, the book was also a direct intellectual challenge to the Shining Path, offering to the poor of Peru not the violent overthrow of the system but "the other path" out of poverty, through legal reform. In response, the Senderistas added de Soto to their assassination list. In July 1992, the terrorists sent a second car bomb into ILD headquarters in Lima, killing 3 and wounding 19.

In addition, he has written, with Francis Cheneval, ''Swiss Human Rights Book Volume 1: Realizing Property Rights'', published in 2006 – a collection of papers presented at an international symposium in Switzerland in 2006 on the urgency of property rights in impoverished countries for small business owners, women, and other vulnerable groups, such as the poor and political refugees. The book includes a paper on the ILD's work in Tanzania delivered by Hernando de Soto.<ref>[http://www.swisshumanrightsbook.com/SHRB/home.html De Soto, Hernando and Francis Cheneval.
