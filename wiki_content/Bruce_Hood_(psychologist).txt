'''Bruce MacFarlane Hood''' is a Canadian-born British experimental [[psychology|psychologist]] and philosopher who specialises in [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]]. He is currently based at the [[University of Bristol]] and his major research interests include intuitive theories, self identity, essentialism and the cognitive processes behind adult magical thinking.

==Biography==
Hood completed undergraduate studies in psychology, then received a Master of Arts and a [[Master of Philosophy]] from the [[University of Dundee]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = S. | last2 = Hood | first2 = B. | authorlink2 = Bruce Hood (psychologist)| doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1987.tb02260.x | title = The stress of the transition to university: A longitudinal study of psychological disturbance, absent-mindedness and vulnerability to homesickness | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–441 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3427309 }}</ref> He received a PhD from [[University of Cambridge]] in 1991, studying the visual development of infants.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://search.lib.cam.ac.uk/?itemid=%7Cmanuscrpdb%7C9627|title = Development of visual selective attention in the human infant|accessdate = 13 September 2014|website = LibrarySearch|publisher = University of Cambridge|last = Hood|first = Bruce MacFarlane}}</ref> After moving to the US he took a place as a visiting professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and faculty professor at [[Harvard University]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hood | first1 = B.

== Work ==

=== Cognitive development in childhood ===
In his research, Hood investigates various aspects of cognitive development in children. He best known for discovering a naïve theory of gravity<ref>Tecwyn E.C., Buchsbaum D. (2018) Hood’s Gravity Rules. In: Vonk J., Shackelford T. (eds)
Encyclopedia of Animal Cognition and Behavior. Springer,</ref> and looking at the origins of superstitious beliefs in children. Most notably, his research showed that children inherently prefer 'their' individual objects over duplicated ones <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenshealthtoday.blog/2017/11/21/the-comfort-of-childhood-toys-and-attachment/|title=The Comfort of Childhood Toys and Attachment|date=21 November 2017}}</ref>
a behaviour which persists into adulthood.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Picasso Paintings, Moon Rocks, and Hand-Written Beatles Lyrics: Adults' Evaluations of Authentic Objects|last = Frazier|first = BN|date = January 2009|journal = Journal of Cognition and Culture|doi = 10.1163/156853709X414601|pmid = 20631919|volume=9|issue = 1–2|pages=1–14|pmc=2903069}}</ref> Further, he investigates how children use gaze to infer about the mental states of humans they are interacting with.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Children's use of the temporal dimension of gaze for inferring preference|last = Einav|first = S|date = January 2006|journal = Developmental Psychology|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.142|pmid = 16420124|volume=42|issue = 1|pages=142–52}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Tell-tale eyes: children's attribution of gaze aversion as a lying cue|last = Einav|first = S|date = November 2008|journal = Developmental Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0013299|pmid = 18999328|volume=44|issue = 6|pages=1655–67|citeseerx = 10.1.1.507.978}}</ref>

=== Science of Happiness ===
Since 2018, Hood has been delivering the ''Science of Happiness'' course at [[University of Bristol]] as well as other universities and organizations. Modelled after the successful ''Psychology and the Good Life'' course initiated by [[Laurie Santos]] at [[Yale University]], the programme has been shown to improve mental well-being<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/24/bristol-university-happiness-course-students-found-to-be-more-upbeat|title = Bristol University happiness course students found to be more upbeat|date = 24 March 2021}}</ref> and is the basis for the BBC podcast ''The Happiness Half-Hour''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p08r2ymx|title = BBC Sounds - the Happiness Half Hour - Available Episodes}}</ref> co-presented by Hood.

=== Public engagement ===
Hood has been engaging in science outreach since the beginning of his career. In 2009, he published his first popular science book''SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable''. The book tackles how the human brain generates superstitious beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/are-we-born-believers-or-cultural-receivers-a-discussion-with-author-and-psychologist-bruce-hood/|title = Are We Born Believers or Cultural Receivers? A Discussion with Author and Psychologist Bruce Hood|date = 22 May 2009|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = Neuronarrative|publisher = WordPress.com|last = DiSalvo|first = David}}</ref>
Hood argues that humans evolved to "detect patterns in the world" and defines the supersense as the "inclination to infer that there are hidden forces that create the patterns that we think we detect".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/bruce_m._hood_supersense_why_we_believe_in_the_unbelievable/|title=Bruce M. Hood – Supersense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable|author=D. J. Grothe|author-link=D. J. Grothe|publisher= [[Point of Inquiry]]|date=17 April 2009|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>
Contrary to prominent skeptics such as [[Richard Dawkins]], Hood is convinced that superstitious beliefs are inevitable and even beneficial to humans. For instance, he argues that [[essentialism]] is beneficial to social interactions, since it allows humans to overcome objectification and attribute uniqueness to other humans. However, Hood clearly differentiates between secular and religious beliefs, where secular supernatural beliefs are universally applicable across cultures and religious beliefs are culturally specific. He also argues that secular superstitious beliefs do predispose humans to religious beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.forgoodreason.org/bruce_hood_why_we_believe_in_the_unbelievable|title = Why we believe in the unbelievable|date = 28 March 2010|accessdate = 8 September 2014|website = For Good Reason|publisher = For Good Reason|last = Grothe|first = DJ|author-link = DJ Grothe|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006104643/http://www.forgoodreason.org/bruce_hood_why_we_believe_in_the_unbelievable|archive-date = 6 October 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>

In 2012, Hood published his second popular science book ''The Self Illusion: Why there is no 'you' inside your head'' (published under the alternative title ''The Self Illusion: How the social brain creates identity'' in America). In this book, he argues that the human sense of self is a construct of the brain which facilitates experiencing and interacting with the world.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url = https://www.wired.com/2012/05/the-self-illusion-an-interview-with-bruce-hood/|title = The Self Illusion: An Interview With Bruce Hood|date = 25 May 2012|accessdate = 13 September 2014|magazine = Wired|last = Lehrer|first = Jonah|author-link = Jonah Lehrer}}</ref> "Who we are," Hood writes, "is a story of our self − a constructed narrative that our brain creates".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hood|first1=Bruce|title=The Self Illusion|date=2012|publisher=Constable|location=London|isbn=978-1-78033-007-5|page=xi}}</ref> Bruce uses a "a distinction that William James drew between the self as "I" and "me." Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the "I" and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the "me" which again is a coherent account of who we think we are based on past experiences, current events and aspirations for the future."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url = https://www.wired.com/2012/05/the-self-illusion-an-interview-with-bruce-hood/|title = The Self Illusion: An Interview With Bruce Hood|date = 25 May 2012|accessdate = 3 February 2016|magazine = Wired|last = Lehrer|first = Jonah|author-link = Jonah Lehrer}}</ref>

In October 2012, Hood devised the world's largest simultaneous memory experiment for the [[Society of Biology]] involving 2000 participants to demonstrate the phenomenon of false memories.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2012/8872.html|title = Bristol professor designs game for Guinness World Record attempt|date = 19 October 2011|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}</ref> This was officially recognised by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.societyofbiology.org/news/news-archive/14-news/477-society-of-biology-sets-new-world-record|title = Society of Biology sets new World Record|date = 11 June 2013|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = Society of Biology|publisher = The Society of Biology|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071043/https://www.societyofbiology.org/news/news-archive/14-news/477-society-of-biology-sets-new-world-record|archive-date = 6 October 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Hood's third popular science book, ''The Domesticated Brain'', was published in 2014 and explores the neuro-cognitive origins and consequences of social behaviour in humans. The book's thesis is that "over the most recent evolution, the last 20,000 years", humans have been "selecting each other for prosocial behaviour and that has changed our brains and the way we've become more codependent".<ref name=skepticuleinterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticule.co.uk/2015/05/skepticule-094-20150425.html|title=''Skepticule 094: Question.Explore.Discover – QEDcon 2015, Manchester, UK – Special Episode 1 of 2 (inc. interview with Bruce Hood)''|first1=Paul|last1=Thompson|first2=Paul S.|last2=Jenkins|first3=Paul|last3=Orton|publisher= Skepticule|date=25 April 2015|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref> He presented this topic at [[The Royal Society of Arts]],<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2014/Bruce-Hood-on-the-Domesticated-Brain|title = Bruce Hood on the Domesticated Brain|date = 7 May 2014|accessdate = 17 September 2014|website = RSA Events|publisher = RSA|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140904115407/http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2014/Bruce-Hood-on-the-Domesticated-Brain|archive-date = 4 September 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> [[The Royal Society]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bristol.ac.uk/pace/public-events/bruce-hood.html|title = Royal Society talk – Professor Bruce Hood|date = 29 May 2014|accessdate = 13 September 2014|website = Bristol University Public and Ceremonial Events Office|publisher = University of Bristol|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140913033235/http://www.bristol.ac.uk/pace/public-events/bruce-hood.html|archive-date = 13 September 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> and the 2014 [[Cheltenham Science Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cheltenhamfestivals.com/science/whats-on/2014/bruce-hood-the-domesticated-brain/|title = Bruce Hood: The domesticated brain|accessdate = 13 September 2014|website = The Times Cheltenham Festivals Science '14|publisher = Cheltenham Festivals|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006170535/http://www.cheltenhamfestivals.com/science/whats-on/2014/bruce-hood-the-domesticated-brain/|archive-date = 6 October 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Hood's most recent book, ''Possessed: Why Do We Want More Than We Need?'' published in 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/314/314909/possessed/9780141991290.html|title = Possessed}}</ref> addresses the psychological mechanisms behind over-consumption and the link between materialism and self-identity building on the ideas of William James and Russell Belk's 'extended self-concept'.
In addition to books, Hood has appeared in numerous popular science podcasts, radio shows, TV series and documentary movies.<ref>Bruce Hood IMDB page https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4833187/</ref> In 2011, Hood was chosen to present the prestigious ''[[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]]'' entitled ''Meet Your Brain''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rigb.org/christmas-lectures/watch/2011/meet-your-brain|title=Meet your brain &#124; the Royal Institution: Science Lives Here}}</ref> The lectures were first broadcast on BBC4 and again on BBC2 in 2012. Hood also appeared in the award-winning eco-documentary movie ''Living in the Futures' Past''<ref>https://www.livinginthefuturespastfilm.com/</ref> co-produced and presented by academy award winner [[Jeff Bridges]].

=== Skepticism ===
[[File:Prof Bruce Hood talking at QED 2011 3.jpg|thumb|Professor Bruce Hood at the QED conference in Manchester 2011]] 
Hood played a key part in exposing the [[ADE 651]] bogus bomb detector and similar devices in January 2010. He got involved in exposing the scam upon realising that the devices were produced locally in Somerset (UK) and challenged the creator of the devices, Jim McCormick, to demonstrate their validity. Even though McCormick initially agreed to this, the demonstration was then delayed and McCormick later required Hood to sign a non-disclosure statement concerning their meeting. Hood had also contacted the [[BBC]] about McCormick and his fraudulent products, which ultimately resulted in the production of a [[BBC Newsnight]] documentary about [[ADE 651]] and a related device, the [[GT200]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8471187.stm|title = Export ban for useless 'bomb detector'|date = 22 January 2010|accessdate = 6 September 2014|publisher = BBC Newsnight|last1 = Hawley|first1 = Caroline|last2 = Jones|first2 = Meirion}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8520303.stm|title = Why did UK not ban so-called 'bomb detectors' earlier?|date = 17 February 2010|accessdate = 21 September 2014|publisher = BBC Newsnight|last1 = Jones|first1 = Meirion|last2 = Hawley|first2 = Caroline}}</ref> In this documentary, Hood demonstrates that the perceived effect of the devices can be explained by the [[ideomotor phenomenon]], which had fooled naive users.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/interview_with_bruce_m._hood/|title = Interview with Bruce M.
