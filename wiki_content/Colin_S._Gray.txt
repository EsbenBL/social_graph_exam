Gray was criticized by Alex Marshall of the University of Glasgow for his attempt to elevate [[Harry S. Truman]]'s reputation to "a level of adulation far higher than the historical record could ever objectively sustain", as well as for Gray's silence on Truman's intellectual mediocrity and role in bringing about the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|2012|pp=290–291}}
