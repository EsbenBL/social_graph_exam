However, criticism about Sri Mulyani's policy also came from ex [[Vice President of Indonesia|vice president]] [[Jusuf Kalla]]. In his harshest comments yet on the controversial PT Bank Century bailout, former Vice President Jusuf Kalla denied claims by former Bank Indonesia officials that if the lender had been allowed to fail it would have had a systemic impact on the country's banking system and economy.

“The Bank Century scandal is a robbery, anyone who supports Bank Century, supports a robber.” Kalla said.<ref>{{Cite news

Furthermore, all of the nine factions on the House of Representatives special committee agreed that there were suspicious and possibly fraudulent transactions during the bailout period beginning in November 2008 and evidence of money laundering. They all then said they lacked the expertise to do more and called on the [[Indonesian National Police|Indonesian National Police (Polri)]] and [[Corruption Eradication Commission|Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK)]] to take over.<ref>{{Cite news
