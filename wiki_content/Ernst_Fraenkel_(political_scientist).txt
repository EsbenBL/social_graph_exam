During the [[Weimar Republic]] Fraenkel was a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|social democrats]] and one of the few [[jurist]]s who held socialist opinions. According to some historians{{weasel inline|date=September 2015}} in the 1930s he was designated to be [[Attorney General]] of a possible social-democratic German government. In 1939 he immigrated to the United States where he began to develop his respect for the [[politics of the United States|politics of that country]], especially its [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] and its [[checks and balances]].

==Life==
Fraenkel was born in a [[German Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Cologne]]. He served during the [[First World War]] from 1916 to 1918 in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]. He wrote his [[dissertation]] in law about ''The void labour contract'' (''Der nichtige Arbeitsvertrag''), under [[Hugo Sinzheimer]].<ref>Ladwig-Winters (2009), p. 54.</ref>

During the [[Weimar Republic]] he worked as a lawyer for [[labor law]] with [[Franz Leopold Neumann]], published scientific publications and was engaged in socialist politics. Having been a soldier in World War I, he was still allowed to work to a limited extent even after the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power in 1933.<ref>Buchstein, Hubertus (2003) "Political Science and Democratic Culture: Ernst Fraenkel's Studies of American Democracy." ''German Politics & Society'', 21(3). p. 52.

In 1938 he finally immigrated to the [[United Kingdom]], in 1939 to the United States.

Shortly after arriving in New York Fraenkel moved to Chicago, where he studied American law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], graduating in 1941.<ref name="Buchstein53">Buchstein (2003), p. 53.</ref> During this period he revised and completed a manuscript that he had brought with him from Germany.<ref name="Buchstein53"/> In this work, published in 1941 as ''The Dual State'',<ref name="Buchstein53"/> he analyses the political system of the Nazi state. For Fraenkel there coexisted in the Nazi government a "normative state" (''Normenstaat''), which secured the continuation of capitalist society for those Germans not threatened by Nazism, and a "prerogative state" (''Maßnahmenstaat''), which used legal sanctions as well as brutal violence against people considered to be enemies of Nazism and [[Nazi Germany]].

Fraenkel lectured at the [[New School for Social Research]].

From 1945 on Fraenkel was an adviser to the American government but was soon dissatisfied with their policy of occupation in [[Korea]]. For the [[United Nations]] he was supposed to be one of the people to prepare free elections in Korea, but the [[Korean War]] made the elections impossible and forced Fraenkel to leave the country.

In 1951 Fraenkel returned to Germany. He became a lecturer at the [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]] in [[Berlin]] and later a professor at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]], where he founded the [[John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies]]. He considered his writings to be normative, his concept of pluralism was meant to criticize the existing political system. Those among his students who were active in the [[Movement of 1968|1968 movement]], however, saw his American-influenced theories as defending monopolistic capitalism. He died in [[Berlin]].
