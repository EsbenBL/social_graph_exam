== Research ==
Brooke Ackerly’s research has crossed between [[political theory]] and [[international relations]], with special interest in [[gender issues]] and [[political methodology]]. One of Ackerly’s biggest contributions has been theorizing [[universal human rights]], finding a middle ground between [[Relativism in ethics|relativism]] and [[essentialism]] built through the insights of women’s [[human rights activists]]. Her ''Political Theory and Feminist Social Criticism'' (Cambridge 2000) builds from field research, [[feminist theory]], and deliberative democracy theory, laying out a methodology for and theory of feminist social criticism.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Political Theory and Feminist Social Criticism|last=Ackerly|first=Brooke A.|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511490149|location=Cambridge|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511490149}}</ref> Her ''Universal Human Rights in a World of Difference''  (Cambridge 2008) builds on this theorizing, but with an emphasis on and attention to difference, disagreement, and diversity.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Universal Human Rights in a World of Difference|last=Ackerly|first=Brooke A.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511756016|location=Cambridge|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511756016}}</ref> With [[Jacqui True]] and Maria Stern, Ackerly edited ''Feminist Methodologies for International Relations'' (Cambridge 2006), which lays out both a theoretical approach to feminist methodologies for international relations and a variety of possible methods to be used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/international-relations-and-international-organisations/feminist-methodologies-international-relations?format=PB|title=Feminist methodologies international relations {{!}} International relations and international organisations|website=Cambridge University Press|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref> She has contributed to debates about the utility of quantitative methods for feminist theorizing, foci on people-centric notions of rights, discussions about reflexivity in research, and the role of deliberation in politics generally and feminist politics specifically, in ''Doing Feminist Research'' with [[Jacqui True]] (Palgrave 2010).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.macmillanihe.com/page/detail/doing-feminist-research-in-political-and-social-science-brooke-ackerly/?sf1=barcode&st1=9780230507760|title=Doing Feminist Research in Political and Social Science|language=en}}</ref>

Ackerly has also contributed theories of human rights, especially as it relates to [[global justice]]. Her newest book ''Just Responsibility: A Human Rights Theory of Global Justice'' (Oxford 2018), examines the difference between moral responsibility and political responsibility, and challenges conventional norms about responsibility and its basis in volition and cognition.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Just responsibility : a human rights theory of global justice|last=A.|first=Ackerly, Brooke|isbn=9780190662950|location=New York, NY|oclc=1012635421|date=February 2018}}</ref>

Ackerly has been at the forefront of recent developments in the "[[grounded normative theory]]” methodological approach. Grounded normative theory involves the direct incorporation and/or analysis of empirical research in the processes of normative theorizing. The approach dates at least to [[Jane Mansbridge]]’s 1980 monograph cum 1983 book, ''Beyond Adversary Democracy'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo3618381.html|title=Beyond Adversary Democracy|last=Mansbridge|first=Jane|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1983}}</ref>  which incorporated original field work at New England town meetings and a crisis helpline center. Ackerly has been perhaps the leading recent practitioner and proponent of the approach, especially in a more critical, solidaristic vein, where the scholar theorizes ''with'' those engaged in struggles over justice and social recognition.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Bryant|first=Antony|last2=Charmaz|first2=Kathy|date=2007|title=The SAGE Handbook of Grounded Theory|doi=10.4135/9781848607941|isbn=9781412923460}}</ref> Further, for Ackerly, grounded normative theorizing follows grounded theory as it has been more broadly developed in sociology and cognate disciplines - the method is inductive, developing normative theories from the empirical context upward, rather than bringing theoretical claims to the context.<ref name=":4" /> Ackerly began laying the theoretical groundwork for her own grounded interventions in her 2000 monograph, ''Political Theory and Feminist Social Criticism.''<ref name=":1" /> By 2008’s ''Universal Human Rights in a World of Difference,'' she was conducting and incorporating extensive field work involving participants at World Social Forums''.''<ref name=":2" /> Her most recent monograph, ''Just Responsibility'',<ref name=":3" /> presents a fully realized “feminist grounded normative theory approach.” It joins feminist methodologies and orientations to grounded normative theorizing. The book presents findings from Ackerly’s interviews and data and content analysis of 125 grant applications from organizations focused on women’s rights in 26 countries.<ref name=":3" />
