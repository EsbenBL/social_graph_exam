{{no refs|section|date=July 2020}}
Fuchs’ main research interests lie in the areas of sustainable development and international political economy. She specializes in conceptual topics such as power (especially structural and discursive power), sustainable consumption and financialization. Empirically, she focuses on environmental, energy, and agrifood policy, in particular. One of her central research interests is the political influence of non-state, especially economic, actors on [[ecological]] and social sustainability, in multi-level governance.
