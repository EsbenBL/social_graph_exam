'''Sidney Stuart Alexander''' (May 3, 1916 – February 19, 2005) was an American economist who was associated with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

[[Robert Solow|Robert M Solow]] lists him among his teachers saying "The Harvard of my time taught statistics scandalously badly. I would hardly have known what I was missing if Sidney Alexander, filling in for a couple of weeks as lecturer in the graduate course in economic statistics, had not lifted the curtain and let the class peek at the real thing". {{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

During World War II, Alexander served as a director of research in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).

From 1956 until his retirement, Alexander taught at MIT, in both the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and the Economics Department.
