'''Stephany Griffith-Jones''' (born June 5, 1947) is an [[economist]] specialising in [[international finance]] and [[Economic development|development]], with emphasis on reform of the [[international financial system]], specifically in relation to [[financial regulation]], [[global governance]] and international capital flows. She is currently financial markets director at the [[Initiative for Policy Dialogue]],<ref name=bio>[http://policydialogue.org/about/team/griffith-jones_stephany_team_financial_markets_program_director/ Initiative for Policy Dialogue website]</ref> based at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]] and associate fellow at the [[Overseas Development Institute]]. Previously she was professorial fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] at [[Sussex University]]. She has held the position of deputy director of International Finance at the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]] and has worked at the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] and in the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]]. She started her career in 1970 at the [[Central Bank of Chile]]. Before joining the [[Institute of Development Studies]], she worked at [[Barclays]] Bank International in the UK. She has acted as senior consultant to governments in Eastern Europe and Latin America and to many international agencies, including the [[World Bank]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[European Commission]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNDP]] and [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]. She was also a member of the Warwick Commission on international financial reform.<ref>[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/research/warwickcommission/about/commissioners/griffith-jones/ Warwick Commission bio]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> She has published over 20 books and written many scholarly and journalistic articles. Her latest book, edited jointly with [[José Antonio Ocampo]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], ''Time for the Visible Hand, Lessons from the 2008 crisis'', was published in 2010.

==Contributions to economic analysis and policy==
Griffith-Jones has contributed to research and policy suggestions on how to make the domestic and international financial system more stable so it can better serve the needs of inclusive economic development and the [[real economy]]. One of her first articles, ''The Growth of Multinational Banking, the Euro-currency market and their effects on developing countries''<ref>{{cite journal|title=The growth of multinational banking, the Euro-currency market and their effects on developing countries|journal=Journal of Development Studies |volume=16 |issue=2 |year=1980}}</ref> in the Journal of Development Studies, published in 1980, warned of the risk of excessive international [[bank lending]] to [[developing economies]].

Her 1986 book with Osvaldo Sunkel, ''Debt and Development Crises in Latin America: The End of An Illusion'', showed the negative effects of the 1980s [[Latin American debt crisis]] on the region's economic development.<ref>''Debt and Development Crises in Latin America: The End of An Illusion'', with Osvaldo Sunkel, Oxford University Press, 1986</ref> She was an early advocate of [[debt relief]] in [[Latin America]] and [[Sub-saharan Africa]].

Writing with [[Ricardo Ffrench-Davis]] in the 1990s she contributed to the debate on how [[Latin America]] could curb and manage volatile [[capital flows]].<ref>''Coping With Capital Surges: The Return of Finance to Latin America'', edited with Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, Lynne Rienner, 1995</ref> She again warned of the risks of costly [[financial crises]] if sufficient measures such as [[capital controls]] were not implemented.

After several financial crises, mainly in [[developing countries]], she started in the mid-1990s to advocate capital flow regulations in capital source countries as a way to curb excessive and volatile [[capital flows]].<ref>[http://www.fondad.org/uploaded/Currency%20Crises/CurrencyCrises-Griffith-Jones.pdf How Can Future Currency Crises Be Prevented or Better Managed?], in Teunissen, Jan Joost, ''Can Currency Crises Be Prevented or Better Managed? Lessons from Mexico'', FONDAD, 1996</ref> She believed this would reduce the risk of major reversals of capital flows and the [[financial crises]] that result from them. This is further discussed in her 1998 book ''Global Capital Flows, should they be regulated?''<ref>''Global Capital Flows, should they be regulated?'' with preface by [[Nobel prize]] winner  [[James Tobin]], Macmillan and St. Martin’s Press, 1998</ref>

In the discussion on reform of the [[international financial architecture]] she contributed to the analysis of crisis prevention, especially through financial regulation and more effective financial crisis management. For example, she advocated [[special drawing rights]] issues by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) as a means to provide official [[liquidity]] when private capital flows fall sharply. She also advocated expanded and less conditional IMF lending so countries do not have to unnecessarily adjust their economies, especially in the face of financial crises or other external shocks.

Writing with [[José Antonio Ocampo]] since the late 1990s<ref>[http://depot.gdnet.org/gdnshare/pdf2/gdn_library/annual_conferences/sixth_annual_conference/griffith_paper.pdf What Progress on International Financial Reform? Why so Limited?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814124917/http://depot.gdnet.org/gdnshare/pdf2/gdn_library/annual_conferences/sixth_annual_conference/griffith_paper.pdf |date=2011-08-14 }} - written with José Antonio Ocampo and Jacques Cailloux, EGDI, 1999</ref> they expanded the concept of [[counter-cyclical]] reform of the [[international financial system]] to help stabilise capital flows and domestic private lending. The aim was to avoid frequent costly crises, facilitate [[macro-economic]] management and to achieve stable and inclusive economic growth in developing countries.

She has worked on practical policy applications of these ideas. She has advocated reform of [[compensatory financing]] at the IMF in the face of external shocks to make it larger, speedier and with less [[conditionality]]. Similarly she was an early supporter of expanding [[International financial institutions|development banks]] - nationally, regionally and multilaterally - and their role in [[counter-cyclical]] lending. She has also advocated the issue of [[GDP-linked bonds]] as a [[counter-cyclical]] mechanism to reduce the risk of [[financial crises]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/b7155454-1039-11db-8f6f-0000779e2340.html "A bond that insures against instability"], with [[Robert J. Shiller]], The Financial Times, July 10, 2006</ref> She has long supported the idea of counter-cyclical regulation. These and other practical measures are aimed at reforming the [[financial system]] so that it supports stable inclusive economic growth without costly [[financial crises]].
