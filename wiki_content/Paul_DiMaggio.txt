'''Paul Joseph DiMaggio''' (born January 10, 1951 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]])<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.princeton.edu/sociology/faculty/dimaggio/dimaggio_cv.pdf | title = DiMaggio's CV | work = http://wagner.nyu.edu/dimaggio | accessdate = February 26, 2008}}</ref> is an American educator, and [[professor]] of [[sociology]] at [[New York University]] since 2015. Previously, he was a professor of sociology at [[Princeton University]].

==Biography==
A graduate of [[Swarthmore College]], DiMaggio earned his [[Ph.D.]] in sociology from [[Harvard]] in 1979. He was the executive director of [[Yale University|Yale's]] program on nonprofit organizations (1982–87), and through 1991 he was a professor in the sociology department at the university. He was a fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] (1984–85) and at the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] (1990). He also served on the [[Connecticut]] Commission on the Arts and on the board of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies. He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Paul+DiMaggio&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-02-18|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

==Work==
DiMaggio's major works have been in the study of institutions and organizations and the formation of "high culture" in the U.S. His recent research explores [[social inequality]] in the Internet.

According to DiMaggio, belief systems and cultural frames are imposed on and adapted by individual actors and organisations. Thus, roles are for a large part determined by larger structures.

In a much-quoted article, DiMaggio and [[Walter W. Powell]] argued that organizations, whether corporate, governmental, or non-profit, adopt business practices not because they are efficient, but because they furnish legitimacy in the eyes of outside stakeholders, e. g. lenders, government regulators, and shareholders, as they need to maintain the confidence of these often poorly-informed outside parties. This makes them less creative and innovative in their practices, and leads to [[isomorphism (sociology)|institutional isomorphism]].

In his cultural studies, DiMaggio's historical research documented the self-conscious creation of "high culture" in the late 19th-century America. DiMaggio argues that, unsettled by the weak [[class (social)|class]] distinctions in growing [[industrial revolution|industrial]] [[cities]], local [[elites]] created a "sophisticated" culture (via the [[arts]], [[universities]], [[social clubs]], and the like) that would separate commoners from those of high standing. DiMaggio says that "high culture" models developed by founders of  [[museums]] and [[orchestras]] were then adopted by patrons of [[opera]], [[dance]], and [[theatre]].

DiMaggio's recent research considers the cultural advent of the Internet. He compares the emergence of the Internet with the rise of [[television]] in the 1950s.<ref>Paul J. DiMaggio and Joseph Nathan Cohen (2005) "Information Inequality and Network Externalities: A Comparative Study in the Diffusion of Television and the Internet" in Richard Swedberg and [[Victor Nee]] (eds.) ''The Economic Sociology of Capitalism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press): 227 - 267.</ref> Television was introduced to American [[consumer]]s in 1948, and within ten years 90% of [[households]] had TV. In contrast, Internet diffusion (introduced on a large scale in 1994) seems to have stalled at approximately 60% of American households. DiMaggio believes that this difference is the result of the so-called [[digital divide]] - inequalities in Internet usage by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[income]], and [[education]] level. DiMaggio maintains that these inequalities were not found in the adoption of TV in the 1950s, and suggests that differences in Internet usage among social groups will continue. This remains an open question, and some recent data suggest Internet usage is growing, with more than 70% of American adults reporting that they use the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/182/report_display.asp|title=Reports: Internet Evolution|date=2006-04-25|publisher=Pew/Internet|accessdate=2007-09-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909055856/http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/182/report_display.asp|archivedate=September 9, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eszter.com/research/pubs/dimaggio-etal-digitalinequality.pdf |title=From Unequal Access to Differentiated Use }}&nbsp;{{small|(293&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.princeton.edu/~artspol/workpap/WP15%20-%20DiMaggio+Hargittai.pdf |title=From the 'Digital Divide' to 'Digital Inequality' }}&nbsp;{{small|(237&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}</ref>
