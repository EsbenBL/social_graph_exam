==Career==
===Academia===
Domhoff was an assistant professor of psychology at [[California State University, Los Angeles]] for three years in the early 1960s. In 1965, he joined the founding faculty<ref>{{cite web| title = G. William (Bill) Domhoff, founding faculty, and psychologist Calvin S. Hall, at the Cowell College fountain | publisher = UCSC | date = 1968 | url = http://digitalcollections.ucsc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/p265101coll25/id/5163/rec/6}}</ref> of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UCSC) as an assistant professor at [[Cowell College]]; he became an associate professor in 1969, a professor in 1976, and a Distinguished Professor in 1993. After his retirement in 1994, he has continued to publish and teach classes as a research professor.<ref name=UCSCinterview/><ref>Domhoff, G. William. "G. William Domhoff: Power Structure Research retrospective (1994)." [[YouTube]].</ref>

Over the course of his career at UCSC, Domhoff served in many capacities at various times: acting dean of the Division of Social Sciences,<ref name="UCSCPhoto-Dean">{{cite web |title=William (Bill) Domhoff, dean of the division of social sciences |url=http://digitalcollections.ucsc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/p265101coll25/id/14281/rec/12 |publisher=UCSC}}</ref> chair of the Sociology Department, chair of the Academic Senate, chair of the Committee on Academic Personnel, and chair of the Statewide Committee on Preparatory Education.<ref name=UCSCinterview/>
In 2007, he received the University of California's Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award, which honors the post-retirement contributions of UC faculty.<ref>{{cite news |title=UCSC's Michael Nauenberg wins UC distinguished emeriti award |url=https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2013/05/08/ucscs-michael-nauenberg-wins-uc-distinguished-emeriti-award/ |access-date=16 December 2019 |work=Santa Cruz Sentinel |date=8 May 2013}}</ref>

===Sociology===
Domhoff's first book, ''[[Who Rules America?]]'' (1967), was a 1960s sociological best-seller,<ref name=UCSCinterview/> arguing that the United States is dominated by an [[elite]] ownership class, both politically and economically.<ref name="bio_Gale">{{cite book |title=World of Sociology |publisher=Gale |date=November 2000 |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/george-william-domhoff-soc/ |isbn=978-0-7876-4965-4}}</ref> This work was partially inspired by Domhoff's experience of the [[Civil rights movement]] and projects he assigned for his social psychology courses mapping how different organizations were connected.<ref name="UCSCinterview" /> It built on [[E. Digby Baltzell]]'s 1958 book ''Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class'', [[C. Wright Mills]]'  1956 book ''The Power Elite'', [[Robert A. Dahl]]'s 1961 book ''Who Governs?'' and [[Paul Sweezy]] work on interest groups, and Floyd Hunter's 1953 book ''Community Power Structure'' and 1957 book ''Top Leadership, USA.''

''Who Rules'' was followed by a series of sociology and power structure books like ''[[C. Wright Mills]] and the Power Elite'' (1968), ''Bohemian Grove and Other Retreats'' (1978), and three more best-sellers: ''The Higher Circles'' (1970), ''The Powers That Be'' (1979), and ''Who Rules America Now?'' (1983).<ref name="UCSCinterview" />

Domhoff has written seven updates to ''Who Rules America?''; every edition has been used as a sociology textbook. He also has a "Who Rules America?" web site, hosted by UCSC.<ref>[http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/ "Who Rules America?"]</ref>
===Psychology===
In addition to his work in sociology, Domhoff has been a pioneer in the scientific study of [[dream]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keynote Speakers: 2017 Annual International Dream Conference |url=https://iasdconferences.org/2017/keynotes2017/ |publisher=International Association for the Study of Dreams}}</ref><ref name="DreamingInTheClassroom">{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Philip |last2=Bulkeley |first2=Kelly |last3=Welt |first3=Bernard |title=Dreaming in the Classroom: Practices, Methods, and Resources in Dream Education |date=2011 |publisher=SUNY Press |page=245}}</ref> In the 1960s, he worked closely with [[Calvin S. Hall]], who had developed a content analysis system for dreams. He has continued to study dreams up to the present day, and his latest research advocates a neurocognitive basis for future dream research.<ref>[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-emergence-of-dreaming-9780190673420 ''The Emergence of Dreaming'' (2018), Oxford University Press]</ref>

He and his research partner, Adam Schneider, maintain two web sites dedicated to quantitative dream research: DreamResearch.net and DreamBank.net.<ref name="DreamingInTheClassroom"/>
