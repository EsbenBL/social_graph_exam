==Public commentary==
===Higher education===
Vedder wrote in his June 2004 book ''Going Broke by Degree: Why College Costs Too Much'' that American universities have become less productive and less efficient in recent years as well as more likely to shift funds away their core mission of teaching. He also criticized rising tuition costs. He proposed as a broad solution moving state universities toward [[free market]] competition and [[privatization]]. He specifically recommended as well that colleges expand [[distance learning]], cut out non-educational programs, modify [[tenure]], raise teaching loads, and reduce administrative staffs.<ref name="broke" />

On May 27, 2011, Vedder appeared on the [[news]]/[[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] [[Television program|TV program]] ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' and stated that since "the cost of college is rising relative to the benefits of college," but "learning outcomes are stagnant or falling in this country," American society must "open up opportunities for people to consider a variety of different options after high school, one of which is college, but there are many others." Vedder also stated that "as many as one out of three college graduates today are in jobs that previously or historically have been filled by people with lesser educations, jobs that do not require higher-level learning skills, critical thinking skills, or writing skills or anything of that nature."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june11/college_05-27.html|title=Is a College Diploma Worth the Soaring Student Debt?|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=[[PBS NewsHour]]}}</ref>

===Government spending===
Vedder and writer [[Stephen Moore (writer)|Stephen Moore]] wrote in the ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial page in March 2011 that every new dollar of new taxes leads to more than one dollar of new spending according to their research. Thus, they found evidence in favor of the "[[Starve the beast#"Feed the Beast"|Feed the Beast]]" theory: that increasing taxes for the purported purpose of balancing the budget leads only to the government spending such inflows.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704648604575620502560925156|title=Higher Taxes Won't Reduce the Deficit|author1=Stephen Moore|date=November 21, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2011|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author2=Richard Vedder|author1-link=Stephen Moore (writer)}}</ref>

===U.S. bailout===
In the aftermath of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], Vedder stated that he "somewhat reluctantly" supported the $700 billion bailout package included in the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]]. He attributed the crisis to governmental failure and "public policy miscues," saying the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis of 2007 and 2008]] "never would have happened" in "the absence of these governmental mistakes."

=== Walmart wages ===
Vedder wrote, along with Wendell Cox, the December 2006 book ''The Wal-Mart Revolution'' in which they asserted that criticisms of [[Criticism of Walmart#Wages|wage practices at WalMart]] are "unfounded." He argued that Walmart workers are "paid fairly" given their skill and experience, and he stated that they also receive side benefits such as [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] that is fairly similar to competing firms. He further argued that communities with new Walmart stores have greater total employment and higher incomes.<ref name="walmart" />
