'''Robert Trelford McKenzie''' (11 September 1917 – 12 October 1981) was a [[Canadian]]  professor of [[politics]] and [[sociology]], and a [[psephologist]] (one who does [[statistics|statistical]] analysis of [[election]]s). He is perhaps most well known in Britain as one of the main presenters of the [[BBC]]'s General Election programmes.

==Early life==
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the son of William Meldrum McKenzie and Frances (née) Chapman, he was educated at King Edward High School and the [[University of British Columbia]] from which he graduated with a BA.<ref name="who's who">Who's Who 1974, London : A. & C. Black, 1974, p. 2091</ref> He was a lecturer at the same university from 1937 to 1942.<ref name="who's who"/> In 1943, he joined the [[Canadian Army]] and a year later, with the rank of captain, was sent to London where he remained for the rest of his working life.  Leaving the services three years later, McKenzie enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]] to study for a doctorate. In 1949, he was given a sociology lectureship, and was promoted to professor in 1964.

==Television==
He was widely known in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for his televised reports on [[general election]] results as they were announced on the [[BBC]]. He is popularly associated with the [[swingometer]] device used in such broadcasts. The swingometer was first introduced in 1955 by Peter Milne, and was later refined by McKenzie and [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and used nationally in the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 General election]] for the BBC. At first Butler used the meter, but in 1964 McKenzie enthusiastically took over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1369188.stm|title=Sultan of swingometers|work=BBC News|date=7 June 2001}}</ref> He appeared on all BBC election nights from 1955 to 1979, and was later replaced by [[Peter Snow]] in 1983 due to McKenzie's death in 1981. Additionally, he introduced and moderated the discussions in each episode of [[Milton Friedman]]'s 1980 television series ''[[Free to Choose]]''.

McKenzie also famously interviewed [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]] on the BBC programme ''Gallery'' in 1963, asking questions on the then recent scandal involving Conservative cabinet minister [[John Profumo]]. Hailsham became increasingly fractious as the interview progressed regarding McKenzie's line of questioning, even though Hailsham was strongly critical of Profumo's conduct.

==Other work==

He wrote many academic books and papers during his career, including ''British Political Parties: The Distribution of Power within the Conservative and Labour Parties'' and ''Angels in Marble: Working Class Conservatives in Urban England'', but it was through television and radio that his name became known. His broadcasting career began when he was requested by the [[BBC]] to give occasional talks on the Overseas Service; he was later invited to become involved in dramatic radio and TV, such as appearing as himself on [[Big Brother (Yes Minister)|an episode]] of the British series ''[[Yes Minister]]''.
