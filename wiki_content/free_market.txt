In [[economics]], a '''free market''' is a [[Economic system|system]] in which the [[price]]s for [[goods and services]] are self-regulated by buyers and sellers negotiating in an [[open market]]. In a free market, the laws and forces of [[supply and demand]] are free from any intervention by a [[Forms of government|government]] or other authority, and from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities.<ref name="Popper 1994"/> Proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a [[regulated market]] in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods such as [[tariff]]s used to restrict trade and to protect the local economy. In an idealized [[free-market economy]], also called a [[Economic liberalization|liberal market economy]], prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] without intervention by government policy.

Scholars contrast the concept of a free market with the concept of a [[Coordinated market economy|coordinated market]] in fields of study such as [[political economy]], [[new institutional economics]], [[economic sociology]] and [[political science]]. All of these fields emphasize the importance in currently existing market systems of rule-making institutions external to the simple forces of supply and demand which create space for those forces to operate to control productive output and distribution. Although free markets are commonly associated with [[capitalism]] in contemporary usage and [[popular culture]], free markets have also been components in some forms of [[Market socialism|socialism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bockman|first=Johanna|title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3}}</ref>

Criticism of the theoretical concept may regard systems with significant [[market power]], [[inequality of bargaining power]], or [[information asymmetry]] as less than free, with regulation being necessary to control those imbalances in order to allow markets to function more efficiently as well as produce more desirable social outcomes.

[[Economist]]s, [[historian]]s, [[political economist]]s and [[sociologist]]s have adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism and have recognized various forms of it in practice. These include ''[[Laissez-faire capitalism|laissez-faire]]'' or [[free-market capitalism]], [[state capitalism]] and [[welfare capitalism]]. Different [[forms of capitalism]] feature varying degrees of free markets, [[public ownership]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Gregory and Stuart|first=Paul and Robert|title=The Global Economy and its Economic Systems|date=28 February 2013|publisher=South-Western College Pub|isbn=978-1-285-05535-0|page=107|quote=Real-world capitalist systems are mixed, some having higher shares of public ownership than others.

[[Market economies]] have existed under many [[forms of government]] and in many different times, places and cultures. Modern capitalist societies—marked by a universalization of [[money]]-based [[social relations]], a consistently large and system-wide [[class of workers]] who must work for wages (the [[proletariat]]) and a [[capitalist class]] which owns the means of production—developed in Western Europe in a process that led to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Capitalist systems with varying degrees of direct government intervention have since become dominant in the [[Western world]] and continue to spread. Capitalism has been shown to be strongly correlated with [[economic growth]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sy|first=Wilson N.|date=18 September 2016|title=Capitalism and Economic Growth Across the World|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=2840425|quote=For 40 largest countries in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) database, it is shown statistically that capitalism, between 2003 and 2012, is positively correlated significantly to economic growth.}}</ref>

=== Georgism ===
{{main|Georgism}}
For classical economists such as [[Adam Smith]], the term free market does not necessarily refer to a market free from government interference, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities.<ref name="Popper 1994"/> This implies that [[economic rent]]s, i.e. profits generated from a lack of [[perfect competition]], must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition.

Economic theory suggests the returns to [[land]] and other [[natural resource]]s are economic rents that cannot be reduced in such a way because of their perfect inelastic supply.<ref>[[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' [[s:The Wealth of Nations/Book V/Chapter 2|Book V, Chapter 2]], Part 2, Article I: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses.</ref> Some economic thinkers emphasize the need to share those rents as an essential requirement for a well functioning market. It is suggested this would both eliminate the need for regular taxes that have a negative effect on trade (see [[deadweight loss]]) as well as release land and resources that are speculated upon or monopolised. Two features that improve the competition and free market mechanisms. [[Winston Churchill]] supported this view by the following statement: "Land is the mother of all monopoly".<ref>House Of Commons May 4th; King's Theatre, Edinburgh, July 17</ref> The American economist and social philosopher [[Henry George]], the most famous proponent of this thesis, wanted to accomplish this through a high [[land value tax]] that replaces all other taxes.<ref>Backhaus, "Henry George's Ingenious Tax," pp. 453–58.</ref> Followers of his ideas are often called [[Georgism|Georgists]] or geoists and [[Geolibertarianism|geolibertarians]].

[[Léon Walras]], one of the founders of the [[neoclassical economics]] who helped formulate the [[general equilibrium theory]], had a very similar view. He argued that free competition could only be realized under conditions of state ownership of natural resources and land. Additionally, income taxes could be eliminated because the state would receive income to finance public services through owning such resources and enterprises.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3|page = 21|quote= For Walras, socialism would provide the necessary institutions for free competition and social justice. Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}</ref>

=== ''Laissez-faire'' ===
{{main|Laissez-faire}}
The ''laissez-faire'' principle expresses a preference for an absence of non-market pressures on prices and wages such as those from discriminatory government [[tax]]es, [[Subsidy|subsidies]], [[tariff]]s, [[regulation]]s of purely private behavior, or [[Government-granted monopoly|government-granted]] or [[Coercive monopoly|coercive monopolies]]. In ''The Pure Theory of Capital'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] argued that the goal is the preservation of the unique information contained in the price itself.<ref name="hayek_pure">Hayek, Friedrich (1941). ''The Pure Theory of Capital''.</ref>

The definition of free market has been disputed and made complex by collectivist political philosophers and socialist economic ideas.<ref name="Popper 1994">{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies|publisher=Routledge Classics|year=1994|isbn=978-0-415-61021-6}}</ref> This contention arose from the divergence from [[classical economists]] such as [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] and from the continental [[economics]] developed primarily by the Spanish scholastic and French classical economists, including [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]]. During the [[Marginal utility#Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], [[Theory of value (economics)#Subjective theory of value|subjective value theory]] was rediscovered.<ref>{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Poverty of Historicism|publisher=Routledge Classics|year=2002|isbn=0415278465}}</ref>

Although ''laissez-faire'' has been commonly associated with [[capitalism]], there is a similar economic theory associated with [[socialism]] called left-wing or socialist ''laissez-faire'', also known as [[free-market anarchism]], [[Left-wing market anarchism|free-market anti-capitalism]] and [[Market socialism|free-market socialism]] to distinguish it from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism.<ref>Chartier, Gary; Johnson, Charles W.

And markets, properly understood, have always been about cooperation. As a commenter at Reason magazine's Hit&Run blog, remarking on [[Jesse Walker]]'s link to the Kelly article, put it: "every trade is a cooperative act." In fact, it's a fairly common observation among market anarchists that genuinely free markets have the most legitimate claim to the label "socialism."

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Socialism}}
{{See also|Socialist economics}}
Various forms of [[socialism]] based on free markets have existed since the 19th century. Early notable socialist proponents of free markets include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Benjamin Tucker]] and the [[Ricardian socialist]]s. These economists believed that genuinely free markets and [[voluntary exchange]] could not exist within the [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitative]] conditions of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]]. These proposals ranged from various forms of [[worker cooperative]]s operating in a free-market economy such as the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] system proposed by Proudhon, to state-owned enterprises operating in unregulated and open markets. These models of socialism are not to be confused with other forms of market socialism (e.g. the [[Lange model]]) where publicly owned enterprises are coordinated by various degrees of [[economic planning]], or where capital good prices are determined through marginal cost pricing.

Advocates of free-market socialism such as [[Jaroslav Vanek]] argue that genuinely free markets are not possible under conditions of private ownership of productive property. Instead, he contends that the class differences and inequalities in income and power that result from private ownership enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the market to their favor, either in the form of monopoly and market power, or by utilizing their wealth and resources to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests. Additionally, Vanek states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximize productivity because they would receive a share of the profits (based on the overall performance of their enterprise) in addition to receiving their fixed wage or salary. The stronger incentives to maximize productivity that he conceives as possible in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises might be accomplished in a free-market economy if [[employee-owned companies]] were the norm as envisioned by various thinkers including [[Louis O. Kelso]] and [[James S. Albus]].<ref>[http://www.ru.org/index.php/30-economics/357-cooperative-economics-an-interview-with-jaroslav-vanek "Cooperative Economics: An Interview with Jaroslav Vanek"]. Interview by Albert Perkins. Retrieved March 17, 2011.</ref>

Socialists also assert that [[free-market capitalism]] leads to an excessively skewed distributions of income and economic instabilities which in turn leads to social instability. Corrective measures in the form of [[social welfare]], re-distributive taxation and regulatory measures and their associated administrative costs which are required create agency costs for society. These costs would not be required in a self-managed socialist economy.<ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. pp. 197–198">''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko (1982), pp. 197–98.</ref>

== Concepts ==
=== Economic equilibrium ===
{{main|Economic equilibrium}}
[[File:FreePrice.JPG|thumb|Effects of price freedom]]
With varying degrees of mathematical rigor over time, the [[general equilibrium theory]] has demonstrated that under certain conditions of [[Perfect Competition|competition]] the law of [[supply and demand]] predominates in this ideal free and competitive market, influencing prices toward an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] that balances the demands for the products against the supplies.<ref>''Theory of Value'' by [[Gérard Debreu]].</ref> At these equilibrium prices, the market distributes the products to the purchasers according to each purchaser's preference or [[utility]] for each product and within the relative limits of each buyer's [[purchasing power]]. This result is described as market efficiency, or more specifically a [[Pareto optimum]].

This equilibrating behavior of free markets requires certain assumptions about their agents—collectively known as [[perfect competition]]—which therefore cannot be results of the market that they create. Among these assumptions are several which are impossible to fully achieve in a real market, such as complete information, interchangeable goods and services and lack of market power. The question then is what approximations of these conditions guarantee approximations of market efficiency and which failures in competition generate overall market failures. Several [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizes in Economics]] have been awarded for analyses of market failures due to [[asymmetric information]].

=== Low barriers to entry ===
{{main|Barriers to entry}}
A free market does not require the existence of competition, however, it does require a framework that allows new market entrants. Hence, in the lack of coercive barriers, for example, paid licensing certification for certain services and businesses, competition between businesses flourishes all through the demands of consumers, or buyers. It often suggests the presence of the [[profit motive]], although neither a profit motive or profit itself are necessary for a free market.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All modern free markets are understood to include [[entrepreneur]]s, both individuals and [[business]]es. Typically, a modern free-market economy would include other features such as a [[stock exchange]] and a [[financial services]] sector, but they do not define it.

=== Perfect competition and market failure ===
{{main|Market failure|Perfect competition}}
Conditions that must exist for unregulated markets to behave as free markets are summarized at [[perfect competition]]. An absence of any of these perfect competition ideal conditions is a [[market failure]]. Most schools of economics{{which|date=December 2018}} allow that regulatory intervention may provide a substitute force to counter a market failure. Under this thinking, this form of market regulation may be better than an unregulated market at providing a free market.

=== Spontaneous order ===
{{main|Spontaneous order}}
{{See also|Invisible hand}}
[[Friedrich Hayek]] popularized the view that market economies promote [[spontaneous order]] which results in a better "allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve".<ref>Hayek cited. Petsoulas, Christina. ''Hayek's Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment''. Routledge. 2001. p. 2.</ref> According to this view, market economies are characterized by the formation of complex transactional networks that produce and distribute goods and services throughout the economy. These networks are not designed, but they nevertheless emerge as a result of decentralized individual economic decisions. The idea of spontaneous order is an elaboration on the [[invisible hand]] proposed by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''. About the individual, Smith wrote:
<blockquote>By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.<ref>Smith, Adam (1827). ''The Wealth of Nations''. Book IV. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rpMuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA184#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 184].</ref></blockquote>

Smith pointed out that one does not get one's dinner by appealing to the brother-love of the butcher, the farmer or the baker. Rather, one appeals to their self-interest and pays them for their labor, arguing:
<blockquote>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Smith|title=The Wealth of Nations|place=London|publisher=W. Strahan and T. Cadell|year=1776|volume=1|chapter=2}}</ref></blockquote>

Supporters of this view claim that spontaneous order is superior to any order that does not allow individuals to make their own choices of what to produce, what to buy, what to sell and at what prices due to the number and complexity of the factors involved. They further believe that any attempt to implement central planning will result in more disorder, or a less efficient production and distribution of goods and services.

Critics such as political economist [[Karl Polanyi]] question whether a spontaneously ordered market can exist, completely free of distortions of political policy, claiming that even the ostensibly freest markets require a state to exercise coercive power in some areas, namely to enforce [[contract]]s, govern the formation of [[labor union]]s, spell out the rights and obligations of [[corporation]]s, shape who has standing to bring legal actions and define what constitutes an unacceptable [[conflict of interest]].<ref>[[Jacob S. Hacker|Hacker, Jacob S.]]; [[Paul Pierson|Pierson, Paul]] (2010). ''Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer – and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class''. Simon & Schuster. p. 55.</ref>

=== Supply and demand ===
{{main|Supply and demand}}
Demand for an item (such as goods or services) refers to the economic market pressure from people trying to buy it. Buyers have a maximum price they are willing to pay and sellers have a minimum price they are willing to offer their product. The point at which the supply and demand curves meet is the equilibrium price of the good and quantity demanded. Sellers willing to offer their goods at a lower price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as [[producer surplus]]. Buyers willing to pay for goods at a higher price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as [[consumer surplus]].<ref name="Judd1997">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-1889(97)00010-9| title = Computational economics and economic theory: Substitutes or complements?| journal = [[Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control]]| volume = 21| issue = 6| pages = 907–42| year = 1997| last1 = Judd | first1 = K. L.| s2cid = 55347101| url = http://www.nber.org/papers/t0208.pdf}}</ref>

The model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and consumer are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell (supply) their labor for the highest price. The consumers are businesses, which try to buy (demand) the type of labor they need at the lowest price. As more people offer their labor in that market, the equilibrium wage decreases and the equilibrium level of employment increases as the supply curve shifts to the right. The opposite happens if fewer people offer their wages in the market as the supply curve shifts to the left.<ref name="Judd1997"/>

In a free market, individuals and firms taking part in these transactions have the liberty to enter, leave and participate in the market as they so choose. Prices and quantities are allowed to adjust according to economic conditions in order to reach equilibrium and properly allocate resources. However, in many countries around the world governments seek to intervene in the free market in order to achieve certain social or political agendas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_sloman_econbus_3/18/4748/1215583.cw/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-06 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522012501/http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_sloman_econbus_3/18/4748/1215583.cw/ |archive-date=2014-05-22 }}</ref> Governments may attempt to create [[social equality]] or [[equality of outcome]] by intervening in the market through actions such as imposing a [[minimum wage]] (price floor) or erecting [[price controls]] (price ceiling). Other lesser-known goals are also pursued, such as in the United States, where the federal government subsidizes owners of fertile land to not grow crops in order to prevent the supply curve from further shifting to the right and decreasing the equilibrium price. This is done under the justification of maintaining farmers' profits; due to the relative [[Elasticity (economics)|inelasticity]] of demand for crops, increased supply would lower the price but not significantly increase quantity demanded, thus placing pressure on farmers to exit the market.<ref>{{cite news |title=Farm Program Pays $1.3 Billion to People Who Don't Farm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=2 July 2006 |access-date=3 June 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/01/AR2006070100962.html }}</ref> Those interventions are often done in the name of maintaining basic assumptions of free markets such as the idea that the costs of production must be included in the price of goods. Pollution and depletion costs are sometimes not included in the cost of production (a manufacturer that withdraws water at one location then discharges it polluted downstream, avoiding the cost of treating the water), therefore governments may opt to impose regulations in an attempt to try to internalize all of the cost of production and ultimately include them in the price of the goods.

Advocates of the free market contend that government intervention hampers economic growth by disrupting the natural allocation of resources according to supply and demand while critics of the free market contend that government intervention is sometimes necessary to protect a country's economy from better-developed and more influential economies, while providing the stability necessary for wise long-term investment. [[Milton Friedman]] pointed to failures of [[central planning]], [[price controls]] and [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned corporations]], particularly in the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] and [[Economy of China|China]]<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~esp2/WSJ%20Whitehouse%20Article.pdf Ip, Greg and Mark Whitehouse, "How Milton Friedman Changed Economics, Policy and Markets", ''Wall Street Journal Online'' (November 17, 2006).]</ref> while [[Ha-Joon Chang]] cites the examples of post-war Japan and the growth of South Korea's steel industry.<ref>"[[Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism]]", Ha-Joon Chang, Bloomsbury Press, {{ISBN|978-1596915985}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
{{See also|Criticism of capitalism}}
Critics of the free market have argued that in real world situations it has proven to be susceptible to the development of [[price fixing]] monopolies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tarbell|first=Ida|author-link=Ida Tarbell|title=The History of the Standard Oil Company|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924096224799|publisher=McClure, Phillips and Co.|year=1904}}</ref> Such reasoning has led to government intervention, e.g. the [[United States antitrust law]].

Two prominent Canadian authors argue that government at times has to intervene to ensure competition in large and important industries. [[Naomi Klein]] illustrates this roughly in her work ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' and [[John Ralston Saul]] more humorously illustrates this through various examples in ''The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World''.<ref name="The End of Globalism. Saul, John">Saul, John ''The End of Globalism''.</ref> While its supporters argue that only a free market can create healthy competition and therefore more business and reasonable prices, opponents say that a free market in its purest form may result in the opposite. According to Klein and Ralston, the merging of companies into giant corporations or the privatization of government-run industry and national assets often result in monopolies or oligopolies requiring government intervention to [[Competition law|force competition]] and reasonable prices.<ref name="The End of Globalism. Saul, John"/> Another form of market failure is [[speculation]], where transactions are made to profit from short term fluctuation, rather from the [[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]] of the companies or products. This criticism has been challenged by historians such as [[Lawrence Reed]], who argued that monopolies have historically failed to form even in the absence of antitrust law.<ref>[https://fee.org/articles/41-rockefellers-standard-oil-company-proved-that-we-needed-anti-trust-laws-to-fight-such-market-monopolies/ "Cliche #41: "Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company Proved That We Needed Anti-Trust Laws to Fight Such Market Monopolies"], ''[[The Freeman]]'', January 23, 2015. Retrieved December 20, 2016.</ref>{{unreliable source?|reason=fringe advocacy source|date=October 2021}} This is because monopolies are inherently difficult to maintain as a company that tries to maintain its monopoly by buying out new competitors, for instance, is incentivizing newcomers to enter the market in hope of a buy-out. Furthermore, according to writer Walter Lippman and economist Milton Friedman, historical analysis of the formation of monopolies reveals that, contrary to popular belief, these were the result not of unfettered market forces, but of legal privileges granted by government.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-04-25|title=Why We Need To Re-think Friedman's Ideas About Monopolies|url=https://promarket.org/2021/04/25/milton-friedman-monopoly-self-interest/|access-date=2021-09-27|website=ProMarket|language=en-US}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|reason=fringe advocacy source|date=October 2021}}

American philosopher and author [[Cornel West]] has derisively termed what he perceives as [[dogma]]tic arguments for ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies as [[market fundamentalism|free-market fundamentalism]]. West has contended that such mentality "trivializes the concern for public interest" and "makes money-driven, poll-obsessed elected officials deferential to corporate goals of profit – often at the cost of the common good".<ref>[http://www.theglobalist.com/cornel-west-democracy-matters/ "Cornel West: Democracy Matters"], ''[[The Globalist]]'', January 24, 2005.

Critics of free market economics range from those who reject markets entirely in favour of a [[planned economy]] as advocated by various [[Marxism|Marxists]] to those who wish to see market failures regulated to various degrees or supplemented by government interventions. [[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] support market roles for government such as using fiscal policy for economic stimulus when actions in the private sector lead to sub-optimal economic outcomes of [[depression (economics)|depressions]] or [[recession]]s. [[Business cycle]] is used by Keynesians to explain [[liquidity trap]]s, by which underconsumption occurs, to argue for government intervention with fiscal policy. [[David McNally (professor)|David McNally]] of the University of Houston argues in the Marxist tradition that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that [[Adam Smith]]'s moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free market he championed. According to McNally, the development of the [[market economy]] involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance. McNally also criticizes market socialists for believing in the possibility of fair markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging parasitical elements from the market economy such as [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], arguing that [[market socialism]] is an oxymoron when [[socialism]] is defined as an end to [[wage labour]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McNally|first=David|title=Against the Market: Political Economy, Market Socialism and the Marxist Critique|publisher=Verso|year=1993|isbn=978-0-86091-606-2}}</ref>

Some would argue that only one known example of a true free market exists, namely the [[black market]]. The black market is under constant threat by the [[police]], but under no circumstances do the police regulate the substances that are being created. The black market produces wholly unregulated goods and are purchased and consumed unregulated. That is to say, anyone can produce anything at any time and anyone can purchase anything available at any time. The alternative view is that the black market is not a free market at all since high prices and [[natural monopolies]] are often enforced through murder, theft and destruction. Black markets can only exist peripheral to regulated markets where laws are being regularly enforced.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}
