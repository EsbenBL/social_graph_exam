'''Bertil Gotthard Ohlin''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈbæ̌ʈːɪl ʊˈliːn|lang}}) (23 April 1899 – 3 August 1979) was a [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[economist]] and [[politician]]. He was a professor of [[economics]] at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] from 1929 to 1965. He was also leader of the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|People's Party]], a [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] party which at the time was the largest party in opposition to the governing [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]], from 1944 to 1967. He served briefly as [[Minister for Trade (Sweden)|Minister for Trade]] from 1944 to 1945 in the Swedish [[Third cabinet of Per Albin Hansson|coalition government during World War II]]. He was President of the [[Nordic Council]] in 1959 and 1964.

Ohlin's name lives on in one of the standard [[mathematical model]]s of international [[free trade]], the [[Heckscher–Ohlin model]], which he developed together with [[Eli Heckscher]]. He was jointly awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1977 together with the British economist [[James Meade]] "for their pathbreaking contribution to the theory of [[international trade]] and international [[capital movement]]s".

== Biography ==
Having received his B.A. from [[Lund University]] 1917 and his MSc. from [[Stockholm School of Economics]] in 1919. He obtained an M.A. from [[Harvard University]] in 1923 and his doctorate from [[Stockholm University]] in 1924. In 1925 he became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1929 he debated with [[John Maynard Keynes]], contradicting the latter's view on the consequences of the heavy war [[World War I reparations|reparations]] payments imposed on [[Germany]]. (Keynes predicted a war caused by the burden of [[debt]], Ohlin thought that [[Germany]] could afford the reparations.) The debate was important in the modern theory of [[unilateral]] [[International Payment and Exchange|international payments]].

In 1930 Ohlin succeeded [[Eli Heckscher]], his teacher, as a professor of [[economics]], at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]]. In 1933 Ohlin published a work that made him world-renowned, ''Interregional and International Trade''. In this Ohlin built an economic theory of international trade from earlier work by Heckscher and his own doctoral thesis. It is now known as the [[Heckscher–Ohlin model]], one of the standard model economists use to debate [[free trade|trade theory]].

The model was a break-through because it showed how [[comparative advantage]] might relate to general features of a country's [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and labor, and how these features might change through time. The model provided a basis for later work on the effects of protection on [[Inflation|real]] wages, and has been fruitful in producing predictions and analysis; Ohlin himself used the model to derive the [[Heckscher–Ohlin theorem]], that nations would specialize in industries most able to utilize their mix of national resources efficiently.  Today, the theory has been largely disproved, yet it is still a useful framework by which to understand international trade.

In 1937, Ohlin spent half a year at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], as a visiting professor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/32721/bertilohlinscont1305brem.pdf?sequence=2|title=BERTH OHLIN'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMIC THEORY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vz90T4yb4HoC&pg=PA32|title=Bertil Ohlin: A Centennial Celebration, 1899–1999|last=Findlay|first=Ronald|last2=Jonung|first2=Lars|last3=Lundahl|first3=Mats|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262062282|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXI0AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA104|title=Michał Kalecki: An Intellectual Biography: Volume I Rendezvous in Cambridge 1899–1939|last=Toporowski|first=J.|date=2013-07-29|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137315397|language=en}}</ref>

Later, Ohlin and other members of the "[[Stockholm school]]" extended [[Knut Wicksell]]'s economic analysis to produce a theory of the macroeconomy anticipating [[Keynesianism]].

Ohlin was party leader of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] from 1944 to 1967, the main opposition party to the [[Socialdemokratiska arbetarpartiet|Social Democrat]] Governments of the era, and from '44 to '45 was ''minister of commerce'' in the wartime government. His daughter [[Anne Wibble]], representing the same party, served as Minister of Finance from 1991 to 1994.

In 2009, a street adjacent to the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] was named after Ohlin: "Bertil Ohlins Gata".

== Heckscher–Ohlin theorem ==
{{Main|Heckscher–Ohlin theorem}}
The Heckscher–Ohlin Theorem, which is concluded from the [[Heckscher–Ohlin model]] of international trade, states: trade between countries is in proportion to their relative amounts of capital and labor. In countries with an abundance of capital, wage rates tend to be high; therefore, labor-intensive products, e.g. textiles, simple electronics, etc., are more costly to produce internally. In contrast, capital-intensive products, e.g. automobiles, chemicals, etc., are less costly to produce internally. Countries with large amounts of capital will export capital-intensive products and import labor-intensive products with the proceeds. Countries with high amounts of labor will do the reverse.

The following conditions must be true:
* The major factors of production, namely labor and capital, are not available in the same proportion in both countries.
* The two goods produced either require more capital or more labor.
* Labor and capital do not move between the two countries.
* There are no costs associated with transporting the goods between countries.
* The citizens of the two trading countries have the same needs.

The theory does not depend on total amounts of capital or labor, but on the amounts per worker. This allows small countries to trade with large countries by specializing in production of products that use the factors which are more available than its trading partner. The key assumption is that capital and labor are not available in the same proportions in the two countries. That leads to specialization, which in turn benefits the country's economic welfare. The greater the difference between the two countries, the greater the gain from specialization.

[[Wassily Leontief]] made a study of the theory that seemed to invalidate it. He noted that the United States had a lot of capital; therefore, it should export capital-intensive products and import labor-intensive products. Instead, he found that it exported products that used more labor than the products it imported. This finding is known as the [[Leontief paradox]].
