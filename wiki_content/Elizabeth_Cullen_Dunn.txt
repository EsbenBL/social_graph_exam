'''Elizabeth Cullen Dunn''' (born 1968) is an American political anthropologist and geographer.  Her work focuses on responses to catastrophic social change, particularly in the post-Soviet world.

==Education==
Dunn holds a Ph.D. in anthropology from [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1998).

==Scholarship==
Dunn's work investigates governance, the state, and the ways in which these processes strive to produce governable subjects. She investigates these topics by examining the ways they are manifest in people's lived experiences. Though all Dunn's work deals with these topics, thematically, it can be divided into three bodies of literature: on foreign direct investment (FDI) in [[Poland]] and the former Eastern Bloc more broadly; on global food safety regulation; and, most recently, on forced migration.

==Career==
In 2000, Dunn accepted a joint appointment in the Department of Geography and the Program in International Affairs at the [[University of Colorado]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], CO. In 2014, Dunn moved to the Departments of Geography and International Studies at Indiana University, [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], later becoming Professor.
