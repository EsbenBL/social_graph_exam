'''Isaak Borisovich Russman''' ({{lang-ru|Исаак Борисович Руссман}}; 7 March 1938 &ndash; 11 July 2005) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[mathematician]] and [[economist]]. He studied and worked at [[Voronezh State University]].

Isaak Borisovich Russman was born on March 7, 1938 in [[Voronezh]]. Although his childhood dream was studying [[astronomy]], in 1955 he entered Voronezh State University where he studied in the [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]] department.  Starting in 1969 and until the end of his life, Russman conducted research in [[operations research]] at the same institution where he had studied.

Russman taught [[discrete mathematics]], the [[theory of algorithms]] and [[mathematical logic]], [[probability theory]], economic [[cybernetics]], and [[systems analysis]].

Russman conducted research on topics related to simulation-targeted systems (economic, social, institutional), quality assessment, and building [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] models. He is famous for creating the concept "difficulty in achieving the objectives", a concept which is used to assess the value of a certain specified requirement. This approach was usefully applied to models of control and management of organizational systems and [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] [[optimization]] models.
