'''Harold Hotelling''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|oʊ|t|əl|ɪ|ŋ}}; September 29, 1895 – December 26, 1973) was an American [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[statistics|statistician]] and an influential [[economics|economic]] theorist, known for [[Hotelling's law]], [[Hotelling's lemma]], and [[Hotelling's rule]] in economics, as well as [[Hotelling's T-squared distribution]] in statistics.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=k2zklGOBRDwC&pg=PA246&dq=harold+hotelling+encyclopedia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TlRuVeqnJ4mcsAWc7YHoAQ&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=harold%20hotelling&f=false Dodge, Y. (2008). The concise encyclopedia of statistics, Springer]</ref> He also developed and named the [[principal component analysis]] method widely used in finance, statistics and computer science.

He was Associate Professor of Mathematics at [[Stanford University]] from 1927 until 1931, a member of the faculty of [[Columbia University]] from 1931 until 1946, and a Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] from 1946 until his death. A street in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] bears his name. In 1972, he received the [[North Carolina Award]] for contributions to science.

== Statistics ==
Hotelling is known to statisticians because of [[Hotelling's T-squared distribution]] which is a generalization of the [[Student's t-distribution]] in multivariate setting, and its use in statistical [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] and confidence regions. He also introduced [[canonical correlation]] analysis.

At the beginning of his statistical career Hotelling came under the influence of [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]], whose ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'' had "revolutionary importance", according to Hotelling's review. Hotelling was able to maintain professional relations with Fisher, despite the latter's temper tantrums and polemics. Hotelling suggested that Fisher use the English word "[[cumulant]]s" for [[T. N. Thiele|Thiele]]'s Danish "semi-invariants". Fisher's emphasis on the sampling distribution of a statistic was extended by [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]] with greater precision and wider applications, which Hotelling recognized. Hotelling sponsored refugees from European anti-semitism and Nazism, welcoming [[Henry Mann]] and [[Abraham Wald]] to his research group at Columbia. While at Hotelling's group, Wald developed [[sequential analysis]] and [[statistical decision theory]], which Hotelling described as "pragmatism in action".

In the United States, Hotelling is known for his leadership of the statistics profession, in particular for his vision of a statistics department at a university, which convinced many universities to start statistics departments. Hotelling was known for his leadership of departments at [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of North Carolina]].

== Economics ==
Hotelling has a crucial place in the growth of mathematical economics; several areas of active research were influenced by his economics papers. While at the [[University of Washington]], he was encouraged to switch from pure mathematics toward mathematical economics by the famous mathematician [[Eric Temple Bell]]. Later, at [[Columbia University]] (where during 1933-34 he taught [[Milton Friedman]] statistics) in the '40s, Hotelling in turn encouraged young [[Kenneth Arrow]] to switch from mathematics and statistics applied to actuarial studies towards more general applications of mathematics in general economic theory. Hotelling is the [[eponym]] of [[Hotelling's law]], [[Hotelling's lemma]], and [[Hotelling's rule]] in [[economics]].

Hotelling was influenced by the writing of [[Henry George]] and was an editorial adviser for the [[Georgist]] journal [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology|AJES]]<ref>Turgeon, Lynn. Bastard Keynesianism : the evolution of economic thinking and policymaking since World War II. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1997</ref> Mason Gaffney claims that Hotelling kept his lifelong beliefs about land and tax reform secret because he feared ridicule.<ref>Gaffney, Mason. "Warm Memories of Bill Vickrey". Land & Liberty. http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/gaffney-mason_warm-memories-of-bill-vickrey-1997.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116103120/http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/gaffney-mason_warm-memories-of-bill-vickrey-1997.htm |date=2016-11-16 }}</ref>

=== Spatial economics ===
{{main|Hotelling's Law}}
One of Hotelling's most important contributions to economics was his conception of “[[spatial economics]]” in his 1929 article.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hotelling | first1 = Harold | year = 1929 | title = Stability in Competition | journal = Economic Journal | volume = 39 | issue = 153| pages = 41–57 | doi=10.2307/2224214| jstor = 2224214 }}</ref>  Space was not just a barrier to moving goods around, but rather a field upon which competitors jostled to be nearest to their customers.<ref>Palda, Filip (2013). The Apprentice Economist: Seven Steps to Mastery. Toronto. Cooper-Wolfling Press.</ref>

Hotelling considers a situation in which there are two sellers at point A and B in a [[line segment]] of size l. The buyers are [[uniform distribution (continuous)|distributed uniformly]] in this line segment and carry the merchandise to their home at cost c. Let p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> be the prices charged by A and B, and let the line segment be divided in 3 parts of size a, x+y and b, where x+y is the size of the segment between A and B, ''a'' the portion of segment to the left of A and ''b'' the portion of segment to the right of B. Therefore, a+x+y+b=l. Since the product being sold is a [[commodity]], the point of indifference to buying is given by p<sub>1</sub>+cx=p<sub>2</sub>+cy. Solving for x and y yields:

:<math>x=\frac{1}{2}\left( l-a-b+\frac{p_{2}-p_{1}}{c} \right)</math>

:<math>y=\frac{1}{2}\left( l-a-b+\frac{p_{1}-p_{2}}{c} \right)</math>

Let q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> indicate the quantities sold by A and B. The sellers profit are:

:<math>\pi_{1}=p_{1}q_{1}=p_{1}\left( a+x \right)=\frac{1}{2}\left( l+a-b \right)p_{1}-\frac{p_{1}^{2}}{2c}+\frac{p_{1}p_{2}}{2c}</math>

:<math>\pi_{2}=p_{2}q_{2}=p_{2}\left( b+y \right)=\frac{1}{2}\left( l-a+b \right)p_{2}-\frac{p_{2}^{2}}{2c}+\frac{p_{1}p_{2}}{2c}</math>

By imposing [[profit maximization]]:

:<math>\frac{\partial \pi_{1}}{\partial p_{1}}=\frac{1}{2}\left( l+a-b \right)-\frac{p_{1}}{c}+\frac{p_{2}}{2c}=0</math>

:<math>\frac{\partial \pi_{2}}{\partial p_{2}}=\frac{1}{2}\left( l+a-b \right)-\frac{p_{1}}{2c}+\frac{p_{2}}{c}=0</math>

Hotelling obtains the [[economic equilibrium]]. Hotelling argues this equilibrium is [[Lyapunov stability|stable]] even though the sellers may try to establish a price [[cartel]].

=== Market socialism and Georgism ===
As an extension of his research in spatial economics, Hotelling realized that it would be possible and socially optimal to finance investment in public goods through a [[Georgist]] [[land value tax]] and then provide such goods and services to the public at marginal cost (in many cases for free). This is an early expression of the [[Henry George theorem]] that [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and others expanded upon. Hotelling pointed out that when local public goods like roads and trains become congested, users create an additional marginal cost of excluding others. Hotelling became an early advocate of Georgist [[congestion pricing]] and stated that the purpose of this unique type of [[toll fee]] was in no way to recoup investment costs, but was instead a way of changing behavior and compensating those who are excluded. Hotelling describes how human attention is also in limited supply at any given time and place, which produces a rental value; he concludes that billboards could be regulated or taxed on similar grounds as other scarcity rents. Hotelling reasoned that rent and taxation were analogous, the public and private versions of a similar thing. Therefore, the social optimum would be to put taxes directly on rent.<ref name="jstor.org">{{cite journal | last1 = Hotelling | first1 = Harold | year = 1938 | title = The General Welfare in Relation to Problems of Taxation and of Railway and Utility Rates | journal = Econometrica | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 242–269 | jstor=1907054|doi = 10.2307/1907054}}</ref> [[Kenneth Arrow]] described this as [[market socialism]], but [[Mason Gaffney]] points out that it is actually Georgism.<ref>Gaffney, Mason, and Fred Harrison. The corruption of economics. London: Shepheard-Walwyn in association with Centre for Incentive Taxation, 2006</ref> Hotelling added the following comment about the ethics of Georgist [[value capture]]: "The proposition that there is no ethical objection to the confiscation of the site value of land by taxation, if and when the nonlandowning classes can get the power to do so, has been ably defended by [the Georgist] [[Harry Gunnison Brown|H. G. Brown]]."<ref name="jstor.org"/>

=== Non-convexities ===
Hotelling made pioneering studies of [[non-convexity in economics]]. In [[economics]], ''non-convexity'' refers to violations of the [[convexity in economics|convexity assumptions of elementary economics]]. Basic economics textbooks concentrate on consumers with [[convex preferences]] and convex [[budget set]]s and on producers with convex [[production set]]s; for convex models, the predicted economic behavior is well understood.<ref name="MCNC"/><ref name="GreenHeller" >{{cite book|first1=Jerry|last1=Green|first2=Walter&nbsp;P.|last2=Heller|chapter=1 Mathematical&nbsp;analysis and&nbsp;convexity with applications to economics|pages=15–52|doi=10.1016/S1573-4382(81)01005-9|title=Handbook of mathematical&nbsp;economics, Volume&nbsp;'''I'''|editor1-link=Kenneth Arrow |editor1-first=Kenneth&nbsp;Joseph|editor1-last=Arrow|editor2-first=Michael&nbsp;D<!-- . -->|editor2-last=Intriligator|series=Handbooks in economics|volume=1|publisher=North-Holland Publishing&nbsp;Co.|location=Amsterdam|year=1981|isbn=978-0-444-86126-9|mr=634800}}</ref>  When convexity assumptions are violated, then many of the good properties of competitive markets need not hold: Thus, non-convexity is associated with [[market failure]]s,<ref name="MarketFailure"/><ref name="SalanieDefinition" >{{harvtxt|Salanié|2000|p=36|}}</ref> where [[supply and demand]] differ or where [[market equilibrium|market equilibria]] can be [[Pareto efficiency|inefficient]].<ref name="MCNC"/><ref name="SalanieDefinition"/><ref name="Laffont"/><ref name="Starrett"/><ref name="Baumol"/><ref name="GuesnerieNonConvex"/>

In "[[oligopoly|oligopolies]]" (markets dominated by a few producers<!-- with increasing [[returns to&nbsp;scale]] -->), especially in "[[monopoly|monopolies]]" (markets dominated by one&nbsp;producer), non-convexities remain important.<ref name="GuesnerieNonConvex" ><!-- Guenserie discusses public economies a bit later, but he introduces "indivisibilities" on page 1, and economists would recognize that this synopsis is faithful and accessible to the public, imho -->Page 1: {{cite journal|last=Guesnerie|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Guesnerie|title=Pareto optimality in non-convex economies|journal=Econometrica|volume=43|issue=1|year=1975|pages=1–29|jstor=1913410|doi=10.2307/1913410|mr=443877}} ({{cite journal<!-- |last=Guesnerie|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Guesnerie -->|title=Errata<!-- : "Pareto optimality in non-convex economies" (''Econometrica'' 43 (1975), 1–29) -->|journal=Econometrica |volume=43|pages=1010|year=1975|number=5–6|doi=10.2307/1911353|mr=443878 | jstor = 1911353 | last1 = Guesnerie | first1 = Roger}})</ref> Concerns with large producers exploiting market power initiated the literature on non-convex sets, when [[Piero Sraffa]] wrote about firms with increasing [[returns to scale]] in&nbsp;1926,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sraffa|first=Piero|author-link=Piero Sraffa|year=1926|title=The Laws of returns under competitive conditions|journal=Economic Journal|volume=36|number=144|pages=535–550|jstor=2959866|doi=10.2307/2959866|s2cid=6458099|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72c06b4673f6fd673f7763f373efb531f3484014}}</ref> after which Hotelling wrote about [[marginal&nbsp;cost pricing]] in&nbsp;1938.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Harold|last=Hotelling|title=The General welfare in relation to problems of taxation and of railway and utility rates|journal=Econometrica|volume=6|number=3|date=July 1938|pages=242–269|jstor=1907054|doi = 10.2307/1907054}}</ref> Both Sraffa and Hotelling illuminated the [[market power]] of producers without competitors, clearly stimulating a literature on the supply-side of the economy.<ref>Pages 5–7: {{cite book|last=Quinzii|first=Martine|author-link= Martine Quinzii |title=Increasing returns and efficiency|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|edition=Revised translation of (1988) ''Rendements croissants et efficacité economique''.

==== Consumers with non-convex preferences ====
When the consumer's preference set is non-convex, then (for some prices) the consumer's demand is not [[connected space|connected]]. A disconnected demand implies some discontinuous behavior by the consumer as discussed by Hotelling:
<blockquote>If indifference curves for purchases be thought of as possessing a wavy character, convex to the origin in some regions and concave in others, we are forced to the conclusion that it is only the portions convex to the origin that can be regarded as possessing any importance, since the others are essentially unobservable. They can be detected only by the discontinuities that may occur in demand with variation in price-ratios, leading to an abrupt jumping of a point of tangency across a chasm when the straight line is rotated. But, while such discontinuities may reveal the existence of chasms, they can never measure their depth. The concave portions of the indifference curves and their many-dimensional generalizations, if they exist, must forever remain in unmeasurable obscurity.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hotelling|1935|p=74}}:

Following Hotelling's pioneering research on non-convexities in economics, research in economics has recognized non-convexity in new areas of economics. In these areas, non-convexity is associated with [[market failure]]s, where any [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] need not be [[Pareto efficiency|efficient]] or where no equilibrium exists because [[supply and demand]] differ.<ref name="MCNC"/><ref name="SalanieDefinition"/><ref name="Laffont"/><ref name="Starrett"/><ref name="Baumol"/><ref name="GuesnerieNonConvex"/> Non-convex sets arise also with [[environmental economics|environmental goods]] and other [[externality|externalities]],<ref name="Starrett">{{cite journal|mr=449575|last=Starrett|first=David&nbsp;A. |title=Fundamental nonconvexities in the theory of externalities|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=4 |year=1972|number=2|pages=180–199|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(72)90148-2}}</ref><ref name="Baumol" >Pages 106, 110–137, 172, and 248: {{cite book|title=The Theory of environmental policy|edition=Second|first1=William&nbsp;J.|last1=Baumol|author-link1=William Baumol|last2=Oates|first2=Wallace&nbsp;E.|isbn=978-0-521-31112-0|doi=10.2277/0521311128|year=1988|pages=x+299|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|author3=with contributions by V.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Bawa and David&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Bradford|chapter=8 Detrimental externalities and nonconvexities in the production set}}</ref> and with [[market failure]]s,<ref name="MarketFailure" >{{cite book|last=Salanié|first=Bernard|chapter=7 Nonconvexities <!-- Not "Non–convexities"  -->|title=Microeconomics of market failures|edition=English translation of the (1998) French ''Microéconomie: Les défaillances du&nbsp;marché'' (Economica, Paris)|year=2000|publisher=MIT&nbsp;Press|location=Cambridge,&nbsp;MA|pages=107–125|isbn=978-0-262-19443-3}}</ref> and [[public economics]].<ref name="Laffont" >Pages&nbsp;63–65: {{cite book|last=Laffont|first=Jean-Jacques|author-link=Jean-Jacques Laffont|year=1988|chapter=3 Nonconvexities <!-- Not "Non–convexities"  -->|title=Fundamentals of public economics|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5MnAQAAIAAJ&q=editions:ISBN+0-262-12127-1|publisher=MIT|isbn=978-0-262-12127-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofpu0000laff}}</ref><ref name="StarrettBook">Starrett discusses non-convexities in his textbook on [[public economics]] (pages&nbsp;33,&nbsp;43,&nbsp;48,&nbsp;56,&nbsp;70–72,&nbsp;82,&nbsp;147, and&nbsp;234–236): {{cite book|last=Starrett|first=David&nbsp;A.|title=Foundations of public economics|series=Cambridge economic handbooks|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|url=https://archive.org/details/foundationsofpub0000star|url-access=registration|quote=nonconvex OR nonconvexities.|isbn=978-0-521-34801-0}}</ref>
