==Biography==
[[File:Al-RaziInGerardusCremonensis1250.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Depiction of al-Razi in a 13th-century manuscript of a work by [[Gerard of Cremona]]]]
Al-Razi was born in the city of [[Rey, Iran|Ray]] (modern Rey, also the origin of his [[nisba (onomastics)|name]] "al-Razi"),<ref>{{harvnb|Adamson|2021}}.</ref> situated on the [[silk road|Great Silk Road]] that for centuries facilitated trade and cultural exchanges between East and West. It is located on the southern slopes of the [[Alborz]] mountain range situated near [[Tehran]], Iran.

In his youth, al-Razi moved to [[Baghdad]] where he studied and practiced at the local [[bimaristan]] (hospital). Later, he was invited back to Rey by [[Mansur ibn Ishaq]], then the governor of Rey, and became a bimaristan's head.<ref name="ENW2" /> He dedicated two books on medicine to Mansur ibn Ishaq, ''The Spiritual Physic'' and ''Al-Mansūrī on Medicine''.<ref name="ENW2" /><ref>{{Cite web

}}</ref> Because of his newly acquired popularity as physician, al-Razi was invited to Baghdad where he assumed the responsibilities of a director in a new hospital named after its founder [[al-Muʿtaḍid]] (d. 902 CE).<ref name="ENW2" /> Under the reign of Al-Mutadid's son, [[Al-Muktafi]] (r. 902-908) al-Razi was commissioned to build a new hospital, which should be the largest of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. To pick the future hospital's location, al-Razi adopted what is nowadays known as an [[evidence-based]] approach suggesting having fresh meat hung in various places throughout the city and to build the hospital where meat took longest to rot.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc= 3644752 | pmid=23661862 | doi=10.4103/0257-7941.107357 | volume=31 | issue=4 | title=Rhazes' concepts and manuscripts on nutrition in treatment and health care |vauthors=Nikaein F, Zargaran A, Mehdizadeh A | journal=Anc Sci Life | pages=160–3| year=2012 }}</ref>

He spent the last years of his life in his native Rey suffering from [[glaucoma]]. His eye affliction started with cataracts and ended in total blindness.<ref>Magner, Lois N.

Al-Razi then asked him how many layers does the [[Human eye|eye]] contain and when he was unable to receive an answer, he declined the treatment stating "my eyes will not be treated by one who does not know the basics of its anatomy".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/saab/S16R27/html-640/003-002.html |title=Saab Medical Library – كتاب في الجدري و الحصبة – American University of Beirut |publisher=Ddc.aub.edu.lb |date=1 June 2003 |access-date=15 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425001329/http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/saab/S16R27/html-640/003-002.html |archive-date=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The lectures of al-Razi attracted many students. As [[Ibn al-Nadim]] relates in ''[[Ibn al-Nadim#Fihrist|Fihrist]]'', al-Razi was considered a ''[[shaikh]]'', an honorary title given to one entitled to teach and surrounded by several circles of students. When someone raised a question, it was passed on to students of the 'first circle'; if they did not know the answer, it was passed on to those of the 'second circle', and so on. When all students would fail to answer, al-Razi himself would consider the query. Al-Razi was a generous person by nature, with a considerate attitude towards his patients. He was charitable to the poor, treated them without payment in any form, and wrote for them a treatise ''Man La Yaḥḍuruhu al-Ṭabīb'', or ''Who Has No Physician to Attend Him'', with medical advice.<ref>Porter, Roy. ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity''. New York: W. W. Norton, 1997, p. 97.</ref> One former pupil from [[Tabaristan]] came to look after him, but as [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|al-Biruni]] wrote, al-Razi rewarded him for his intentions and sent him back home, proclaiming that his final days were approaching.<ref name="Brilliant Biruni">Kamiar, Mohammad.

[[Ibn al-Nadim]] recorded an account by al-Razi of a [[China|Chinese]] student who copied down all of [[Galen]]'s works in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as al-Razi read them to him out loud after the student learned fluent Arabic in 5 months and attended al-Razi's lectures.<ref name="NeedhamWang1954">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Needham|author2=Ling Wang|title=中國科學技術史|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNXZGQVdz_gC&pg=PA219|year=1954|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-05799-8|pages=219–}}</ref><ref name="Gernet1996">{{cite book|author=Jacques Gernet|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofchinese00gern|url-access=registration|date=31 May 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49781-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofchinese00gern/page/34 34]–}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physique48.org/serv/razi.htm|title=الرازي|first=فيزياء|last=غليزان|access-date=24 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224956/http://www.physique48.org/serv/razi.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nooonbooks.com/media/downloadable/files/links/2/5/pages/25058/OPS/Text/chapter-012.xml|title=قلم لنكبرده ولساكسه , قلم الصين|access-date=2 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223624/http://www.nooonbooks.com/media/downloadable/files/links/2/5/pages/25058/OPS/Text/chapter-012.xml|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After his death, his fame spread beyond the Middle East to Medieval Europe, and lived on. In an undated catalog of the library at [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough Abbey]], most likely from the 14th century, al-Razi is listed as a part author of ten books on medicine.<ref>Gunton, Simon.

===Psychology and psychotherapy===
Al-Razi was one of the world's first great medical experts. He is considered the father of psychology and psychotherapy.<ref name="Claude Philips">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAO0CgAAQBAJ&q=al+razi+father+of+ophthalmology&pg=PA111|title=No Wonder You Wonder!: Great Inventions and Scientific Mysteries|last=Phipps|first=Claude|date=2015-10-05|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319216805|language=en|page=111}}</ref>

===Smallpox vs. measles===
<!-- Commented out: [[File:Al-Razi Treatise Smallpox prevention.jpg|thumb|left|Al-Razi's treatise on Smallpox prevention.]] -->Al-Razi wrote:

<blockquote>Smallpox appears when blood "boils" and is infected, resulting in vapours being expelled. Thus juvenile blood (which looks like wet extracts appearing on the skin) is being transformed into richer blood, having the color of mature wine. At this stage, smallpox shows up essentially as "bubbles found in wine" (as blisters)... this disease can also occur at other times (meaning: not only during childhood). The best thing to do during this first stage is to keep away from it, otherwise this disease might turn into an epidemic.</blockquote>

This diagnosis is acknowledged by the ''[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1911), which states: "The most trustworthy statements as to the early existence of the disease are found in an account by the 9th-century Persian physician Rhazes, by whom its symptoms were clearly described, its pathology explained by a humoral or [[fermentation theory]], and directions given for its treatment."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rhazes-His Life and Contributions to the Field of Dermatology.|journal=JAMA Dermatology|volume=153|issue=1|pages=70|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.0144|pmid=28114524|year=2017|last1=Hashempur|first1=Mohammad Hashem|last2=Hashempour|first2=Mohammad Mahdi|last3=Mosavat|first3=Seyed Hamdollah|last4=Heydari|first4=Mojtaba}}</ref>

Al-Razi's book ''al-Judari wa al-Hasbah'' (''On Smallpox and Measles'') was the first book describing [[smallpox]] and [[measles]] as distinct diseases.<ref>{{cite book| author=Fuat Sezgin| title=Ar-Razi.

III: Medizin – Pharmazie – Zoologie – Tierheilkunde = History of the Arabic literature Vol. III: Medicine – Pharmacology – Veterinary Medicine| date=1970| publisher=E. J. Brill| location=Leiden| pages=276, 283|author-link = Fuat Sezgin}}</ref> It was translated more than a dozen times into [[Latin]] and other European languages. Its lack of dogmatism and its [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] reliance on clinical observation show al-Razi's medical methods. For example, he wrote:<blockquote>The eruption of smallpox is preceded by a continued fever, pain in the back, itching in the nose and nightmares during sleep. These are the more acute symptoms of its approach together with a noticeable pain in the back accompanied by fever and an itching felt by the patient all over his body. A swelling of the face appears, which comes and goes, and one notices an overall inflammatory color noticeable as a strong redness on both cheeks and around both eyes. One experiences a heaviness of the whole body and great restlessness, which expresses itself as a lot of stretching and yawning. There is a pain in the throat and chest and one finds it difficult to breathe and cough. Additional symptoms are: dryness of breath, thick spittle, hoarseness of the voice, pain and heaviness of the head, restlessness, nausea and anxiety. (Note the difference: restlessness, nausea and anxiety occur more frequently with "measles" than with smallpox. At the other hand, pain in the back is more apparent with smallpox than with measles). Altogether one experiences heat over the whole body, one has an inflamed colon and one shows an overall shining redness, with a very pronounced redness of the gums. (Rhazes, Encyclopaedia of Medicine)</blockquote>

=== Meningitis ===
Al-Razi compared the outcome of patients with [[meningitis]] treated with [[blood-letting]] with the outcome of those treated without it to see if blood-letting could help.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK66204/|title=Testing Treatments: Better Research for Better Healthcare|last1=Evans|first1=Imogen|last2=Thornton|first2=Hazel|last3=Chalmers|first3=Iain|last4=Glasziou|first4=Paul|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Pinter & Martin|isbn=9781905177486|edition=2nd|location=London|pmid=22171402}}</ref>

===Pharmacy===
Al-Razi contributed in many ways to the early practice of [[pharmacy]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.islamicmedicine.org/alrazi3.htm | title=The valuable contributions of Al-Razi (Rhazes) in the history of pharmacy during the middle ages | access-date=16 June 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204104627/http://www.islamicmedicine.org/alrazi3.htm | archive-date=4 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> by compiling texts, in which he introduces the use of "[[mercury (element)|mercurial]] ointments" and his development of apparatus such as mortars, flasks, spatulas and phials, which were used in pharmacies until the early twentieth century.{{cn|date=September 2021}}

===Ethics of medicine===
On a professional level, al-Razi introduced many practical, progressive, medical and psychological ideas. He attacked [[charlatan]]s and fake doctors who roamed the cities and countryside selling their [[Patent medicine|nostrums]] and "cures". At the same time, he warned that even highly educated doctors did not have the answers to all medical problems and could not cure all sicknesses or heal every disease, which was humanly speaking impossible. To become more useful in their services and truer to their calling, al-Razi advised practitioners to keep up with advanced knowledge by continually studying medical books and exposing themselves to new information. He made a distinction between curable and incurable diseases. Pertaining to the latter, he commented that in the case of advanced cases of cancer and [[leprosy]] the physician should not be blamed when he could not cure them. To add a humorous note, al-Razi felt great pity for physicians who took care for the well being of princes, nobility, and women, because they did not obey the doctor's orders to restrict their diet or get medical treatment, thus making it most difficult being their physician.

He also wrote the following on [[medical ethics]]:
{{quote|sign=|source=|The doctor's aim is to do good, even to our enemies, so much more to our friends, and my profession forbids us to do harm to our kindred, as it is instituted for the benefit and welfare of the human race, and God imposed on physicians the oath not to compose mortiferous remedies.<ref>[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=570 Islamic Science, the Scholar and Ethics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922222605/http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=570 |date=22 September 2007 }}, Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.</ref>}}

}}</ref> Because of this book alone, many scholars consider al-Razi the greatest medical doctor of the [[Middle Ages]].

The ''al-Hawi'' is not a formal medical encyclopedia, but a posthumous compilation of al-Razi's working notebooks, which included knowledge gathered from other books as well as original observations on diseases and therapies, based on his own clinical experience. It is significant since it contains a celebrated monograph on smallpox, the earliest one known. It was translated into Latin in 1279 by [[Faraj ben Salim]], a physician of Sicilian-Jewish origin employed by [[Charles of Anjou]], and after which it had a considerable influence in Europe.

The ''al-Hawi'' also criticized the views of [[Galen]], after al-Razi had observed many clinical cases which did not follow Galen's descriptions of fevers. For example, he stated that Galen's descriptions of [[urinary]] [[ailment]]s were inaccurate as he had only seen three cases, while al-Razi had studied hundreds of such cases in [[Bimaristan|hospitals]] of [[Baghdad]] and Rey.<ref>Emilie Savage-Smith (1996), "Medicine", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 3, pp. 903–962 [917]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.</ref>

;''For One Who Has No Physician to Attend Him'' (''Man la Yahduruhu Al-Tabib'') (''من لا يحضره الطبيب'')—A medical adviser for the general public

Al-Razi was possibly the first Persian doctor to deliberately write a home medical manual ([[Home remedy|remedial]]) directed at the general public. He dedicated it to the poor, the traveler, and the ordinary citizen who could consult it for treatment of common ailments when a doctor was not available. This book is of special interest to the history of pharmacy since similar books were very popular until the 20th century. Al-Razi described in its 36 chapters, diets and drug components that can be found in either an apothecary, a market place, in well-equipped kitchens, or and in military camps. Thus, every intelligent person could follow its instructions and prepare the proper recipes with good results.

Some of the illnesses treated were headaches, colds, coughing, melancholy and diseases of the eye, ear, and stomach. For example, he prescribed for a feverish headache: " 2 parts of ''duhn'' (oily extract) of [[rose]], to be mixed with 1 part of vinegar, in which a piece of [[linen]] cloth is dipped and compressed on the forehead". He recommended as a [[laxative]], " 7 [[Dram (unit)|drams]] of dried [[violet (plant)|violet]] flowers with 20 pears, [[Maceration (food)|macerated]] and well mixed, then strained. Add to this [[filtrate]], 20 drams of sugar for a drink. In cases of melancholy, he invariably recommended prescriptions, which included either [[poppy|poppies]] or its juice ([[opium]]), ''[[Cuscuta epithymum]]'' (clover dodder) or both. For an eye-remedy, he advised [[myrrh]], [[saffron]], and [[frankincense]], 2 drams each, to be mixed with 1 dram of [[yellow arsenic]] formed into [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]]. Each tablet was to be dissolved in a sufficient quantity of [[coriander water]] and used as eye drops.

;''Doubts About Galen'' (''Shukuk 'ala alinusor'')

In his book ''Doubts about Galen'', al-Razi rejects several claims made by the Greek physician, as far as the alleged superiority of the [[Greek language]] and many of his [[cosmology|cosmological]] and medical views. He links medicine with philosophy, and states that sound practice demands independent thinking. He reports that Galen's descriptions do not agree with his own clinical observations regarding the run of a fever. And in some cases he finds that his clinical experience exceeds Galen's.

He criticized Galen's theory that the body possessed four separate "[[Humorism|humors]]" (liquid substances), whose balance are the key to health and a natural body-temperature. A sure way to upset such a system was to insert a liquid with a different temperature into the body resulting in an increase or decrease of bodily heat, which resembled the temperature of that particular fluid. Al-Razi noted that a warm drink would heat up the body to a degree much higher than its own natural temperature. Thus the drink would trigger a response from the body, rather than transferring only its own warmth or coldness to it. (''Cf.'' I. E. Goodman)

This line of criticism essentially had the potential to completely refute Galen's theory of humors, as well as Aristotle's theory of the [[Classical elements|four elements]], on which it was grounded. Al-Razi's own alchemical experiments suggested other qualities of matter, such as "oiliness" and "sulphurousness", or [[inflammability]] and [[salinity]], which were not readily explained by the traditional fire, water, earth, and air division of elements.

Al-Razi's challenge to the current fundamentals of medical theory was quite controversial. Many accused him of ignorance and arrogance, even though he repeatedly expressed his praise and gratitude to Galen for his contributions and labors, saying:

<blockquote>I prayed to God to direct and lead me to the truth in writing this book. It grieves me to oppose and criticize the man [[Galen]] from whose sea of knowledge I have drawn much. Indeed, he is the Master and I am the disciple. Although this reverence and appreciation will and should not prevent me from doubting, as I did, what is erroneous in his theories. I imagine and feel deeply in my heart that Galen has chosen me to undertake this task, and if he were alive, he would have congratulated me on what I am doing. I say this because Galen's aim was to seek and find the truth and bring light out of darkness. I wish indeed he were alive to read what I have published.<ref>Bashar Saad, Omar Said, ''Greco-Arab and Islamic Herbal Medicine: Traditional System, Ethics, Safety, Efficacy, and Regulatory Issues'', John Wiley & Sons, 2011. {{ISBN|9781118002261}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WQVF8nhKf4C&pg=PT33 page]</ref></blockquote>

; Crystallization of ancient knowledge, and the refusal to accept the fact that new data and ideas indicate that present day knowledge ultimately might surpass that of previous generations.

Al-Razi believed that contemporary scientists and scholars are by far better equipped, more knowledgeable, and more competent than the ancient ones, due to the accumulated knowledge at their disposal. Al-Razi's attempt to overthrow blind acceptance of the unchallenged authority of ancient sages encouraged and stimulated research and advances in the arts, technology, and sciences.

;''The Diseases of Children''

Al-Razi's ''The Diseases of Children'' was the first monograph to deal with pediatrics as an independent field of medicine.<ref name="Tschanz2"/><ref name="Elgood2"/>

;Mental health

As many other theorists in his time of exploration of illnesses, he believed that [[mental illness]]es were caused by demons. [[Demons]] were believed to enter the body and possess the body.

===The transmutation of metals===
Al-Razi's interest in alchemy and his strong belief in the possibility of [[Alchemy|transmutation]] of lesser metals to silver and gold was attested half a century after his death by [[Ibn an-Nadim]]'s book (''The Philosophers Stone''-Lapis Philosophorum in Latin). Nadim attributed a series of twelve books to al-Razi, plus an additional seven, including his refutation to [[al-Kindi]]'s denial of the validity of alchemy. Al-Kindi (801–873 CE) had been appointed by the Abbasid Caliph Ma'mum founder of Baghdad, to 'the [[House of Wisdom]]' in that city, he was a philosopher and an opponent of alchemy. Al-Razi's two best-known alchemical texts, which largely superseded his earlier ones: ''al-Asrar'' (الاسرار "The Secrets"), and ''Sirr al-Asrar'' (سر الاسرار "The Secret of Secrets"), which incorporates much of the previous work.

Apparently al-Razi's contemporaries believed that he had obtained the secret of turning iron and copper into gold. Biographer [[Khosro Moetazed]] reports in ''Mohammad Zakaria Razi'' that a certain [[General Simjur]] confronted al-Razi in public, and asked whether that was the underlying reason for his willingness to treat patients without a fee. "It appeared to those present that al-Razi was reluctant to answer; he looked sideways at the general and replied":<blockquote>I understand alchemy and I have been working on the characteristic properties of metals for an extended time. However, it still has not turned out to be evident to me, how one can transmute gold from copper. Despite the research from the ancient scientists done over the past centuries, there has been no answer. I very much doubt if it is possible...</blockquote>

===Major works on alchemy===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2021}}
Al-Razi's works present the first systematic classification of carefully observed and verified facts regarding chemical substances, reactions and apparatus, described in a language almost entirely free from mysticism and ambiguity.

* ''The Secret'' ({{transl|ar|Al-Asrar}})
: This book was written in response to a request from al-Razi's close friend, colleague, and former student, Abu Muhammad ibn Yunis [[Bukhara|al-Bukhari]], a Muslim mathematician, philosopher, and [[natural science|natural scientist]].

* ''Secret of Secrets'' ({{transl|ar|Sirr al-Asrar}})
: This is al-Razi's most famous book. Here he gives systematic attention to basic chemical operations important to the history of pharmacy.

: In his book {{transl|ar|Sirr al-Asrar}}, al-Razi divides the subject of "[[matter]]' into three categories, as in his previous book {{transl|ar|Al-Asrar}}.
:# Knowledge and identification of the medical components within substances derived from plants, animals, and minerals, and descriptions of the best types for medical treatments.
:# Knowledge of equipment and tools of interest to and used by either alchemists or [[apothecaries]].
:# Knowledge of seven [[alchemy|alchemical]] procedures and techniques: sublimation and condensation of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], precipitation of sulfur, and arsenic calcination of [[minerals]] (gold, silver, copper, lead, and iron), salts, glass, [[talc]], [[animal shell|shells]], and [[wax]]ing.

:: This last category contains additional descriptions of other methods and applications used in [[Chemical synthesis|transmutation]]:
::* The added mixture and use of solvent vehicles.
::* The amount of heat (fire) used, 'bodies and stones', ({{transl|ar|al-ajsad}} and {{transl|ar|al-ahjar}}) that can or cannot be transmuted into corporal substances such of metals and salts ({{transl|ar|al-amlah}}).
::* The use of a liquid [[mordant]] which quickly and permanently colors lesser metals for more lucrative sale and profit.

: Similar to the commentary on the 8th century text on [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]s ascribed to [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]], al-Razi gives methods and procedures of coloring a silver object to imitate gold ([[gold leafing]]) and the reverse technique of removing its color back to silver. [[Gilding]] and [[silvering]] of other metals ([[alum]], calcium salts, iron, copper, and [[tutty]]) are also described, as well as how colors will last for years without tarnishing or changing.

: Al-Razi classified minerals into six divisions:
# Four spirits ({{transl|ar|al-arwah}}): [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[sal ammoniac]], [[sulfur]], and arsenic sulfide ([[orpiment]] and [[realgar]]).
# [[Metals of antiquity|Seven bodies]] ({{transl|ar|al-ajsad}}): silver, gold, copper, iron, black lead ({{transl|ar|plumbago}}), [[zinc]] ({{transl|ar|kharsind}}), and [[tin]].
# Thirteen [[Gemstone|stones]] ({{transl|ar|al-ahjar}}): [[Marcasite]] ({{transl|ar|marqashita}}), [[Periclase|magnesia]], [[malachite]], [[tutty]] ({{transl|ar|tutiya}}, zinc oxide), [[talcum]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[gypsum]], [[azurite]], [[haematite]] (iron oxide), arsenic oxide{{which|date=November 2021}}, [[mica]], [[asbestos]], and glass (then identified as made of sand and alkali of which the transparent crystal damascene is considered the best).
# Seven [[vitriol]]s ({{transl|ar|al-zajat}}): [[alum]] ({{transl|ar|al-shabb}} {{lang|ar|الشب}}), and white ({{transl|ar|qalqadis}} {{lang|ar|القلقديس}}), black, red ({{transl|ar|suri}} {{lang|ar|السوري}}), and yellow ({{transl|ar|qulqutar}} {{lang|ar|القلقطار}}) vitriols (the impure sulfates of iron, copper, etc.), green ({{transl|ar|qalqand}} {{lang|ar|القلقند}}).
# Seven [[borate]]s: [[natron]], and impure sodium borate.
# Eleven salts ({{transl|ar|al-amlah}}): including brine, [[Sodium chloride|common salt]], [[ash]]es, [[naphtha]], live [[calcium oxide|lime]], and [[urine]], [[Sodium chloride|rock]], and [[sea salt]]s. Then he separately defines and describes each of these substances, the best forms and colours of each, and the qualities of various adulterations.

:Al-Razi gives also a list of apparatus used in alchemy. This consists of 2 classes:
# Instruments used for the dissolving and melting of metals such as the blacksmith's hearth, bellows, crucible, thongs (tongue or ladle), {{linktext|macerator}}, stirring rod, cutter, grinder (pestle), file, shears, {{linktext|descensory}}, and semi-cylindrical iron mould.
# Utensils used to carry out the process of transmutation and various parts of the distilling apparatus: the retort, [[alembic]], shallow iron pan, potters kiln and blowers, large oven, cylindrical stove, glass cups, flasks, [[phial]]s, beakers, glass funnel, crucible, [[aludel]], heating lamps, mortar, cauldron, hair-cloth, sand- and water-bath, sieve, flat stone mortar and chafing-dish.

==Philosophy==
===Metaphysics===

Al-Razi's metaphysical doctrine derives from the theory of the "five eternals", according to which the world is produced out of an interaction between God and four other eternal principles ([[soul]], [[matter]], time, and [[place (mathematics)|place]]).<ref name=oxford>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780195379488| last = Marenbon| first = John| title = The Oxford Handbook of Medieval Philosophy| date = 14 June 2012|pages=69–70}}</ref> He accepted a pre-socratic type of [[atomism]] of the bodies, and for that he differed from both the [[falasifa]] and the [[mutakallimun]].<ref name=oxford /> While he was influenced by [[Plato]] and the medical writers, mainly [[Galen]], he rejected [[taqlid]] and thus expressed criticism about some of their views. This is evident from the title of one of his works, ''Doubts About Galen''.<ref name=oxford />

[[File:Rhazes (c. 1906) - Veloso Salgado.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|al-Razi as depicted by [[Veloso Salgado]] (c. 1906)]]
===Excerpt from ''The Philosophical Approach''===
<blockquote>(...) In short, while I am writing the present book, I have written so far around 200 books and articles on different aspects of science, philosophy, theology, and ''[[hekmat]]'' (wisdom). (...) I never entered the service of any king as a military man or a man of office, and if I ever did have a conversation with a king, it never went beyond my medical responsibility and advice. (...) Those who have seen me know, that I did not into excess with eating, drinking or acting the wrong way. As to my interest in science, people know perfectly well and must have witnessed how I have devoted all my life to science since my youth. My patience and diligence in the pursuit of science has been such that on one special issue specifically I have written 20,000 pages (in small print), moreover I spent fifteen years of my life -night and day- writing the big collection entitled '''Al Hawi'''. It was during this time that I lost my eyesight, my hand became paralyzed, with the result that I am now deprived of reading and writing. Nonetheless, I've never given up, but kept on reading and writing with the help of others. I could make concessions with my opponents and admit some shortcomings, but I am most curious what they have to say about my scientific achievement. If they consider my approach incorrect, they could present their views and state their points clearly, so that I may study them, and if I determined their views to be right, I would admit it. However, if I disagreed, I would discuss the matter to prove my standpoint. If this is not the case, and they merely disagree with my approach and way of life, I would appreciate they only use my written knowledge and stop interfering with my behaviour.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the ''Philosophical Biography'', as seen above, he defended his personal and philosophical life style. In this work he laid out a framework based on the idea that there is life after death full of happiness, not suffering. Rather than being self-indulgent, man should pursue knowledge, utilise his intellect and apply justice in his life.

According to al-Razi: "This is what our merciful Creator wants. The One to whom we pray for reward and whose punishment we fear."

In brief, man should be kind, gentle and just. Al-Razi believed that there is a close relationship between spiritual integrity and physical health. He did not implicate that the soul could avoid distress due to his fear of death. He simply states that this psychological state cannot be avoided completely unless the individual is convinced that, after death, the soul will lead a better life. This requires a thorough study of esoteric doctrines and/or religions. He focuses on the opinion of some people who think that the soul perishes when the body dies. Death is inevitable, therefore one should not pre-occupy the mind with it, because any person who continuously thinks about death will become distressed and think as if he is dying when he continuously ponders on that subject. Therefore, he should forget about it in order to avoid upsetting himself. When contemplating his destiny after death, a benevolent and good man who acts according to the ordinances of the Islamic ''Shari`ah'', has after all nothing to fear because it indicates that he will have comfort and permanent bliss in the Hereafter. The one who doubts the ''Shari`ah'', may contemplate it, and if he diligently does this, he will not deviate from the right path. If he falls short, Allah will excuse him and forgive his sins because it is not demanded of him to do something which he cannot achieve.
:—Dr. Muhammad Abdul-Hadi Abu Reidah</blockquote>

===Views on religion===

A number of contradictory works and statements about religion have been ascribed to al-Razi. Many sources claim that al-Razi viewed prophecy and revealed religion as unnecessary and delusional, claiming that all humans have the ability to access and discover truth (including the existence of God) through God-given reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Lenn |editor1-last=Audi |editor1-first=Robert |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |date=1995 |publisher=The Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-40224-7 |pages=20–21 |quote=In keeping with the Epicureanism he might have imbibed from Galenic sources, he rejects special prophecy as imposture, arguing that reason, God's gift to all alike, is sufficient guidance.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Groff |first1=Peter |title=Islamic Philosophy A-Z |date=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9780748620890 |pages=180–181 |quote=Accordingly, al-Razi takes a rather dim view of prophecy, which in his view is both unnecessary and delusional, and indeed he criticizes all revealed religions as provincial and divisive.

In contrast, [[al-Biruni]] notes that al-Razi appeared to write in defense of religion in some texts but against it in others. According to al-Biruni's ''Bibliography of al-Razi'' (''Risāla fī Fihrist Kutub al-Rāzī''), al-Razi wrote two "heretical books": "''Fī al-Nubuwwāt'' (''On Prophecies'') and "''Fī Ḥiyal al-Mutanabbīn'' (''On the Tricks of False Prophets''). According to Biruni, the first "was claimed to be against religions" and the second "was claimed as attacking the necessity of the prophets."<ref name=Biruni>{{Cite journal| volume = 9| pages = 51–100| last = Deuraseh| first = Nurdeng| title = Risalat Al-Biruni Fi Fihrist Kutub Al-Razi: A Comprehensive Bibliography of the Works of Abu Bakr Al-Rāzī (d. 313 A.h/925) and Al-Birūni (d. 443/1051)| journal = Journal of Aqidah and Islamic Thought| year = 2008}}</ref> In his ''Risala'', Biruni further criticized and expressed caution about al-Razi's religious views, noting an influence of [[Manichaeism]]. However, Biruni also listed some other works of al-Razi on religion, including ''Fi Wujub Da‘wat al-Nabi ‘Ala Man Nakara bi al-Nubuwwat'' (''Obligation to Propagate the Teachings of the Prophet Against Those who Denied Prophecies'') and ''Fi anna li al-Insan Khaliqan Mutqinan Hakiman'' (''That Man has a Wise and Perfect Creator''), listed under his works on the "divine sciences".<ref name=Biruni /> None of his works on religion are now extant in full.

==== Debate with Abu Hatim ====

Other views and quotes that are often ascribed to al-Razi where he appears to be critical of religion are found in a book written by [[Abu Hatim Ahmad ibn Hamdan al-Razi|Abu Hatim al-Razi]], called ''Aʿlām al-nubuwwa'' (Signs of Prophecy), which documents a debate between Abu Hatim and al-Razi. Abu Hatim was an [[Isma'ili]] missionary who debated al-Razi, but whether he has faithfully recorded the views of al-Razi is disputed.<ref name=oxford /> Some historians claim that Abu Hatim accurately represented al-Razi's skepticism of revealed religion while others argue that Abu Hatim's work should be treated with skepticism given that he is a hostile source of al-Razi's beliefs and might have portrayed him as a heretic to discount his critique of the Ismāʿīlīs.<ref name="Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1999 p. 353">Seyyed Hossein Nasr, and Mehdi Amin Razavi, ''An Anthology of Philosophy in Persia'', vol. 1, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 353, quote: "Among the other eminent figures who attacked Rāzī are the Ismāʿīlī philosopher Abū Ḥatem Rāzī, who wrote two books to refute Rāzī's views on theodicy, prophecy, and miracles; and Nāṣir-i Khusraw. Shahrastānī, however, indicates that such accusations should be doubted since they were made by Ismāʿīlīs, who had been severely attacked by Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyā Rāzī"</ref>

According to Abdul Latif al-'Abd, Islamic philosophy professor at Cairo University, Abu Hatim and his student, [[Ḥamīd al-dīn Karmānī]] (d. after 411AH/1020CE), were Isma'ili extremists who often misrepresented the views of al-Razi in their works.<ref name="al-Abd" /><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 9789004255371| last = Ebstein| first = Michael| title = Mysticism and Philosophy in al-Andalus: Ibn Masarra, Ibn al-ʿArabī and the Ismāʿīlī Tradition| date = 25 November 2013|page=41}}</ref> This view is also corroborated by early historians like [[al-Shahrastani]] who noted "that such accusations should be doubted since they were made by Ismāʿīlīs, who had been severely attacked by Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyā Rāzī".<ref name="Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1999 p. 353"/> Al-'Abd points out that the views allegedly expressed by al-Razi contradict what is found in al-Razi's own works, like the ''Spiritual Medicine'' (''Fī al-ṭibb al-rūḥānī'').<ref name="al-Abd">{{Cite book| publisher = Maktabat al-Nahḍa al-Miṣriyya| last = Abdul Latif Muhammad al-Abd| title = Al-ṭibb al-rūḥānī li Abū Bakr al-Rāzī| location = Cairo| year = 1978| pages=4, 13, 18}}</ref> [[Peter Adamson (philosopher)|Peter Adamson]] concurs that Abu Hatim may have "deliberately misdescribed" al-Razi's position as a rejection of Islam and revealed religions. Instead, al-Razi was only arguing against the use of miracles to prove [[Muhammad]]'s prophecy, [[anthropomorphism]], and the uncritical acceptance of ''[[taqlīd]]'' vs ''naẓar''.<ref name=oxford /> Adamson points out to a work by [[Fakhr al-din al-Razi]] where al-Razi is quoted as citing the [[Quran]] and the prophets to support his views.<ref name=oxford />

In contrast, other historians, such as [[Paul Kraus (Arabist)|Paul Kraus]] and [[Sarah Stroumsa]], accept that the extracts found in Abu Hatim's book were either said by al-Razi during a debate or were quoted from a now lost work.  According to the debate with Abu Hatim, al-Razi denied the validity of prophecy or other authority figures, and rejected prophetic miracles. He also directed a scathing critique on revealed religions and the miraculous quality of the Quran.<ref name=oxford /><ref>{{cite book | author=Paul E. Walker | editor=Charles E.

==Criticism==
Al-Razi's religious and philosophical views were later criticized by [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] and [[Avicenna]] in the early 11th century. Biruni in particular wrote a short treatise (''[[risalah (fiqh)|risala]]'') dealing with al-Razi, criticizing him for his sympathy with [[Manichaeism]],<ref name=Watt>{{cite web|author=William Montgomery Watt|date=14 April 2004|title=BĪRŪNĪ and the study of non-Islamic Religions|url=http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?article31|access-date=25 January 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210053854/http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?article31|archive-date=10 February 2009|author-link=William Montgomery Watt}}</ref> his [[Hermeticism|Hermetical]] writings, his religious and philosophical views,<ref>Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] (1993), ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'', p. 166.

[[Nasr-i-Khosraw]] posthumously accused him of having plagiarized [[Iranshahri]], whom Khosraw considered the master of al-Razi.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = North Atlantic Books| isbn = 9781556432699| last = Corbin| first = Henry| title = The Voyage and the Messenger: Iran and Philosophy| date = 1998| page=72| quote=Al-Razi was posthumously accused of having plagiarized his master in Nasr-i-Khosraw polemics, and the latter did not hide his sympathy for Iranshahri.}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The modern-day [[Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute|Razi Institute]] in [[Karaj]] and [[Razi University]] in [[Kermanshah]] were named after him. A "Razi Day" ("Pharmacy Day") is commemorated in Iran every 27 August.<ref>[http://qhu.ac.ir/default.aspx?culture=fa-IR&page=news&newsid=350 qhu.ac.ir]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Razi commemoration day</ref>
