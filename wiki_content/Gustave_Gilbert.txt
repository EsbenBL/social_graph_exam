'''Gustave Mark Gilbert''' (September 30, 1911&nbsp;– February 6, 1977) was an American [[psychologist]] best known for his writings containing observations of high-ranking [[Nazism|Nazi]] leaders during the [[Nuremberg trials]]. His 1950 book ''The Psychology of Dictatorship'' was an attempt to profile the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] using as reference the testimonials of Hitler's closest generals and commanders. Gilbert's published work is still a subject of study in many universities and colleges, especially in the field of psychology.

==Early life and education==
Gilbert was born in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1911, the son of [[Jewish]]-[[Austria]]n [[immigrant]]s. He won a [[scholarship]] from the School for Ethical Culture at the College Town Center in New York. In 1939, Gilbert obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in [[psychology]] from [[Columbia University]]. Gilbert also held a diploma from the [[American Board of Examiners]] in professional psychology.

During [[World War II]], Gilbert was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] with the rank of [[First Lieutenant]].{{sfn|Nicholson |2016|p=}} Because of his knowledge of [[German language|German]], he was sent overseas as a translator.{{sfn|Nicholson |2016|p=}}

==Nuremberg trials==
In 1945, after the end of the war, Gilbert was sent to [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]], as a [[translator]] for the [[International Military Tribunal]] for the trials of the World War II German prisoners. Gilbert was appointed the prison psychologist of the German prisoners. During the process of the trials Gilbert became, after [[Douglas Kelley]],{{sfn|El-Hai|2013}} the confidant of [[Hermann Göring]], [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], [[Wilhelm Keitel]], [[Hans Frank]], [[Oswald Pohl]], [[Otto Ohlendorf]], [[Rudolf Höss]], and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], among others. Gilbert and Kelley administered the [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblot test]] to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group prior to the first set of trials.{{sfn|Main|2015|p=}} Gilbert also participated in the [[Nuremberg trials]] as the American Military Chief Psychologist and provided testimony attesting to the sanity of [[Rudolf Hess]].

In 1946, after the trials, Gilbert returned to the US. Gilbert stayed busy teaching, researching, and writing. In 1947 he published part of his diary, consisting of observations taken during interviews, interrogations, "eavesdropping" and conversations with German prisoners, under the title ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''. (This diary was reprinted in full in 1961 just before the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Jerusalem]].) The following is a famous exchange Gilbert had with Göring from this book:

{{quote|'''Göring:''' Why, of course, the ''people'' don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in [[England]], nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the ''leaders'' of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a [[democracy]], or a [[fascist]] dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.

'''Gilbert:''' There is one difference. In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only [[United States Congress|Congress]] can declare wars.

'''Göring:''' Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the [[pacifism|pacifists]] for lack of [[patriotism]] and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.}}

==Later life==
In 1948, as Head Psychologist at the Veterans Hospital at Lyons, NJ, Gilbert treated veterans of World Wars [[World War I|I]] and II who had suffered [[nervous breakdown]]s.

In 1950, Gilbert published ''The Psychology of Dictatorship: Based on an Examination of the Leaders of Nazi Germany''. In this book, Gilbert made an attempt to portray a profile of the psychological behavior of [[Adolf Hitler]], based on [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] work from eyewitness reports from Hitler's commanders in prison in Nuremberg.

In September 1954, while he was an Associate Professor of Psychology at [[Michigan State College]], Gilbert attended the 62nd Annual Convention of the [[American Psychological Association]] in New York. Gilbert was part of a four-person panel discussing "Psychological Approaches to the Problem of Anti-Intellectualism."

In 1961, when he was the chairman of the psychology department of [[Long Island University]] in [[Brooklyn]], Gilbert was summoned to testify in the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem. Gilbert testified on May 29, 1961, describing how both [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] and [[Rudolf Höss]] tried in their conversations with him to put the responsibility for the [[The Holocaust|extermination of the Jews]] on each other's doorstep. Nevertheless, Eichmann appeared in the accounts of both men. Then he presented a document, handwritten by Höss, that surveys the process of extermination at [[Auschwitz]] and different sums of people gassed there&nbsp;– under Höss as commandant and according to an oral report by Eichmann. The court decided not to accept Gilbert's psychological analyses of the prisoners at Nuremberg as part of his testimony.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/Sessions/index-03.html | title = Transcript of the trial of Adolf Eichmann | volume = III}} (Sessions 55, 56 and 57 contains the testimony of Gilbert) from the [[Nizkor Project]]</ref>

In 1967, Gilbert convinced Leon Pomeroy, then a recent graduate from [[University of Texas at Austin]], to build a clinical doctoral program in the field of psychology at Long Island University. At the time, Gilbert was serving as chairman of the psychology department of Long Island University in [[Brooklyn, New York]].

Gilbert died on 6 February 1977.{{sfn|Williams|1977|p=}}
