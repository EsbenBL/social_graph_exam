=== Research and work ===

Besteman began working in southern Somalia in the late eighties before the outbreak of civil war in 1991.<ref>[http://www.theglobalexperts.org/experts/expertise-region/north-america-expertise-region/catherine-besteman "Catherine Besteman"].

During the 2000s, Besteman studied Cape Town, South Africa, focusing on the work of grassroots organizations in the city after the end of apartheid.
