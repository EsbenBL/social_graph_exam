==Early career==
Bakke joined the faculty of Yale in 1932<ref name="nyt-obit"/> where he became a fellow at the [[Jonathan Edwards College]]<ref name="nyt-1934-br"/> and taught sociology from 1932 to 1934.<ref name="ilr-lib">{{cite web | url=https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/library/kheel-center/collections/research-guides/personnel-management | title=Personnel Management | publisher=Catherwood Library, Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations | accessdate=March 28, 2015}}</ref>  He then shifted fields and became an assistant professor of economics in 1934.<ref name="ilr-lib"/>  He subsequently became professor of economics in 1938 then received the Sterling Professor designation in 1940.<ref name="ilr-lib"/>  Within the interdisciplinary [[Yale Institute of Human Relations]] he was Director of Unemployment Studies during 1934–39.<ref name="ilr-lib"/>  He was also the main social economist who consulted to the [[Social Security Board (United States)|Social Security Board]] from 1936 to 1939.<ref name="ilr-lib"/>

His first book, ''The Unemployed Man'' (1934), was based on his experiences in England and received praise for his research methods and for the work's depiction of the human effects of unemployment, such as in his quote from one subject: "With a job there is a future, without a job there is a slow death of all that makes a man ambitious, industrious and glad to live."<ref name="nyt-1934-br">{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1934/06/03/95046290.html?pageNumber=52 | title=Men Without Work | first=Rose C. | last=Feld | newspaper=The New York Times Book Review | date=June 3, 1934 | page=52}}</ref>  The effects highlighted also included the loss of self-esteem to men as their wives and daughters found work but they, as traditional heads of households, did not.<ref>{{cite book | title=Family Men: Fatherhood and Masculinity in Britain, 1914–1960 | first=Laura | last=King | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2015 | pages=160–161}}</ref>

He then conducted an eight-year study of the effects of unemployment in local [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and published two works – ''The Unemployed Worker'' and ''Citizens Without Work'' – in 1940 from that study.<ref name="huffpo-learn"/>  Bakke focused not just on the economic characteristics of unemployment but also on the social and psychological consequences and costs from it.<ref name="huffpo-learn"/>  As such, Bakke became known for the sensitivity which he brought to this subject.<ref name="patterson"/>  He emphasized the distaste the unemployed often had in applying for government relief, as illustrated by quotes like "I'd rather be dead and buried" and, when another was ultimately compelled to do so, "I would hide my face in the ground and pound the earth."<ref name="patterson">{{cite book | title=America's Struggle against Poverty in the Twentieth Century | edition=Enlarged | first=James T. | last=Patterson | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2009 | pages=52–53}}</ref>  The 2004 ''Encyclopedia of the Great Depression'' states that Bakke's New Haven study stands "as a powerful statement of the importance of stable, adequately-paying work opportunities for individual well-being, as well as broader social well-being" and that even given his other contributions to sociology, economics, and industrial relations, "Bakke's study of Depression-era unemployment remains his most influential and far-reaching work."<ref name="enc-gd">{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of the Great Depression: A–K | volume=1 | editor-first=Robert S. | editor-last=McElvaine | publisher=Macmillan Reference USA | location=New York | year=2004 | pages=86–87}}</ref>  Alice O'Connor, a professor of history at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], wrote in 2010 that, "Seventy years later, the study's analysis still resonates".<ref name="huffpo-learn">{{cite news | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alice-oconnor/post_446_b_372166.html | title=What We Can Learn From E.

==Later career==
During World War II, Bakke was co-chair of the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|National War Labor Board's]] appeals committee.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>  At times during his career he also served as a consultant to the [[U.S. Department of State]] and the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] regarding foreign programs for management retraining.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>    In 1948 during the [[Truman administration]] he was appointed to the presidential [[Bituminous Coal Emergency Board]], invoked under the [[Taft-Hartley Labor Act]], which within a week reported that the threat of a coal strike harmful to the public interest had been avoided.<ref name="ilr-lib"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/06/27/110055557.html?pageNumber=41 | title=Coal Crisis Over, Truman Body Says | first=John D. | last=Morris | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 27, 1948 | page=41}}</ref>  In terms of politics, Bakke characterized himself as an [[Independent (voter)|independent]].<ref name="cby"/>

As founding director of the [[Yale Labor and Management Center]], Bakke's aim was to establish a scientific approach towards establishing and testing hypotheses about human actions in industrial relations and thereby establish an explanatory theory of behavior that could eventually help find ways to reduce the amount of labor-management conflict.<ref name="nyt-1946">{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/07/15/88369490.html?pageNumber=23 | title=Behavior Studied for Labor Peace | first=Russell | last=Porter | newspaper=The New York Times | date=July 15, 1946 | page=23}}</ref>  Staging clinical working sessions between labor and management, he was able to bring representatives of both onto campus<ref name="cby"/> as one case of his abilities at influencing people.  He was publicly passionate about the importance of the work, saying in 1946 that the survival of American democracy itself was at stake and that labor and management must work for "mutual survival, not separate survival."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/08/01/93139109.html?pageNumber=30 | title=Professor Warns Labor, Business | first=Russell | last=Porter | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 1, 1946 | page=30}}</ref>  Bakke's earlier work as a sociologist before being an economist constituted a varied background that led him to construct an interdisciplinary approach that was beneficial for the field of industrial relations.<ref name="kaufman-oande">{{cite book | title=The Origins & Evolution of the Field of Industrial Relations in the United States | first=Bruce E. | last=Kaufman | publisher=Cornell University Press | location=Ithaca, New York | year=1993 | pages=71, 80–81}}</ref>

Much of Bakke's later career was taken up with the study of [[organizational theory]], looking to find a theoretical approach to analysis that would explain not only behavior in businesses but also the same in other entities such as churches or schools.<ref name="pugh-hickson">{{cite book | title=Great Writers on Organizations | first=Derek S. | last=Pugh | first2= David J. | last2=Hickson | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | edition=Third Omnibus | location=Aldershot, Hampshire | year= 2007 | pages=117–119}}</ref>  In books such as ''Bonds of Organization: An Appraisal of Corporate Human Relations'' (1950) he defined all activities of an organization as to falling into one of five categories: perpetuation, workflow, control, identification, and homeostasis.<ref name="pugh-hickson"/>  He devised a fusion process theory as a way of expressing how organizations, and individuals within them, accommodate divergent interests.<ref name="pugh-hickson"/>  As such, Bakke was regarding among a group of other eminent organizational theorists active in the 1950s, including [[Chris Argyris]], [[James G. March]], [[Rensis Likert]], [[Jacob Marschak]], [[Anatol Rapoport]], and [[William Foote Whyte]].<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=2390625 | title= ''Modern Organization Theory'' edited by Mason Haire | first=Rollin B. | last=Posey | journal=Administrative Science Quarterly | volume= 5 | number= 4 | date=March 1961| pages= 609–611 | doi=10.2307/2390625}}</ref>

In 1958 Bakke published a report for the center entitled "The Human Resources Function".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/irle/ucb/text/lb001817.pdf | title=The Human Resources Function | first=E. Wight | last=Bakke | publisher=Yale Labor and Management Center | date=1958}}</ref>  This is credited by [[Georgia State University]] professor and industrial relations scholar Bruce E. Kaufman as being the first use of the term "[[human resources]]" in its modern form, although Bakke used in a more pervasive sense to refer to all working relationships within an organization and not just those handled by a personnel department.<ref name="kaufman-hr">{{cite book | title=Managing the Human Factor: The Early Years of Human Resource Management in American Industry | first=Bruce E. | last=Kaufman | publisher=Cornell University Press | location=Ithaca, New York | year=2008 | page=312n28}}</ref>

In addition to his role at Yale, in 1929 Bakke was one of the co-founders of the nearby Connecticut College of Commerce, subsequently holding a life position on its board of trustees and serving as chair of the board.<ref name="jcc-board-46"/>  In 1946, when it was known as the Junior College of Commerce, also served as vice president in the college's administration.<ref name="jcc-board-46">{{cite web | url=http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/archives/quinnipiachistory/catalogs/1946part1.pdf | title=Catalog for Day and Evening Divisions, 1946–1947 | publisher=The Junior College of Commerce | date=1946 | pages=7, 8, 14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093636/http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/archives/quinnipiachistory/catalogs/1946part1.pdf | archivedate=2015-04-02 }}</ref>  He remained chair of the board in later years, by which time it was known as [[Quinnipiac College]].<ref name="nyt-obit"/>

In 1953 he received a [[Fulbright professorship]] to teach at [[Copenhagen Business School]], where he also set up a pilot study in human relations research in a Danish factory.<ref name="cby"/>  He served as president of the [[Industrial Relations Research Association]] for 1958.<ref name="kaufman-oande"/>  In 1964 he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from his alma mater of Northwestern University.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/committees/honorary-degrees/honorary-degree-recipients.html#b | title=Honorary Degree Recipients: B | publisher=Northwestern University | accessdate=April 4, 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411192353/http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/committees/honorary-degrees/honorary-degree-recipients.html#b | archivedate=April 11, 2015 }}</ref>

His last book, about [[Counterculture of the 1960s|student activism in the 1960s]], was written in collaboration with his wife Mary, who was an accomplished academic herself and had taught and served as a dean at [[Quinnipiac College]].<ref name="mary-obit"/>  He died at his home in [[Woodbridge, Connecticut]], on November 23, 1971, at age sixty-eight.<ref name="nyt-obit">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/11/24/79407758.pdf | title=E.
