'''Arthur Melvin''' "'''Art'''" '''Okun''' (November 28, 1928 – March 23, 1980) was an American economist. He served as the chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] between 1968 and 1969.  Before serving on the C.E.A., he was a professor at [[Yale University]] and, afterwards, was a fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]] in Washington, D.C.
In 1968 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-08-20.</ref>

Okun is known in particular for promulgating [[Okun's law]], an observed relationship that states that for every 1% increase in the [[unemployment rate]], a country's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] will be roughly an additional 2% lower than its [[potential GDP]]. He is also known as the creator of the [[misery index (economics)|misery index]] and the analogy of the [[deadweight loss]] of taxation with a leaky bucket.<ref>Okun, Arthur M. (1975), ''Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff''. Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1975, pp. 91–92.</ref> He died on March 23, 1980 of a heart attack. <ref> [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/03/24/arthur-okun-dies-economic-adviser-to-johnson/9157cfb8-6eac-46ac-a8ea-50cc54176aa9 Arthur Okun Dies, Economic Adviser to Johnson], accessed 2020-08-14.</ref>
