'''Frank William Taussig''' (1859–1940) was an American [[economist]] who is credited with creating the foundations of modern [[international trade|trade theory]].

==Early life==
[[File:Taussig - Wages and capital, 1935 - 5780967.tif|thumb|''Wages and Capital'', 1935]]
He was born on December 28, 1859, in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], the son of [[William Taussig]] and Adele Wuerpel.  His parents encouraged his literary and musical interests, and he played the violin at an early age. He was educated in the St. Louis public schools and at Smith Academy in that same city. He then went to [[Washington University]] there but, after a year transferred to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] from where he graduated in 1879.<ref name=dab>{{Cite DAB|title=Taussig, Frank William|author=Edward S. Mason|year=1958|volume=Supplement Two}}</ref>

He traveled in Europe for a year, taking some time to study economics at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. He then did graduate work at Harvard in law and economics while he was secretary to President [[Charles W. Eliot]] for some years.

==Teaching==
He got a law degree in 1886 and was appointed assistant professor at Harvard.<ref name=anb>{{Cite ANB|title=Taussig, Frank William|author=Ann T. Keene |id=1400620}}</ref> He became professor of economics in 1892, and he remained at Harvard for the balance of his professional career except for several years spent in federal service and some time spent traveling in Europe recovering from a nervous disorder.<ref name="dab"/>

==Beliefs==
Taussig was an open advocate of [[forced sterilization]] of races and classes he considered inferior. In his 1911 textbook ''Principles of Economics'', Taussing remarked: {{quote|Certain types of criminals and paupers breed only their kind, and society has a right and a duty to protect its members from the repeated burden of maintaining and guarding such parasites.&nbsp;... The human race could be immensely improved in quality, and its capacity for happy living immensely increased, if those of poor physical and mental endowment were prevented from multiplying.<ref name="taussig1915">{{cite book|author=F. W. Taussig|title=Principles of Economics|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesecono03tausgoog|year=1915|pages=[https://archive.org/details/principlesecono03tausgoog/page/n259 236]–}}</ref>}}

[[Paul Douglas]] (a future president of the American Economic Association and three-term Senator from Illinois) was a graduate student under Taussig at Harvard in the Fall of 1915 and recalled the experience. Douglas had studied two years in graduate school at Columbia University with [[Edwin Seligman]], who was an ideological enemy of Taussig. Given the opportunity to criticize the Columbia school of economic thought by confronting Douglas, Taussig attempted to humiliate him to the delight of the Harvard pupils who filled the lecture hall to witness the "slaughter". Eventually, Douglas turned the tables and trapped Taussig in a logical economic debate. Douglas recalled, "The following day, Taussig cordially shook hands with me at the end of the hour.&nbsp;... We also became fast friends for the rest of his life. Trying as the experience was, it was the best thing to happen to me in my academic life. It forced me to master the reasoning of the great economic theorists and to stand my ground under verbal and logical bombardment."<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul H. |last=Douglas |title=In the Fullness of Time |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1971 |pages=28–34}}</ref>

==Beet sugar and tariff==
In a 1912 article in The ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'', Taussig favored protecting the [[sugar beet|beet]] [[sugar industry]] with a tariff on sugar imports. A beet sugar industry gives intangible benefits by adding to the versatility and capabilities of American agriculture. Unskilled labor gains employment in the labor-intensive beet sugar sector of agriculture. Beet sugar grows best in cool climates of the irrigated regions of Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, and California.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Taussig, F. W. |title=Beet Sugar and the Tariff|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=26| issue =  2|year=1912|pages=189–214|jstor=1884763|doi=10.2307/1884763}}</ref>

==Other positions held==
He was the editor of the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' from 1889 to 1890 and from 1896 to 1935, president of the [[American Economic Association]] in 1904 and 1905, and chair of the [[United States Tariff Commission]] from 1917 to 1919.

In March 1919, he was called to [[Paris]] to advise in the adjustment of commercial treaties, and in November, on invitation of [[Woodrow Wilson]], he attended the second industrial conference in [[Washington, DC]], for promoting peace between capital and labour. He was a strong supporter of the [[League of Nations]].

==Death==
He died on November 11, 1940, aged 80, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. Taussig is buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge.

==Legacy==
The successor to his chair at Harvard was [[Joseph Schumpeter]]. In 1888, he married Edith Thomas Guild.  One of their four children was [[Helen B. Taussig]] (1898–1986), a noted pediatrician and cardiologist.  F.&nbsp;W. Taussig's first wife died in 1910, and he married Laura Fisher.<ref name=dab/><ref name=anb/>
