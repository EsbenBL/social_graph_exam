'''Narrative therapy''' (or Narrative Practice<ref>{{Cite web|last=Re-Authoring|date=2015-08-18|title=What is narrative practice?|url=https://reauthoringteaching.com/what-is-narrative-practice/|access-date=2021-10-06|website=Re-Authoring Teaching|language=en-US}}</ref>) is a form of [[psychotherapy]] that seeks to help patients identify their values and the skills associated with them. It provides the patient with knowledge of their ability to live these values so they can effectively confront current and future problems. The therapist seeks to help the patient co-author a new [[narrative]] about themselves by investigating the history of those values.  Narrative therapy claims to be a [[social justice]] approach to therapeutic conversations, seeking to challenge dominant discourses that it claims shape people's lives in destructive ways. While narrative work is typically located within the field of family therapy, many authors and practitioners report using these ideas and practices in community work, schools and higher education.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Winslade |first1=John |last2=Monk |first2=Gerald |date=2000 |title=Narrative Mediation: A New Approach to Conflict Resolution |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |isbn=0787941921 |oclc=42598442}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nylund |first1=David |last2=Tilsen |first2=Julie |date=December 2006 |title=Pedagogy and praxis: postmodern spirit in the classroom |journal=Journal of Systemic Therapies |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=21–31 |doi=10.1521/jsyt.2006.25.4.21}}</ref> Narrative therapy has come to be associated with [[Collaborative therapy|collaborative]] as well as [[Person-centered therapy|person-centered]] therapy.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Malinen |editor1-first=Tapio |editor2-last=Cooper |editor2-first=Scot J. |editor3-last=Thomas |editor3-first=Frank N. |date=2012 |title=Masters of Narrative and Collaborative Therapies: The Voices of Andersen, Anderson, and White |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780789038258 |oclc=703208854 |doi=10.4324/9780203806999}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2020}}

== History ==
Narrative therapy was developed during the 1970s and 1980s, largely by Australian [[social worker]] [[Michael White (psychotherapist)|Michael White]] and [[David Epston]] of New Zealand,<ref name="WE90">{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Michael |author-link1=Michael White (psychotherapist) |last2=Epston |first2=David |date=1990 |title=Narrative Means to Therapeutic Ends |location=New York |publisher=[[W.

== Conversation maps ==
===Re-authoring identity===

The narrative therapist focuses upon assisting people to create stories about themselves, about their identities, that  are helpful to them. This work of "re-authoring identity" helps people identify their values and identify the skills and knowledge to live out these values by way of the therapist's skilled use of listening and questioning.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bavelas |first1=Janet B. |last2=Coates |first2=Linda |last3=Johnson |first3=Trudy |date=December 2000 |title=Listeners as co-narrators |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=941–952 |pmid=11138763 |doi=10.1037//0022-3514.79.6.941}}</ref> Through the process of identifying the history of values in people's lives, the therapist and client are able to co-author a new story about the person.<ref name=BrownAugustaScott>{{cite book |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Catrina |editor2-last=Augusta-Scott |editor2-first=Tod |date=2007 |title=Narrative Therapy: Making Meaning, Making Lives |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=978-1412909877 |oclc=64688794}}</ref>{{rp|24}}

The story people tell about themselves and that is told about them is important in this approach, which asserts that the story of a person's identity may determine what they think is possible for themselves. The narrative process allows people to identify what values are important to them and how they might use their own skills and knowledge to live these values.<ref name=BrownAugustaScott/>{{rp|36}}

This includes a focus on "unique outcomes" (a term of [[Erving Goffman]]) or exceptions to the problem that wouldn't be predicted by the problem's narrative or story itself.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Externalizing conversations ===
The concept of identity is important in narrative therapy. The approach aims not to conflate people's identities with the problems they may face or the mistakes they have made. Rather, the approach seeks to avoid modernist, essentialist notions of the self that lead people to believe there is a biologically determined "true self" or "true nature".  Instead, identity, seen as primarily social, can be changed according to the choices people make.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Michael |author-link=Michael White (psychotherapist) |date=2007 |title=Maps of Narrative Practice |location=New York |publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]] |page=139 |isbn=9780393705164 |oclc=76792066}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2020}}

To separate people's identities from the problems they face, narrative therapy employs {{em|externalizing}} conversations. The process of externalization allows people to consider their relationships with problems; thus the narrative motto: "The person is not the problem, the problem is the problem."<ref name="WE90"/>{{Page needed|date=October 2020}} A person's strengths or positive attributes also are externalized, allowing people to engage in the construction and performance of preferred identities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

An {{em|externalizing}} emphasis involves naming a problem so that a person can assess the problem's effects in their life, can analyze how the problem operates or works in their life, and in the end can choose their relationship to the problem.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== "Statement of Position Map" ===
In a narrative approach, the therapist aims to adopt a collaborative therapeutic posture rather than imposing ideas on people by giving them advice. Michael White developed a conversation map called a "Statement of Position Map" designed to elicit the client's own evaluation of the problems and developments in their lives. Both the therapist and the client are seen as having valuable information relevant to the process and the content of the therapeutic conversation. By adopting a posture of curiosity and collaboration, the therapist aims to give the implicit message to people that they already have knowledge and skills to solve the problems they face. When people develop solutions to their own problems on the basis of their own values, they may become much more committed to implementing these solutions.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Michael |author-link=Michael White (psychotherapist) |date=1995 |title=Re-Authoring Lives: Interviews & Essays |location=Adelaide |publisher=Dulwich Centre Publications |page=39 |isbn=9780646227351 |oclc=34403483}}</ref>

=== Re-membering practice ===
Narrative therapy identifies that identities are social achievements and the practice of re-membering draws closer those who support a person's preferred story about themselves and dis-engages those that do not support the person.{{Clarify|date=October 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Absent but implicit ===
Drawing the work of [[Jacques Derrida]], Michael White was curious about the values that were implicit in people's pain, sense of failure and actions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Often people only feel pain or failure in relation to their values, how they would prefer their relationships or life to be. Further, often there are stalled initiatives that people take in life that also are guided by implicit values.

=== Outsider witnesses map ===
In this particular narrative practice or conversation, outsider witnesses are invited listeners to a consultation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Often they are friends of the consulting person or past clients of the therapist who have their own knowledge and experience of the problem at hand. During the first interview, between therapist and consulting person, the outsider listens without comment.

Then the therapist interviews them with the instructions not to critique or evaluate or make a proclamation about what they have just heard, but instead to simply say what phrase or image stood out for them, followed by any resonances between their life struggles and those just witnessed. Lastly, the outsider is asked in what ways they may feel a shift in how they experience themselves from when they first entered the room.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Michael |author-link=Michael White (psychotherapist) |date=2004 |title=Narrative Practice and Exotic Lives: Resurrecting Diversity in Everyday Life |location=Adelaide |publisher=Dulwich Centre Publications |page=15 |isbn=9780957792999 |oclc=60583048}}</ref>

Next, in similar fashion, the therapist turns to the consulting person, who has been listening all the while, and interviews them about what images or phrases stood out in the conversation just heard and what resonances have struck a chord within them.

In the end, an outsider witness conversation is often rewarding for witnesses. But for the consulting person the outcomes are remarkable: they learn they are not the only one with this problem, and they acquire new images and knowledge about it and their chosen alternate direction in life. The main aim of the narrative therapy is to engage in people's problems by providing the alternative best solution.{{citation needed|reason=tending towards non-academic style|date=October 2013}}

== Therapeutic documents ==
Narrative therapy embodies a strong appreciation for the creation and use of documents, as when a person and a counsellor co-author "A Graduation from the Blues Certificate", for example.<ref>{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Martin |date=2006 |title=Narrative Therapy: An Introduction for Counsellors |edition=2nd |location=London; Thousand Oaks |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |page=106 |isbn=9781412920124 |oclc=62178252 |doi=10.4135/9781446213322}}</ref> In some instances, case notes are created collaboratively with clients to provide documentation as well as markers of progress.

== Social-political therapeutic approach ==
A strong awareness of the impact of power relations in therapeutic conversations, with a commitment to checking back with the client about the effects of therapeutic styles in order to mitigate the possible negative effect of invisible assumptions or preferences held by the therapist.<ref>{{cite book |last=Madigan |first=Stephen |date=2019 |title=Narrative Therapy |edition=2nd |series=Theories of Psychotherapy Series |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |page=81 |isbn=9781433829864 |oclc=1056201760 |doi=10.1037/0000131-000}}</ref> There is also an awareness of how social narratives such as femininity and masculinity can be corrupted and negatively influence peoples identities.<ref name=BrownAugustaScott/>{{rp|23–38}}

=== Eating disorders ===
Narrative therapy has made numerous contributions to the field of eating disorders. David Epston, Stephen Madigan and Catrina Brown have made the most significant contribution to bringing a depathologizing approach to this issue.<ref name=BrownAugustaScott/>{{Page needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Men and domestic violence ===
Narrative therapy has also been applied to work with men who abuse their female partners. Alan Jenkins and Tod Augusta-Scott have been the most prolific in this field. They integrated a social-political analysis of the violence, while at the same time engaging men in a respectful, collaborative manner.<ref name=BrownAugustaScott/>{{Page needed|date=October 2020}}<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Augusta-Scott |editor1-first=Tod |editor2-last=Scott |editor2-first=Katreena |editor3-last=Tutty |editor3-first=Leslie M. |date=2017 |title=Innovations in Interventions to Address Intimate Partner Violence: Research and Practice |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781138692268 |oclc=948558557 |doi=10.4324/9781315532776}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Community work ===
Narrative therapy has also been used in a variety of community settings. In particular, an exercise called "Tree of Life" has been used to mobilize communities to act according to their own values.<ref>{{cite book |last=Denborough |first=David |date=2014 |title=Retelling the Stories of Our Lives: Everyday Narrative Therapy to Draw Inspiration and Transform Experience |location=New York |publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]] |pages=11–21 |isbn=9780393708158 |oclc=855507198}}</ref>

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
There have been several formal criticisms of narrative therapy over what are viewed as its theoretical and methodological inconsistencies, among various other concerns.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fish |first=Vincent |date=July 1993 |title=Poststructuralism in family therapy: interrogating the narrative/conversatinal mode |journal=[[Journal of Marital and Family Therapy]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=221–232 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.1993.tb00983.x}}</ref><ref name="Minuchin, S. 1998">{{cite journal |last=Minuchin |first=Salvador |author-link=Salvador Minuchin |date=October 1998 |title=Where is the family in narrative family therapy? |journal=[[Journal of Marital and Family Therapy]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=397–403 |pmid=9801999 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.1998.tb01094.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Madigan |first=Stephen |date=March 1996 |title=The politics of identity: considering community discourse in the externalizing of internalized problem conversations |journal=Journal of Systemic Therapies |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=47–62 |doi=10.1521/jsyt.1996.15.1.47}}</ref> 
* Narrative therapy has been criticised as holding to a [[social constructionism|social constructionist]] belief that there are no absolute truths, but only socially sanctioned points of view, and that Narrative therapists simply privilege their client's concerns over and above "dominating" cultural narratives.<ref name="Minuchin, S. 1998"/><ref name="Doan, R.E. 1998">{{cite journal |last=Doan |first=Robert E. |date=Fall 1998 |title=The king is dead; long live the king: narrative therapy and practicing what we preach |journal=[[Family Process]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=379–385 |pmid=9879006 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1998.00379.x}}</ref>
* Several critics have posed concerns that narrative therapy has made gurus of its leaders, particularly in the light that its leading proponents tend to be overly harsh about most other kinds of therapy.<ref name="Minuchin, S. 1998"/><ref name="Doan, R.E. 1998"/> 
* Narrative therapy is also criticized for the lack of clinical and empirical studies to validate its many claims.<ref name="Etchison, M. 2000">{{cite journal |last1=Etchison |first1=Mary |last2=Kleist |first2=David M. |date=January 2000 |title=Review of narrative therapy: research and utility |journal=[[The Family Journal]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=61–66 |doi=10.1177/1066480700081009 |s2cid=143708204 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238335902}}</ref> Etchison & Kleist (2000) stated that narrative therapy's focus on {{em|qualitative}} outcomes is not congruent with larger {{em|quantitative}} research and findings which the majority of respected empirical studies employ today. This has led to a lack of research material which can support its claims of efficacy.<ref name="Etchison, M. 2000"/>
