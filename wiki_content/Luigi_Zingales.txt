'''Luigi Zingales''' ({{IPA-it|luˈiːdʒi ddziŋˈɡaːles}}; born 8 February 1963 in [[Padua, Italy]]) is a finance professor at the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]] and the author of two widely-reviewed books. His book ''[[Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists]]'' (2003) is a study of "relationship capitalism".<ref>{{cite news |title=Economic Scene; Are open markets threatened more by a pro-business or by an antibusiness ideology? |first=Virginia |last=Postrel |date=4 December 2003 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/04/business/economic-scene-are-open-markets-threatened-more-pro-business-antibusiness.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm}}</ref> In ''[[A Capitalism for the People|A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity]]'' (2012), Zingales "suggests that channeling populist anger can reinvigorate the power of competition and reverse the movement toward a 'crony system'."<ref>{{cite web |title=Nonfiction review |work=Publishers Weekly |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-465-02947-1 |date=April 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=The Financial Times |first=John |last=Plender |date=April 15, 2012 |title=Nostalgia for the land of opportunity |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/0415a456-8551-11e1-a75a-00144feab49a.html#axzz1y8F3hCTJ}}</ref>

==Career==
Zingales received a bachelor's degree in economics from [[Bocconi University]] in [[Milan]]. In 1992 he earned a [[Ph.D.]] in Economics from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] with the completion of his thesis, titled ''The value of corporate control'', under the supervision of [[James M. Poterba]] and [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/13214?show=full | access-date = 17 Sep 2015 | title = The value of corporate control by Luigi Zingales | publisher = MIT Library| hdl = 1721.1/13214?show=full }}</ref> In the same year he joined the faculty of the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]], where he is the [[Robert C. McCormack]] Distinguished Service Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/bio.aspx?person_id=12826023936 |title=Luigi Zingales |access-date=2012-06-18}}</ref> Zingales also serves as a member of the [[Committee on Capital Markets Regulation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://capmktsreg.org/ |title=Committee on Capital Markets Regulation  |access-date=2012-06-18}}</ref>

==Positions==
Zingales has been featured prominently in news media, which falls in line with his belief that economists should take a more public stance regarding what they believe in. While a traditional economist in many respects, he is known for some of his unique opinions. He has advocated replacing all taxes with a single [[consumption tax]], a position usually associated with political conservatives. On the other hand, he has voiced support for greater regulation of the banking industry.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zingales|first=Luigi|date=2012-05-29|title=How Political Clout Made Banks Too Big to Fail|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2012-05-29/how-political-clout-made-banks-too-big-to-fail|access-date=2020-10-06|website=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> Perhaps most interesting is his support of the [[United States debt ceiling]], which is almost universally held in low regard by his colleagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2013/01/23/luigi-zingales-congress-needs-to-keep-debt-ceiling/|title=Luigi Zingales: Congress needs to keep debt ceiling|first=Orange County|last=Register|date=23 January 2013}}</ref>

In July 2012, Zingales took part in the 'No-Brainer Economic Platform' project of [[NPR]]'s program ''[[Planet Money]]''. He supported a six-part reform plan that involved eliminating all American [[Income tax in the United States|income]], [[Corporate tax in the United States|corporate]], and [[Taxation in the United States#Payroll taxes|payroll taxes]] as well as the [[war on drugs]] and replacing the system with a broad [[consumption tax]] (including taxing formerly illegal substances).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate|title=Six Policies Economists Love (And Politicians Hate)|website=NPR.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/18/156928675/episode-387-the-no-brainer-economic-platform|title=Episode 387: The No-Brainer Economic Platform|website=NPR.org}}</ref>

Zingales generated controversy in 2018 when he invited former [[White House Chief Strategist]] [[Steve Bannon]] to debate [[globalization]] and [[immigration]] at the [[University of Chicago]] against an undecided expert in the field. The decision sparked protests from students and faculty given Bannon's history of controversial statements.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/01/26/steve-bannon-invitation-sparks-protests-at-university-of-chicago/|title=Steve Bannon invitation sparks protests at University of Chicago|last=Hogan|first=Susan|date=2018-01-26|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

In 2012, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine to its list of [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers]], "For reminding us what conservative economics used to look like."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,57 |title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers |date=26 November 2012 |work=Foreign Policy |access-date=28 November 2012 |archive-date=28 November 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CViUyRpk?url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,33 |url-status=live }}</ref>
