== Political struggle and development ==
Braverman was one of the many thousands of industrial workers who became radicalized by the events of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. He first became politically active in the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]] (YPSL), whose members were known as "Yipsels." Despite being largely composed of students and young radicals, the Yipsels openly dissented from the positions of the established communist groups, taking a firm stance on the need for socialist internationalism (in connection with the [[Spanish Civil War]]), providing enthusiastic support for worker uprisings and the formation of the CIO ([[Congress of Industrial Organizations]]), and roundly rejecting [[Stalinist]] politics and distortions.<ref name="palmer1999"/>{{rp|35–36}} Braverman was not afraid of unpopular positions. He sought repeatedly to deepen socialist politics by dispensing with simplistic formulations of Marxian theory. "Marxism," Braverman cautioned, "is not a ready-made slot-machine dogma, but a broad theory of social development which requires application and re-interpretation in every period."<ref name="braverman1956">Braverman, Harry. 1956.

=== Agitating during the Red Scare ===
After serving in the shipbuilding industry during [[World War II]], Braverman began to deepen his commitment to revolutionary struggle, joining the first [[Trotskyist]] party in the United States: the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP). His political engagement coincided the wave of political repression against socialists and communists known as the [[Red Scare]]. Even before the end of [[World War II]], 18 SWP leaders were imprisoned, becoming "the first victims of the notorious Smith Act, which made it a crime of treason to publish and proclaim the ideas of [[Marx]], [[Engels]], [[Lenin]], and [[Trotsky]]." Braverman himself was fired from his job at Republic Steel as a result of red-baiting tactics used by the [[FBI]]. Undeterred by the witch-hunts, Braverman continued his political work but disguised his activities by writing under the pseudonym "Harry Frankel".<ref name="palmer1999"/>{{rp|36–37}}

=== Socialist Unity ===
In the 1950s, Braverman was one of the leaders of the so-called "Cochranite tendency", a current led by [[Bert Cochran]] (who used the pseudonym "E. R. Frank") within the broader [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|SWP]]. Braverman participated to some extent in the [[sectarian]] politics prevalent among the various Trotskyist tendencies. However, after being expelled from the SWP in 1953, Braverman helped to found [[American Socialist Union|The Socialist Union]]—an explicit attempt to transcend [[sectarian]] politics and develop a broad left program focused on the U.S. Braverman became editor of ''The American Socialist'' (previously ''The Educator''), the publication of [[American Socialist Union|The Socialist Union]].<ref name="renton2004">{{Cite book | isbn = 1842772937 | title = Dissident Marxism: Past voices for present times | last1 = Renton | first1 = Dave | year = 2004 | publisher = Zed Books | location = New York}}</ref> It was in these pages that Braverman first began to think more concretely about labor, the labor process, machinery and class consciousness—what would become the key themes of ''Labor and Monopoly Capital'' just over a decade later.

=== From metal worker to editor ===
During the early 1960s, Harry Braverman worked as an editor for [[Grove Press]], where he was instrumental in publishing ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]''. In 1967 Braverman became managing director of Monthly Review Press, a position which he continued for the rest of his life. The editors of ''[[Monthly Review]]'', [[Paul A. Baran|Paul Baran]] and [[Paul M. Sweezy|Paul Sweezy]], and particularly their book ''[[Monopoly Capital]]'', had a significant influence on Braverman as he was developing his analysis of the labor process of twentieth-century capitalism.

== Revolutionary theory as a "tool for combat" ==
=== ''Labor and Monopoly Capital'' ===
Braverman's criticism of the labor process of [[Monopoly Capital|monopoly capitalism]] has had a lasting impact on the sociology of work and labor relations. In his book ''[[Labor and Monopoly Capital]]'',<ref name="braverman1974" /> Braverman extended Marx's writings on the impact of capitalist industrial growth on the labor process, paying specific attention to the growth of giant corporations and oligopolistic industries.<ref name=braverman-foster1974>Foster, John Bellamy.

</ref> Marx saw that the emergence of machinery and the increasing workers' control over the labor process since workers' skills shifted into tending the machines. This was seen as strengthening the owners of capital since they controlled the knowledge and skills needed to operate the factory, run the machines, and employ the workforce. This argument was furthered by Braverman who contended that such a labor force was defined by a weakened position relative to capital. Work became transformed from being a utilization of skills and experience into a mindless, machine-based, and powerless activity. He summarized the tenets of [[scientific management]] developed by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] as 1. disassociation of the labor process from the skills of workers, 2. separation of conception from execution, 3. use of monopoly power over knowledge to control each step of the labor process and its mode of execution.<ref name="Pagano2000"/> Braverman argued that Taylor's prescriptions for the workplace were "nothing less than the explicit verbalization of the capitalist mode of production".<ref name="braverman1974"/>{{rp|86}}
