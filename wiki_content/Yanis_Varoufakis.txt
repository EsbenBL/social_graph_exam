A former academic, he served as the Greek [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]] from January to July 2015 under Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]. Since 2018, he has been Secretary-General of [[MeRA25]], a left-wing political party, since he founded it in 2018. A former member of [[Syriza]], Varoufakis was a member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] for [[Athens B]] from January to September 2015; he regained a parliamentary seat in July 2019.

Varoufakis was born in [[Athens]] in 1961. He studied mathematics and economics at the [[University of Birmingham]] and the [[University of Essex]], where he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in economics. He then taught economics in the United Kingdom and then at the [[University of Sydney]], before returning to Greece in 2000 to teach at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]].

In January 2015, Varoufakis was appointed Greek Minister of Finance. He led negotiations with Greece's creditors during the [[Greek government-debt crisis|government-debt crisis]]. However, he failed to reach an agreement with the [[European troika]] (European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund) leading to the [[2015 Greek bailout referendum|2015 bailout referendum]]. The referendum rejected the troika bailout terms, and the day afterwards Varoufakis resigned as Minister of Finance, being replaced by [[Euclid Tsakalotos]]. On 24 August, Varoufakis voted against the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third bailout package]]; in the ensuing [[September 2015 Greek legislative election|September snap election]], he did not stand for reelection. Varoufakis has since appeared in numerous debates, lectures and interviews. In February 2016, he launched the [[Democracy in Europe Movement 2025]] (DiEM25) and subsequently backed a Remain vote in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]]. In March 2018, he founded MeRA25, the "electoral wing" of DiEM25 in Greece.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://internal.diem25.org/nl/vote/112/public|title=MeRA25 in national elections - July 7, 2019 - Stem van DiEM25 leden|website=DiEM25 - Democracy in Europe Movement 2025|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> In the [[2019 Greek legislative election|2019 legislative election]], MeRA25 was the sixth most voted-for party, amassing nine parliamentary seats, with Varoufakis himself returning to the Hellenic Parliament.

==Early life and education==
Varoufakis was born in [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Athens]], on 24 March 1961, to Georgios and Eleni Varoufakis.<ref name=Efimerida2013>{{cite web |script-title=el:Βαρουφάκης στο iefimerida.gr: Είμαι απαισιόδοξος για την πορεία της Ελλάδας.

Varoufakis's father, Georgios Varoufakis, was an [[Greeks in Egypt|Egyptiote Greek]] (but ultimately originating from [[Rethymno]] in [[Crete]]) who emigrated from [[Cairo]] to Greece in the 1940s, arriving in the midst of the [[Greek Civil War]]. One day, he was "roughed up" by the police and asked to sign a denunciation of communism. In response, he said: "Look I am not a Buddhist, but I would never sign a denunciation of Buddhism".<ref name=hansen>{{cite news|last1=Hansen|first1=Suzy|title=A Finance Minister Fit for a Greek Tragedy?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/magazine/a-finance-minister-fit-for-a-greek-tragedy.html?_r=0|access-date=24 October 2015|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=20 May 2015}}</ref> He therefore ended up spending several years imprisoned on the island of [[Makronisos]], which was used for the political re-education of people who fought on the communist side in the war.<ref name=bft /> After being released in 1950, he completed his university studies and found employment as the personal assistant to the owner of [[Halyvourgiki S.A.|Halyvourgiki]], Greece's biggest steel producer. He is now, at the age of 90, Chairman of Halyvourgiki's Board of Directors.<ref name=bft /><ref name=usb />

Varoufakis's mother, a student at the [[University of Athens]] School of Chemistry at the time she met Georgios, abandoned her conservative background<ref name=Efimerida2013 /> after meeting her husband who was, at the time, allied to [[United Democratic Left]] (EDA). In the mid-1970s Eleni Varoufaki became an activist for the Women's Union of Greece, which promoted gender equality and had been set up by members of [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]].<ref name=bft /> By the early-1980s, the couple had converged politically to the same political centre-left views and engaged with the socialist PASOK.<ref name=Efimerida2013 /> Eleni was elected Deputy Mayor of Palaio Faliro a few years before she died in 2008.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Varoufakis was six years old when the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|military coup d'état of April 1967]] took place. Varoufakis later said that the military junta showed him a "sense of what it means to be both unfree and, at once, convinced that the possibilities for progress and improvement are endless". The junta collapsed when Varoufakis was in junior high school.<ref name=beginnings>{{cite web|last1=Varoufakis|first1=Yanis|title=Beginnings: From the dictatorship of the Colonels to the tyranny of economics|url=http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/about/beginnings-from-the-dictatorship-of-the-colonels-to-the-tyranny-of-economics/|website=Yanis Varoufakis|access-date=24 October 2015}}</ref> Attending the private [[Moraitis School]], Varoufakis decided early to spell his first name with one 'n', rather than the standard two, for "[[aesthetic]]" reasons. When his teacher gave him a low mark for that, he became angry and has continued spelling his first name with one 'n' ever since.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Christides|first1=Giorgos|title=Profile: Yanis Varoufakis, Greek bailout foe|url=http://m.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31452402|work=BBC|date=13 February 2015}}</ref>

Varoufakis finished his secondary education around 1976, when his parents deemed it too dangerous for him to continue his education in Greece. Therefore, he moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1978 where he entered the [[University of Essex]]. His "initial urge was to study physics" but he decided that "the lingua franca of political discourse was economics". He therefore enrolled in the economics course at Essex, but it has also been suggested that he decided to enroll in economics after meeting [[Andreas Papandreou]].<ref name=bft>{{cite news|last1=Barber|first1=Tony|last2=Hope|first2=Kerin|title=Yanis Varoufakis, Greek finance minister|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e449635a-ad3a-11e4-a5c1-00144feab7de.html|access-date=24 October 2015|work=The Financial Times|date=6 February 2014}}</ref> After only a few weeks of lectures, Varoufakis switched his degree to mathematics.<ref name=beginnings /> Whilst at the University of Essex he joined a variety of political organisations including ComSoc (the University Communist Society) and the [[Troops Out Movement]], which campaigned for a British withdrawal from [[Northern Ireland]]. He also became involved with the [[African National Congress]], [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], and other organisations such as those in solidarity with [[Chile]]. Varoufakis was also elected as secretary of the Black Students Alliance, a choice that caused some controversy, given that he is not black, to which he responded by telling them, according to his PhD supervisor Monojit Chatterjee, "that black was a political term and, as a Greek, on the grounds of ethnicity he had as much reason to be there as anyone else."<ref name=usb>{{cite news|last1=Usborne|first1=Simon|title=Yanis Varoufakis: The Finance Minister who cooks a mean Thai meal, chats about art, and shoots hoops|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/yanis-varoufakis-the-finance-minister-who-cooks-a-mean-thai-meal-chats-about-art-and-shoots-hoops-10021859.html|access-date=24 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=3 February 2015}}</ref> Varoufakis also took part in student debates, where one of his rivals was [[John Bercow]], who later became the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].<ref name=usb />

He moved to the [[University of Birmingham]] in October 1981, obtaining an [[Master of Science|MSc]] in [[mathematical statistics]] in October 1982. He completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[economics]] in 1987 writing a thesis on Optimization and Strikes, back at the University of Essex, where his PhD supervisor was Monojit Chatterji.<ref name="IT ALL BEGAN WITH A STRANGE EMAIL">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/it-all-began-with-a-strange-email/|title=IT ALL BEGAN WITH A STRANGE EMAIL|last1=Varoufakis|first1=Yanis|website=Valve Economics|publisher=Valve|access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref>

==Academic career==
[[File:Yanis Varoufakis on Subversive Festival.jpg|thumb|right|Varoufakis at [[Subversive Festival]] 2013 in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]]]

Between 1982 and 1988, Varoufakis taught economics and econometrics at the [[University of Essex]] and the [[University of East Anglia]], and also taught at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He did not wish to return to Greece for fear of conscription, and so accepted an offer to lecture at the [[University of Sydney]], where he remained until 2000. From 1989 to 2000, he taught as senior lecturer in economics at the Department of Economics of the University of Sydney, with short stints at the [[University of Glasgow]] and the [[UCLouvain|University of Louvain]] (UCLouvain). Varoufakis, during his time in Sydney, had his own slot on a local television show where he was critical of [[John Howard]]'s conservative government. He also acquired Australian citizenship.<ref name=bft /><ref name=acpath />

In 2000, a combination of "nostalgia and abhorrence of the conservative turn of the land Down Under", led Varoufakis to return to Greece where he was unanimously elected an associate professor of economic theory at the [[University of Athens]].<ref name=bft /> In 2002, Varoufakis established ''The University of Athens Doctoral Program in Economics'' (UADPhilEcon), which he directed until 2008. In 2005 he was promoted to full professor of economic theory.<ref name=acpath>{{cite web|last1=Varoufakis|first1=Yanis|title=Early academic path: From England to Australia to Greece|url=http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/about/early-academic-path-from-england-to-australia-to-greece/|website=Yanis Varoufakis|access-date=24 October 2015}}</ref>

From January 2004 to December 2006, Varoufakis served as economic advisor to [[George Papandreou]], of whose government he was to become an ardent critic a few years later.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/finmin-gr-idUSL6N0V742820150128 Reuters (2015-01-28): Profile: Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis]: "Varoufakis was an adviser to former centre-left Prime Minister George Papandreou until he resigned in 2006."

Beginning in March 2012, Varoufakis became economist-in-residence at [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]. He researched the [[virtual economy]] on the Steam digital delivery platform, specifically looking at exchange rates and trade deficits. In June 2012, he began a blog about his research at Valve. In February 2013 his function at Valve was to work on a game for predicting trends in gaming.<ref name=Twitter /><ref name=ValueBlog /><ref name=Forbes /><ref name=FT /> From January 2013 he taught at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as a visiting professor. In November 2013, he was appointed guest professor at Stockholm University, Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, to work within game and decision theory at the Institutionen för data- och systemvetenskap (DSV) centre eGovLab at [[Stockholm University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsv.su.se/en/research/profilearea/egov/yanis-varoufakis-will-be-guest-professor-at-dsv-1.152364|title=Yanis Varoufakis will be guest professor at DSV - DSV, Department of Computer and Systems Sciences - Stockholm University|first=Jannecke|last=Schulman|website=dsv.su.se|access-date=22 March 2018}}</ref> In 2013, he was appointed the Athens desk editor of the online magazine ''WDW Review'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wdwreview.org/|title=WdW Review|work=wdwreview.org}}</ref> in which he contributed until January 2015. On 22 January 2015,{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} the [[International University College of Turin]] awarded to Varoufakis an honorary professorship in comparative law economics and finance for his extraordinary theoretical contribution to the understanding of the global economic crisis.{{r|iuct}} Varoufakis is a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2015.

==Minister of Finance and the Syriza government (January–August 2015)==
{{Greek economic crisis}}
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2021}}
Varoufakis was elected to the Greek parliament, gathering the largest number of votes (more than 142 thousand) of any Greek MP, representing [[Syriza]],{{r|guardiansyriza}} and took office in the new government of [[Alexis Tsipras]] two days later, on 27 January 2015.{{r|ibtimes}} He was appointed [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Finance Minister]] by Tsipras shortly after the election victory. The party promised to renegotiate Greece's debt and significantly curtail the austerity measures which had led to the longest recession in post-war global history.{{r|bbcreduce}}{{r|wsjreduce}}

The new government had to negotiate an extension on its loan agreement, due to expire on 28 February 2015. On 4 February 2015, the ECB lifted the waiver affecting marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by Greece that until then allowed Greek banks to benefit from cheap liquidity. As a result of this decision, Greek banks, already strained by the run on deposits, had to depend on Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), which is, however, significantly more expensive than regular ECB financing. When the ECB raised the provision of ELA very modestly by 3.3 billion euro on 18 February 2015 (when outflows of deposits from Greek banks were reaching record heights), everybody knew that this was an ultimatum: either Greece should strike an agreement within days or it would have to face very serious bank problems. As in the cases of Ireland and Cyprus crises, the ELA was again used as pressure to bring about a quick agreement.Had the EU loan agreement expired without renewal, the [[European Central Bank]] would have pulled its liquidity provisions from Greece's commercial banks, ensuring that they closed their doors to the public. Varoufakis led this negotiation at the Eurogroup and with the [[International Monetary Fund]]. On 20 February, at the Eurogroup, an agreement to extend the Greek loan "facility" for four months, until 30 June 2015, was struck and Varoufakis hailed it as crucial – because it represented a fresh start by specifying that the terms of the loan would be renegotiated and its conditions would be re-drawn on the basis of a new list of reforms to be provided by the Greek government. That list was submitted by Varoufakis on 23 February and was approved by the Eurogroup on 24 February. On those grounds, Varoufakis signed the official document by which the loan agreement's expiry date was to be extended from 28 February to 30 June 2015 – a four-month period during which a new agreement was to be negotiated.

This extension was formalized by the third amendment of the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement (MFFA), initially concluded between Greece and EFSF on 15 March 2012. The amendment is clear on two things. It changed the expiry date and also required that the €10.9 billion held by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) to cover potential bank recapitalisation and resolution costs were returned to the EFSF. This sum can now be released to Greece only on request by the ECB (in its capacity as bank supervisor). This means that the first declared goal of the Greek government, i.e. to enter a totally new arrangement and replace the financial-assistance procedures by a “non-technocratic”, political negotiation at high level, was not achieved. The new agreement was an extension of the old one and was governed by the same basic rules and principles. The same happened in the case of the second goal, i.e. to activate a procedure that would lead to some form of debt relief. According to the Eurogroup statement, the Greek authorities reiterated “their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely.” At least in the short term, Greek plans for some form of debt redemption, thus, had to be shelved.

Greece, however, won flexibility regarding the 2015 primary surplus target. This would be modified downwards from its previously agreed level to “take the economic circumstances in 2015 into account.” Regarding old measures, the Greek Government had to revise its promise to cancel many of the austerity measures it heavily criticized since 2010 as an opposition party, agreeing to “refrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions.” In this context, “economic recovery” is broad enough to cover any type of measure agreed upon since 2010. Finally, the agreement endorses the intention of the Greek government to give priority to rule-of-law and state-building reforms by “implementing long overdue reforms to tackle corruption and tax evasion, and improving the efficiency of the public sector.”

Varoufakis's view on Greece's public debt, and the 2010 crisis which began as a result of the Greek government's inability to fund it, was that EU bailouts were attempts to take on the largest loan in history on condition of austerity measures that would shrink the incomes from which old, un-serviceable loans and new bailout debts would have to be repaid. Varoufakis argued that the "bailout" loans of 2010 and 2012, before restructuring the debt properly and putting in place a developmental program (including reforming the oligarchy, creating a development bank and dealing with the banks' non-performing loans) would lead to deeper bankruptcy, a great depression and a harder default in the future. His explanation of why the troika of Greece's lenders (the IMF, the ECB, and the [[European Commission]]) insisted on these bailout loans was that they represented a transfer of losses from the private banks to Greece's and Europe's taxpayers. In his view, the 20 February 2015 Eurogroup agreement that he negotiated, "was an excellent opportunity to move forward."<ref name=blog2 /> However, this view was not shared by the Eurozone countries or the wider financial community. The ECB had prevented the Greek Government from raising money cheaply and had also forced Greek banks to rely on expensive ELA funding. In other words, the Eurozone had signalled that 'strict conditionality' would apply and that Greece would face a Banking collapse if it did not comply.

Thus, the troika of lenders did not agree to let the new Greek government change the previous terms of the agreement or to a debt restructuring. Varoufakis claims that, soon after the extension was granted at the end of February, the troika reneged on its alleged promise to consider a new fiscal and reform program for Greece, demanding of the Greek government that it implement the old one (which the Syriza government was elected to re-write). However, a promise to consider a request can also be a polite way of saying that after due consideration the request will be denied. In March 2015, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' pointed to several tensions between Greece and the other Eurozone countries, saying that some countries feel they have taken the "tough medicine" and the €195 billion owed is not insignificant. Further, they stated other governments have philosophical differences with Varoufakis and his [[Anglosphere]] and [[Keynesian]] leanings. [[Peter Ludlow (historian)|Peter Ludlow]] said Varoufakis and his colleagues "turned instinctively&nbsp;... to the U.K. and the U.S. even before they called on the European Left."<ref name=wsj2 />

In a discussion with Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]] on invitation of U.S. economic think tank [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]], Varoufakis stated on 9 April 2015 that "the Greek state does not have the capacity to develop public assets." Therefore, he announced that his government was "restarting the privatization process." However, unlike the former governments they would insist on establishing [[public–private partnership]]s with the state retaining a minority stake to generate state revenues. They would also require a minimum investment on behalf of the bidder, and "decent working conditions" for workers.<ref>{{Youtube|OY3Qxm6BoUI&t{{=}}52m23s|Yanis Varoufakis and Joseph Stiglitz}}, live stream, 9 April 2015</ref> Varoufakis also said that although the government needed to avoid a [[Government budget balance|primary budget deficit]], the bailout program's target of a surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP was outlandish and should be reduced to no more than 1.5 percent.<ref>{{cite news |title=Greece to restart privatization program: Varoufakis |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-finmin-idUSKBN0N01DB20150409 |date=9 April 2015 |access-date=13 April 2015 |first=Ingrid |last=Melander}}</ref>

After many weeks of negotiations during which the Greek government, often against Varoufakis's advice, made many concessions to the troika of Greece's lenders, no agreement was in sight. One reason was that the members of the troika did not have a unified position. For example, the IMF insisted that the Greek government's demand for a public debt restructure should be granted so that their own money could be returned to them while the other creditors ate the loss, while powerful finance ministers in the Eurogroup (Germany's, for instance) refused this because they did not want to eat the loss. Another alleged reason was that, with elections approaching in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal, various politicians within the EU did not want to see Greece's radical new government emerge as successful though, of course, if Greece had succeeded in paying them back their money they would have been delighted. Moreover, the differences in economic ideology- in particular the ideological opposition to losing money- will have contributed to the lack of progress towards a mutually-agreeable solution- for example one where a beautiful fairy gave everybody lots of money.<ref>{{cite news |title=Greek Debt Crisis: background and developments in 2015 |url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07114#fullreport |date=13 October 2015 |access-date=16 November 2017 |first=Daniel |last=Harari}}</ref>

On 25 June 2015, Varoufakis was presented with an ultimatum in the Eurogroup. It included a fiscal proposal, a reform agenda, and a funding formula that Varoufakis, his government, and several other ministers of finance sitting in the Eurogroup, considered to be non-viable. The next day, the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, called for a referendum on the Eurogroup's proposal on 5 July.
On 27 July, in Brussels, Varoufakis asked for a one month extension. He said, according to his own tape recording of the meeting, 'The question is very simple, there is a proposal by the institutions (i.e. the Troika). The institutions worked very hard to come up with it. We could not bring ourselves to signing it for reasons I have explained, it is up to the Greek people to decide. The suggestion that we’re coming to you with is that a one-month extension is offered of the existing arrangement so as to allow a smooth transition from today to the 6th of July so as to allow the Greek people, in calmness to deliberate, to consider the proposal which is in front of them, and to make a considered judgment on that basis.'
The Irish Finance Minister responded by pointing out that a run of the Greek banks and ATMs had begun. The German representative confirmed that there would be no extension. Greece would face a Banking crisis. It was left to Luis de Guindos to turn down Varoufakis's plea for an extension by pointing out that calling a referendum was scarcely a confidence building measure precisely because the gap between the Greek and the Troika's position was bridgeable. This showed there was no 'contagion risk'. Greece was welcome to destroy itself, nobody else would be affected. Mario Draghi and Christine Lagard, on behalf of the ECB and the IMF respectively, confirmed that Greece was on its own though any other affected party could get help. In other words, Greece, simply by calling the referendum, had lost Institutional support; it was on its own.

On 5 July 2015, the [[2015 Greek bailout referendum|bailout referendum]] took place. Varoufakis had campaigned vigorously in favour of the 'No' vote, against the united support for the 'Yes' of Greece's media. To make his position clear, he declared on television that he would resign as finance minister if Greeks voted 'Yes'.{{r|yes-quit}} The outcome of the vote was a resounding 61.5 percent vote in favour of 'No'. Varoufakis went on television, soon after the result was announced, and declared that the government was determined to honour this new mandate for a different agreement with its creditors. However, a few hours later, Varoufakis resigned. In his resignation statement the following morning he claimed that "other European participants" had expressed a wish for his absence.{{r|neg}} Later he explained that he decided to resign during a meeting with the prime minister, on the night of the referendum, during which he discovered that the prime minister, instead of being energised by the "No" vote, declared to Varoufakis his decision to acquiesce to the troika's terms. Unwilling to sign such a "surrender" document, Varoufakis chose to resign.

His explanation, published later by Harry Lambert, ''[[New Statesman]]'', 13 July 2015, was this: "I'm not going to betray my own view, that I honed back in 2010, that this country must stop extending and pretending, we must stop taking on new loans pretending that we've solved the problem, when we haven't; when we have made our debt even less sustainable on condition of further austerity that even further shrinks the economy; and shifts the burden further onto the have nots, creating a humanitarian crisis. It's something I'm not going to accept, I'm not going to be party to."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2015/07/exclusive-yanis-varoufakis-opens-about-his-five-month-battle-save-greece|title=Exclusive: Yanis Varoufakis opens up about his five month battle to save Greece|first=Harry|last=Lambert|date=13 July 2015|via=New Statesman}}</ref> Yet, the fact is Varoufakis asked twice for an extension from creditors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

In a 16 July teleconference with private investors that was later made public, Varoufakis described a five-month clandestine project he ran as finance minister involving hacking into Greece's independent tax service's computers. The project's goal was to develop a parallel payment system that could be implemented as a contingency plan if the Greek system failed, and was dubbed "Plan B". In it, individuals' private identification numbers were accessed and copied to a computer controlled by a "childhood friend" of Varoufakis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d44a92c0-3454-11e5-bdbb-35e55cbae175.html|title=Yanis Varoufakis defends 'Plan B' tax hack|first=Peter|last=Spiegel|date=27 July 2015|via=Financial Times}}</ref>

On Friday 14 August, the government (without Varoufakis) pushed successfully through parliament the third Greek bailout agreement. The bailout bill received 222 votes to 64 (as the opposition voted in favour). Up to 40 Syriza members including Varoufakis voted against the bailout.{{r|guardianthrash}} Just prior to that vote, Varoufakis rose in parliament to offer the [[Prime Minister of Greece]] his resignation from his parliamentary seat, saying that this was the only way he knew how to combine his strong opposition to the new bailout with loyalty to the party and the prime minister. On 20 August, the prime minister himself resigned and called a [[September 2015 Greek legislative election|snap election]] due to the loss of support from rebelling [[Syriza]] MPs.{{r|quit}} Varoufakis had already declared that he was not interested in standing again for Syriza. At the same time, Syriza announced that any MP who voted against the bailout package would not be standing for the party. Varoufakis did not go on to represent [[Popular Unity (Greece)|Popular Unity]], unlike many of his ex-Syriza colleagues, as he considered the party too [[isolationism|isolationist]]. Varoufakis chose not to stand in the election, saying he would focus on creating a European network that would 'restor[e] democracy' in Europe.{{r|network}} A month later, the national election was held and despite a low voter turnout, Tsipras and his Syriza Party won just over 35 percent of the vote. Combining with the [[Independent Greeks|Independent Greeks Party]], a majority was achieved and Tsipras was returned to power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34307795|title=Greece election: Alexis Tsipras hails 'victory of the people'|work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Commentary on appointment===
The [[Adam Smith Institute]], a leading [[free-market]] [[think tank]] in the [[United Kingdom]], "enthusiastically" supported Varoufakis's debt-swap plan and asked the then British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to support it. Varoufakis had proposed debt swap measures, including bonds pegged to economic growth, which would replace the existing bonds of the European bailout programme.<ref name="City A.M.">{{cite web|first=Guy |last=Bentley|title=Adam Smith Institute calls on Osborne to back Varoufakis's Greek debt-swap plan|url=http://www.cityam.com/208589/adam-smith-institute-calls-osborne-back-varoufakiss-greek-debt-swap-plan |work=cityam.com|quote=Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has found an enthusiastic backer for his debt restructuring plans in one of Britain's premier free-market think-tanks.}}</ref>

== Later political career (2015–present) ==
In September 2015, Varoufakis appeared on the British topical debate show, ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', and was praised for his performance by Mark Lawson in ''[[The Guardian]]'', who wrote: "several of the sentences he spoke in a second language were more impressive than most that his fellow panellists managed in their native tongue."<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/sep/25/question-time-review-yanis-varoufakis-wins-the-audience-vote|title = Question Time review – Yanis Varoufakis wins the audience vote|last = Lawson|first = Mark|date = 25 September 2015|work = The Guardian|access-date = 17 January 2016}}</ref> He appeared on the show again in October 2016<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-department-staffed-by-people-of-very-low-iq_uk_58094e2ae4b056572d81ff81|title = Brexit dept. staffed by people of "very low IQ" says Varoufakis|last = Gill|first = Martha|date = 21 October 2016|work = Huffington Post UK|access-date = 17 November 2017}}</ref> and March 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Morris |first1=James |title=Theresa May's Brexit deal is 'the kind a nation signs after defeat at war,' economist Yanis Varoufakis says |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-news-latest-theresa-mays-deal-is-the-kind-a-nation-signs-after-defeat-at-war-economist-yanis-a4103906.html |access-date=30 March 2019 |work=Evening Standard |date=29 March 2019}}</ref>

Varoufakis attended an event in London hosted by ''The Guardian'' on 23 October 2015, where he spoke about the UK's upcoming [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|European Union membership referendum]]. He said that the UK should remain in the EU, but also campaign to democratise it: "My message is simple yet rich: those of us who disdain the democratic deficit in Brussels, those of us who detest the authoritarianism of a technocracy which is incompetent and contemptuous of democracy, those of us who are most critical of Europe have a moral duty to stay in Europe, fight for it, and democratise it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/24/eu-referendum-yanis-varoufakis-says-britons-should-vote-to-stay-in-union|title=EU referendum: Yanis Varoufakis says Britons should vote to stay in union|last=Keenan|first=John|date=24 October 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref> He would return to the UK, in May 2016, in the final stages of the campaigning to again urge a remain vote.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/yanis-varoufakis-tour-urging-leftwingers-vote-stay-eu|title=Yanis Varoufakis to join tour urging leftwingers to vote to stay in EU|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=16 May 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 November 2017}}</ref>
On 9 February 2016, Varoufakis launched the [[Democracy in Europe Movement 2025]] (DiEM25) at the [[Volksbühne]] in [[Berlin]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/10/yanis-varoufakis-launches-pan-european-leftwing-movement-diem25|title=Yanis Varoufakis launches pan-European leftwing movement DiEM25|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|date=10 February 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref>

In March 2016, Varoufakis publicly supported the idea of a [[basic income]].<ref name=":0" /> On 2 April 2016, in reaction to tension between German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and the IMF, Varoufakis said there was underway "an attrition war between a reasonably numerate villain (the IMF) and a chronic procrastinator (Berlin)" as to Greek debt relief.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.basicincome.org/news/2016/04/basic-income-essential-approach-varoufakis/|title=Varoufakis: Basic income is an essential approach for social democracy|date=4 April 2016}}</ref>

In March 2018, Varoufakis announced the launch of his own political party, MeRA 25, with a stated aim of freeing Greece from "debt bondage". He stated that he hoped the party would be based on an alliance of "people of the left and liberalism, greens and feminists".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/26/greece-ex-minister-yanis-varoufakis-launches-political-party |title=Greek ex-minister Yanis Varoufakis launches political party |last=Smith |first=Helena |date=26 March 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=28 March 2018}}</ref> The party, whose name stands for "European Realistic Disobedience Front", is affiliated to DiEM25.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/01/yanis-varoufakis-greece-is-a-debtors-prison-new-party-mera25 |title=Yanis Varoufakis: 'Greece is a debtors' prison' |last=Smith |first=Helena |date=1 April 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=1 April 2018}}</ref>

On 20 August 2018, in an on-stage book festival interview in Edinburgh, Varoufakis pressed [[Jeremy Corbyn]], head of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], to "be a bit more ambitious" and become involved in the international progressive movement, saying "We need a progressive international".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16589081.corbyn-urged-to-create-international-left-wing-alliance-to-counter-steve-bannon/|title=Corbyn urged to create international left-wing alliance to counter Steve Bannon|last=Grant|first=Alistair|date=2018-08-21|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=DiEM25.official|title=Jeremy Corbyn with Yanis Varoufakis at the Edinburgh Book Festival, August 20, 2018 {{!}} DiEM25|date=2018-09-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLLoSzNn6xg&t=2091|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref> On 13 September, Varoufakis penned an op-ed piece in ''The Guardian'' about the need for an international progressive movement,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2018/sep/13/our-new-international-movement-will-fight-rising-fascism-and-globalists|title=Our new international movement will fight rising fascism and globalists {{!}} Yanis Varoufakis|last=Varoufakis|first=Yanis|date=2018-09-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> alongside a similar piece by fellow progressive U.S. Senator [[Bernie Sanders]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2018/sep/13/bernie-sanders-international-progressive-front|title=A new authoritarian axis demands an international progressive front {{!}} Bernie Sanders|last=Sanders|first=Bernie|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> On 26 October in Rome, Varoufakis announced the [[Progressive International]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progressive-international.org/|title=Progressives International|language=en}}</ref> which was described as a "common blueprint for an International [[New Deal]], a progressive New [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]]".

=== Re-election ===
On 7 July 2019, his party [[MeRA25]] passed the threshold necessary to enter the Greek parliament and Varoufakis was re-elected an MP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsit.gr/politikh/apotelesmata-eklogon-2019-mera25-aytoi-einai-oi-ennea-vouleytes-pou-eklegontai-6/2827952/|title=Election results|date=10 July 2019|website=newsit.gr}}</ref>

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Varoufakis signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as "a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world" and endorsed him in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 UK general election]].<ref name="nme">{{cite news |last=Neale|first=Matthew|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/new-letter-supporting-jeremy-corbyn-2568734|title=Exclusive: New letter supporting Jeremy Corbyn signed by Roger Waters, Robert Del Naja and more |work=[[NME]]|date=16 November 2019|access-date=27 November 2019}}</ref> In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election.

==Works==
Varoufakis is the author of several books on the European debt crisis, the financial imbalance in the world and [[game theory]]. He is also a recognised speaker and often appears as an analyst for national news media.

A [[Adults in the Room|film]] based on his book ''Adults in the Room'' directed by [[Costa-Gavras]] was released in 2019. Varoufakis himself is portrayed by actor [[Christos Loulis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7493370/ | title=Adults in the Room (2019) }}</ref>

===''A Modest Proposal''===
In November 2010, he and [[Stuart Holland]], a former British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP and economics professor at the [[University of Coimbra]] (Portugal), published ''A Modest Proposal,'' a set of economic policies aimed at overcoming the euro crisis.<ref>Yanis Varoufakis: ''[http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/euro-crisis/ Euro Crisis]''</ref>

In 2013, Version 4.0 of ''A Modest Proposal'' appeared with the American economist [[James K. Galbraith]] as a third co-author. This version was published in late 2013 in French with a supporting foreword by [[Michel Rocard]], former Prime Minister of France. {{As of|2011|9|since=y}}, ''Truman Factor'' features select articles by Varoufakis in English and in Spanish.<ref>[[Russell Shorto]]: ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/the-way-greeks-live-now.html?_r=2&exprod=myyahoo&pagewanted=all The Way Greeks Live Now].''

===''The Global Minotaur''===
{{nosources|section|date=November 2021}}
First published in 2011, ''The Global Minotaur'' constructs a historical narrative and metaphor which Varoufakis uses to describe the world economy from the mid-1970s to the 2008 crash and beyond. He argues that the global economy since the 1970s can be viewed as being built around the financing of the twin deficits of the United States – its trade deficit and government deficit. Varoufakis argues that the United States powered the global economy by consuming the exports of the rest of the world, and then the surpluses flowed back to the United States by going to institutions on Wall Street or being used to buy U.S. Treasury debt. He suggests the recycling back to the U.S. happened naturally due to the status of the dollar as the global reserve currency, and because of the profitability of U.S. corporations and returns on Wall Street. However, when the U.S. economy and banking system faltered in 2008, the United States' ability to consume vast quantities of imports decreased, and investing in Wall Street became a much less inviting prospect, so the system seized up. This explains why the 2008 recession was felt so heavily around the world. The metaphor of the Minotaur is used as Varoufakis characterizes the flows back to the U.S. as a "tribute" to a great power.
