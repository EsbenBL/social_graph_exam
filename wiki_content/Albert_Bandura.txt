'''Albert Bandura''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|n|ˈ|d|ʊər|ə}}; December 4, 1925 – July 26, 2021) was a Canadian-American psychologist who was the Professor in Psychology at [[Stanford University]].<ref name="NMS">{{cite web |title=The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation |url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.jsp;jsessionid=BE39298B1DCA7AAE1BE91E2A333345E2?recip_id=5300000000505 |website=www.nsf.gov |access-date=October 14, 2021}}</ref>

Bandura was responsible for contributions to the field of education and to several fields of psychology, including [[social cognitive theory]], [[therapy]], and [[personality psychology]], and was also of influence in the transition between [[behaviorism]] and [[cognitive psychology]]. He is known as the originator of [[social learning theory]] (renamed the social cognitive theory) and the theoretical construct of [[self-efficacy]], and is also responsible for the influential 1961 [[Bobo doll experiment]]. This Bobo doll experiment demonstrated the concept of [[observational learning]].

A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Jean Piaget]]<ref>Haggbloom S.J. (2002).

==Early life==
Bandura was born in [[Mundare]], Alberta, an open town of roughly four hundred inhabitants, as the youngest child, and only son, in a family of six. The limitations of education in a remote town such as this caused Bandura to become independent and self-motivated in terms of learning, and these primarily developed traits proved very helpful in his lengthy career.<ref>"Bandura, Albert." ''Psychologists and Their Theories for Students''. Ed. Kristine Krapp. Vol. 1. Detroit: Gale, 2005. 39–66. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 3 Apr. 2012.</ref> Bandura was of Polish and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] descent; his father was from Kraków, Poland whilst his mother was from Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ALBERT BANDURA Biography {{!}} Psychologist {{!}} Social Psychology {{!}} Stanford University {{!}} California|url=https://albertbandura.com/albert-bandura-biography.html|access-date=2021-06-22|website=albertbandura.com}}</ref>

Bandura's parents were a key influence in encouraging him to seek ventures out of the small hamlet they resided in. The summer after finishing high school, Bandura worked in the [[Yukon]] to protect the [[Alaska Highway]] against sinking. Bandura later credited his work in the northern [[tundra]] as the origin of his interest in human [[psychopathology]]. It was in this experience in the Yukon, where he was exposed to a subculture of drinking and gambling, which helped broaden his perspective and scope of views on life.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ALBERT BANDURA Biography {{!}} Psychologist {{!}} Social Psychology {{!}} Stanford University {{!}} California|url=https://albertbandura.com/albert-bandura-biography.html|access-date=2021-06-22|website=albertbandura.com}}</ref>

Bandura arrived in the US in 1949 and was naturalized in 1956. He married Virginia Varns (1921&ndash;2011) in 1952,<ref name=varnsobit>[http://www.paloaltoonline.com/obituaries/memorials/virginia-belle-bandura?o=1489 "Virginia Belle Bandura, Dec. 6, 1921 - Oct. 10, 2011, Stanford, California"] at ''Lasting Memories: An online directory of obituaries and remembrances of Mid-peninsula Residents''. (accessed 6 December 2012)</ref> and they raised two daughters, Carol and Mary.<ref>{{cite web | title = Marquis biographies online: Profile detail, Albert Bandura | url = http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002238841 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | access-date = August 6, 2012}}</ref>

== Education and academic career ==
Bandura's introduction to academic psychology arrived by a fluke; as a student with little to do in early mornings, he took a psychology course in order to pass the time and became passionate about the subject. Bandura graduated in three years, in 1949, with a B.A. from the [[University of British Columbia]], winning the Bolocan Award in psychology, and then moved to the then-epicenter of theoretical psychology, the [[University of Iowa]], from where he obtained his M.A. in 1951 and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology in 1952. [[Arthur Lester Benton|Arthur Benton]] was his academic adviser at Iowa,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/banconversion.html |title=See end of page for Bandura's own statement |publisher=Des.emory.edu |access-date=December 30, 2010 |archive-date=June 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615084943/http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/banconversion.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>  giving Bandura a direct academic descent from [[William James]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/bangenealogy.html |title=Bandura's Professional Genealogy |publisher=Des.emory.edu |access-date=December 30, 2010 |archive-date=May 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509082218/http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/bangenealogy.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>  while [[Clark Hull]] and [[Kenneth Spence]] were influential collaborators. During his Iowa years, Bandura came to support a style of psychology that sought to investigate psychological phenomena through repeatable, experimental testing. His inclusion of such mental phenomena as imagery and [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and his concept of [[reciprocal determinism]], which postulated a relationship of mutual influence between an agent and its environment, marked a radical departure from the dominant behaviorism of the time. Bandura's expanded array of conceptual tools allowed for more potent modeling of such phenomena as observational learning and self-regulation, and provided psychologists with a practical way in which to theorize about mental processes, in opposition to the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] constructs of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[personality psychology]].<ref name="webspace.ship.edu"/>

=== Post-doctoral work ===

Upon graduation, he completed his postdoctoral internship at the Wichita Guidance Center.  The following year, 1953, he accepted a teaching position at [[Stanford University]], which he held until becoming professor emeritus in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-Bandura |title=Albert Bandura |publisher=Britannica |access-date=2021-03-11}}</ref> In 1974, he was elected president of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), which is the world's largest association of psychologists.<ref name=AAAS /> Bandura would later state the only reason he agreed to be in the running for the APA election was because he wanted his 15 minutes of fame without any intentions of being elected. He also worked as a sports coach.<ref>{{cite book | editor1 = M. G. Lindzey |editor2= W. M. Runyan | title = A history of psychology in autobiography (vol IX) | url =http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/BanduraAutobiography2007.html | access-date = August 6, 2012 }}</ref>

== Research ==
Bandura was initially influenced by Robert Sears' work on familial antecedents of [[social behavior]] and identificatory learning and gave up his research of the psychoanalytic theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grusec|first=J. E.|date=2020-07-21|title=Social Learning Theory and Developmental Psychology: The Legacies of Robert Sears and Albert Bandura|url=http://ijds-journal.com/index.php/home/article/view/30|journal=International Journal of Developmental Sciences|language=en|volume=14|issue=05|pages=67–88|issn=2191-7485}}</ref> He directed his initial research to the role of social [[Modeling (psychology)|modeling]] in human [[motivation]], thought, and action. In collaboration with Richard Walters, his first doctoral student, he engaged in studies of [[Social learning theory|social learning]] and [[aggression]]. Their joint efforts illustrated the critical role of modeling in human behavior and led to a program of research into the determinants and mechanisms of [[observational learning]].

=== Social learning theory ===
{{Main|Social learning theory}}
[[File:Sonny Fox, Bill Ryerson and Albert Bandura speaking at a Stanford Conference in 2018.jpg|alt=Albert Bandura speaking on Social Learning Theory and Entertainment-Education at Stanford University in March 2015.|thumb|Albert Bandura speaking on [[Social learning theory|Social Learning Theory]] and [[Entertainment-Education]] at [[Stanford University]] in March 2015.]]
The initial phase of Bandura's research analyzed the foundations of human learning and the willingness of children and adults to imitate behavior observed in others, in particular, aggression.

He found that according to Social Learning theory, models are an important source for learning new behaviors and for achieving behavioral change in institutionalized settings.<ref>Henry P Sims Jr. & Charles C Manz (1982): Social Learning Theory, Journal of Organizational Behavior Management, 3:4, 55–63.</ref>

Social learning theory posits that there are three regulatory systems that control behavior. First, the antecedent inducements greatly influence the time and response of behavior. The stimulus that occurs before the behavioral response must be appropriate in relation to social context and performers. Second, response feedback influences also serve an important function. Following a response, the reinforcements, by experience or observation, will greatly impact the occurrence of the behavior in the future. Third, the importance of cognitive functions in social learning. For example, for aggressive behavior to occur some people become easily angered by the sight or thought of individuals with whom they have had hostile encounters, and this memory is acquired through the learning process.<ref>Bandura, A. (1973). Aggression: A social learning analysis. Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice-Hall.</ref>

Social learning theory became one of the theoretical frameworks for [[Entertainment-Education]], a method of creating socially beneficial entertainment pioneered by [[Miguel Sabido]]. Bandura and Sabido went on to forge a close relationship and further refine the theory and practice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofchange.com/albert-bandura-the-power-of-soap-operas-video/|title=Albert Bandura: The Power of Soap Operas [Video]Albert Bandura: The Power of Soap Operas [Video] - Cinema of Change|date=2017-12-13|website=www.cinemaofchange.com|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref>

===Aggression===
{{See also|Moral disengagement}}

His research with Walters led to his first book, ''Adolescent Aggression'' in 1959, and to a subsequent book, ''Aggression: A Social Learning Analysis'' in 1973. During a period dominated by behaviorism in the mold of [[B.F. Skinner]], Bandura believed the sole behavioral modifiers of [[Reinforcement|reward]] and [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]] in [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]] were inadequate as a framework, and that many human behaviors were learned from other humans. Bandura began to analyze the means of treating unduly aggressive children by identifying sources of violence in their lives. Initial research in the area had begun in the 1940s under [[Neal Miller]] and [[John Dollard]]; his continued work in this line eventually culminated in the [[Bobo doll experiment]], and in 1977's hugely influential treatise, ''[[Social Learning Theory]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/bandura.htm |title=Albert Bandura |publisher=Criminology.fsu.edu |date=November 30, 1998 |access-date=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411215231/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/bandura.htm |archive-date=2011-04-11 }}</ref> Many of his innovations came from his focus on empirical investigation and reproducible investigation, which were alien to a field of [[psychology]] dominated by the theories of Freud.

In 1961 Bandura conducted a controversial experiment known as the [[Bobo doll experiment]], designed to show that similar behaviors were learned by individuals shaping their own behavior after the actions of models. Bandura's results from this experiment changed the course of modern psychology,<ref name="psychology.about.com">[http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/self_efficacy.htm Cherry, Kendra. "Self Efficacy: Why Believing In Yourself Is So Important." What Is Self-Efficacy? 2015. Web. 28 May 2015.]</ref> and were widely credited with helping shift the focus in academic psychology from pure [[behaviorism]] to [[cognitive psychology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bandura and Bobo|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/bandura-and-bobo.html|access-date=2021-03-09|website=Association for Psychological Science - APS|language=en-US}}</ref> Moreover, the Bobo doll experiment emphasized how young individuals are influenced by the acts of adults. When the adults were praised for their aggressive behavior, the children were more likely to keep on hitting the doll. However, when the adults were punished, they consequently stopped hitting the doll as well. The experiment is among the most lauded and celebrated of psychological experiments.

===Social cognitive theory===
{{Main|Social cognitive theory}}
{{See also|Social cognitive theory of morality}}

By the mid-1980s, Bandura's research had taken a more holistic bent, and his analysis tended towards giving a more comprehensive overview of human cognition in the context of social learning. The theory he expanded from social learning theory soon became known as social cognitive theory.

==== Social foundations of thought and action ====

In 1986, Bandura published ''[[Social Foundations of Thought and Action|Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory]]'', in which he re-conceptualized individuals as self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting, and self-regulating, in opposition to the orthodox conception of humans as governed by external forces. He advanced concepts of [[Reciprocal determinism|triadic reciprocal causation]], which determined the connections between human behavior, environmental factors, and personal factors such as cognitive, affective, and biological events, and of [[reciprocal determinism]], governing the causal relations between such factors. Bandura's emphasis on the capacity of agents to self-organize and self-regulate would eventually give rise to his later work on self-efficacy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Betz|first=Nancy E.|date=June 2004|title=Contributions of Self-Efficacy Theory to Career Counseling: A Personal Perspective|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/j.2161-0045.2004.tb00950.x|journal=The Career Development Quarterly|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=340–353|doi=10.1002/j.2161-0045.2004.tb00950.x}}</ref>

=== Self-efficacy ===
{{Main|Self-efficacy}}
In 1963, he published ''Social Learning and Personality Development.'' In 1974, [[Stanford University]] awarded him an endowed chair and he became David Starr Jordan Professor of Social Science in Psychology. In 1977, he published ''Social Learning Theory'', a book that altered the direction psychology took in the 1980s.<ref name="psychology.about.com"/>
 
While investigating the processes by which modeling alleviates [[phobia|phobic]] disorders in snake-phobics, he found that [[self-efficacy]] beliefs (which the phobic individuals had in their own capabilities to alleviate their phobia) mediated changes in behavior and in fear-arousal. He launched a major program of research examining the influential role of self-referent thought in psychological functioning. Although he continued to explore and write on theoretical problems relating to myriad topics, from the late 1970s he devoted much attention to exploring the role of self-efficacy beliefs in human functioning.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Self-Efficacy Theory {{!}} Simply Psychology|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-efficacy.html#:~:text=Psychologist%20Albert%20Bandura%20has%20defined%20self-efficacy%20as%20people%27s,the%20foundation%20for%20motivation,%20well-being,%20and%20personal%20accomplishment.|access-date=2021-03-09|website=www.simplypsychology.org}}</ref>

In 1986 he published ''[[Social Foundations of Thought and Action|Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory]]'', a book in which he offered a social cognitive theory of human functioning that accords a central role to cognitive, vicarious, self-regulatory and self-reflective processes in human adaptation and change. This theory has its roots in an agentic perspective that views people as self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting and self-regulating, not just as reactive organisms shaped by [[Natural environment|environmental]] forces or driven by inner impulses. His book, ''[[Self-efficacy: The exercise of control]]'' was published in 1997.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bandura|first=Albert|title=Self-efficacy: the exercise of control|date=1997|isbn=978-0-7167-2626-5|language=en|oclc=36074515}}</ref>

== Bandura on education ==

Bandura's [[social learning theory]] contributes to students and teachers within the field of education. In 1986, Bandura changed the name of the social learning theory to [[social cognitive theory]].<ref name=Grusec>Grusec, J.E. (1992). "Social learning theory and developmental psychology: The legacies of Robert Sears and Albert Bandura". ''Developmental Psychology, 28'' (5), 776-786.</ref> The social cognitive theory still focuses on how behavior and growth are affected by the cognitive operations that occur during social activities.<ref name="Grusec"/> The key theoretical components of the social cognitive theory that are applied in education are [[self-efficacy]], [[self-regulated learning|self-regulation]], [[observational learning]], and [[reciprocal determinism]].

The social cognitive theory can be applied to motivation and learning for students and teachers.<ref name=Golas>Golas, J. (2010. "Effective teacher preparation programs: Bridging the gap between educational technology availability and its utilization".
