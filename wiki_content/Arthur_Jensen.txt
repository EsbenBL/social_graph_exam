'''Arthur Robert Jensen''' (August 24, 1923&nbsp;– October 22, 2012) was an American psychologist and writer. He was a professor of [[educational psychology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="obit"/><ref name=biography>{{cite journal|url=http://www.edb.utexas.edu/robinson/danr/JEBS%2031(3)%20-06_Jensen%20profile.pdf |title=Arthur Jensen |journal=Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics |access-date=2010-06-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401053715/http://www.edb.utexas.edu/robinson/danr/JEBS%2031%283%29%20-06_Jensen%20profile.pdf |archive-date=2010-04-01 }}</ref>  Jensen was known for his work in [[psychometrics]] and [[differential psychology]], the study of how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.

He was a major proponent of the [[hereditarianism|hereditarian]] position in the [[nature and nurture]] debate, the position that [[genetics]] play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[personality psychology|personality]]. He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals<ref name="JensenCollectedWorks2015">{{cite web |url=http://arthurjensen.net/?page_id=9 |title=Collected works |newspaper=Arthurjensen.net |access-date= August 30, 2015}}</ref> and sat on the editorial boards of the [[scientific journals]] ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' and ''[[Personality and Individual Differences]]''.<ref>''Intelligence''[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/620195/editorialboard] and ''Personality and Individual Differences''[http://authors.elsevier.com/JournalDetail.html?PubID=603&Precis=EB] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028165418/http://authors.elsevier.com/JournalDetail.html?PubID=603&Precis=EB |date=2002-10-28 }} publisher's pages.</ref>

==Early life==
Jensen was born August 24, 1923, in [[San Diego]], California, the son of Linda Mary (née Schachtmayer) and Arthur Alfred Jensen, who operated and owned a lumber and building materials company.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_kZAAAAYAAJ&q=Linda+Mary+Schachtmayer |title=Current biography yearbook |publisher=H.W.

As a child, Jensen was interested in [[herpetology]] and [[classical music]], playing [[clarinet]] in the [[San Diego Symphony]] orchestra.<ref name=alex-forsythe-key-thinkers-in-individual-difference>{{cite book |last= Forsythe|first= Alex |date= 28 May 2019|title= Key Thinkers in Individual Difference |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2QWdDwAAQBAJ&q=978-1-138-49415-2&pg=PA143 |location= Oxon |publisher= Routledge |pages = 143–150 |isbn= 978-1-138-49415-2}}</ref>

Jensen received a B.A. in psychology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1945 and went on to obtain his M.A. in psychology in 1952 from [[San Diego State College]]. He earned his Ph.D. in [[clinical psychology]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1956 under the supervision of [[Percival Symonds]] on the [[thematic apperception test]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ead.ohiolink.edu/xtf-ead/view?docId=ead/OhAkAHA0520.xml;chunk.id=bioghist_1;brand=default |title=Biography of Arthur R. Jensen |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=OhioLINK Finding Aid Repository |publisher=Ohio EAD Task Force |access-date=August 12, 2021}}</ref> From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the [[University of London]], [[Institute of Psychiatry]] with [[Hans Eysenck]].

Upon returning to the [[United States]], he became a researcher and professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of [[culture]], development, and genetics on intelligence and learning. He received [[tenure]] at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first [[sabbatical]] in 1964. He concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students.

Jensen had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a [[Conducting|conductor]] himself. At 14, he conducted a [[Band (music)|band]] that won a nationwide [[competition|contest]] held in [[San Francisco]]. Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a [[seminar]] given by [[Nikolai Sokoloff]]. Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to [[New York City|New York]], mainly to be near the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]]. He was also deeply interested in the life and example of [[Gandhi]], producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life. During Jensen's period in [[San Diego]] he spent time working as a [[social worker]] with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.

==IQ and academic achievement==
Jensen's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability. ''Level I'', or [[associative learning]], may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills. ''Level II'', or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.

Later, Jensen was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|general factor of intelligence]], a concept which was essentially synonymous with his ''Level II'' conceptual learning. The general factor, or ''g'', is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.

Jensen claimed, on the basis of his research, that [[Heritability of IQ|general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait]], determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions. He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.

Jensen's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'', was titled "[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]]" It concluded, among other things, that [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]] programs designed to boost [[African-American]] [[IQ]] scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.<ref name="High">{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p652y1977-78.pdf |title=High Impact Science and the Case of Arthur Jensen |date=9 October 1978 |access-date=27 January 2012}}</ref>

The work became one of the most cited papers in the [[history]] of [[psychological testing]] and [[Psychometrics|intelligence research]], although a large number of citations consisted of rebuttals of Jensen's work, or references to it as an example of a controversial paper.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Wendy |title=Developmental Psychology: Revisiting the Classic Studies |editor1-last=Slater |editor1-first=Alan M. |editor2-last=Quinn |editor2-first=Paul C. |chapter=How Much Can We Boost IQ?

After the paper was released, large protests were held, demanding that Jensen be fired. Jensen's car tires were slashed, the university police provided him with plain-clothes bodyguards, and he and his family received threats that were considered so realistic by the police that they temporarily left their house. Jensen was spat on and was prevented from delivering lectures by disruptive protests. The editorial board of the ''Harvard Educational Review'' for a time refused to let him have reprints of his article, and said that they had not solicited the section on racial differences; Jensen later provided correspondence in which the board had requested he do so.<ref name="scarr">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(99)80005-1 |title=On Arthur Jensen's integrity |journal=Intelligence |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=227–232 |year=1998 |last1=Scarr |first1=Sandra }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Nyborg|first1=Helmuth|title=The Scientific Study of General Intelligence: Tribute to Arthur Jensen|date=2003|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080516660|pages=458–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPNFXBnwuNoC&pg=PA458}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Information|first1=Reed Business|title=New Scientist|date=1972|publisher=Reed Business Information|pages=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYqAz8FJbzwC&pg=PA96}}</ref>

In a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:

{{quote|
...nowhere have I "claimed" an "innate deficiency" of intelligence in blacks. My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: "The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations. The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question." (Jensen, 1981a, p. 213).
}}

Although a critic of Jensen's thesis,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|journal=Change|volume=5|issue=4|pages=33–37|jstor=40161749|title=Arthur Jensen and His Critics: The Great IQ Controversy|date=May 1973|quote=Even for one who disagrees, as I do, with the main conclusions of the analysis...|doi=10.1080/00091383.1973.10568506}}</ref> economist [[Thomas Sowell]], criticizing the taboo against research on [[race and intelligence]], wrote:
{{quote|Professor Jensen pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him. He did this because "I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate." What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor Jensen has had.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2002/10/01/race_and_iq?page=full |title=Race and IQ|author=Thomas Sowell|date=October 1, 2002|access-date=14 November 2008}}</ref>}}

However, Jensen's 1998 ''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]'' gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ. In Chapter 12: Population Differences in ''g'': Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes:
{{quote|
The relationship of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e., [[Spearman's hypothesis]]) suggests that the average white-black difference in ''g'' has a biological component. Human races are viewed not as discrete, or [[Platonism|Platonic]], categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly ''g''.

In 2005, Jensen's article, co-written with [[J.

==Assessment==
===Support===

[[Paul E. Meehl]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], after being honored by the APA, wrote that Jensen's "contributions, in both quality and quantity, certainly excelled mine" and that he was "embarrassed" and "distress[ed]" that APA refused to honor Jensen because of his ideology.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meehl|first1=Paul E.|title=PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SCIENTIST: LXXVIII. RELEVANCE OF A SCIENTIST'S IDEOLOGY IN COMMUNAL RECOGNITION OF SCIENTIFIC MERIT|citeseerx=10.1.1.693.3454}}</ref>

[[Sandra Scarr]] of Yale University wrote that Jensen possessed an "uncompromising personal integrity" and set the standard for "honest psychological science". She contrasted him and his work favorably to some of his critics, who she called "politically driven liars, who distort scientific facts in a misguided and condescending effort to protect an impossible myth about human equality".<ref name="scarr" />

Steven J. Haggbloom, writing for ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' in 2002, rated Jensen as one of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, based on six different metrics chosen by Haggbloom.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/e413802005-787|title=The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the Twentieth Century|year=2001|last1=Haggbloom|first1=Steven J.}}</ref>

[[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of DNA, considered that there was "much substance to Jensen's arguments" and that it was "likely that more than half the difference between the average I.Q. of American whites and Negroes is due to genetic reasons, and will not be eliminated by any foreseeable change in the environment."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Francis |first1=Crick |title=Letter from Francis Crick to John T. Edsall, Fogarty International Center |url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/SCBBNM |website=profiles.nlm.nih.gov |language=en |date=22 February 1971}}</ref>

In 1980 Jensen published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, titled ''[[Bias in Mental Testing]]''. Reviewing this book, psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination, saying that he found many of Jensen's opponents to be more politically biased than Jensen was.<ref>K. Kaye, ''The Sciences'', January 1981, pp. 26-28.</ref>

===Criticism===

[[Melvin Konner]] of Emory University, wrote:
{{quote|
Statements made by Arthur Jensen, William Shockley, and other investigators in the late 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions. Many of these statements were proved wrong, but they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence is very difficult to recant.
}}

Lisa Suzuki and [[Joshua Aronson]] of [[New York University]] wrote that Jensen had largely ignored evidence which failed to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent genetic racial differences.<ref>''The cultural malleability of intelligence and its impact on the racial/ethnic hierarchy'' L Suzuki, J Aronson&nbsp;– Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 2005</ref>

Paleontologist and evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticized Jensen's work in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''. Gould writes that Jensen misapplies the concept of "[[heritability]]", which is defined as a measure of the [[Genetic diversity|variation]] of a trait due to inheritance ''within'' a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156–157). According to Gould, Jensen uses heritability to measure differences ''between'' populations.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Gould also disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, ''g'', or "the [[general factor]] common to a large number of cognitive abilities" which can be measured along a unilinear scale. This is a claim most closely identified with [[Charles Spearman]]. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of [[L. L. Thurstone]] to ultimately support this claim; Gould, however, argues that Thurstone's [[factor analysis]] of intelligence revealed ''g'' to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314). Gould criticizes Jensen's sources including his use of [[Catharine Cox]]'s 1926 ''Genetic Studies of Genius'', which examines [[Historiometry|historiometrically]] the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths (Gould 1981: 153–154).

===Neutral responses===

According to [[David Lubinski]] of Vanderbilt University, the "extent to which [Jensen's] work was either admired or reviled by many distinguished scientists is unparalleled."<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/a0032872|pmid = 23895609|title = Arthur R.

After Jensen's death, [[James Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]] of the University of Otago, a prominent advocate of the environmental position, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Jensen was without racial bias and had not initially foreseen that his research would be used to argue for racial supremacy and that his career was "emblematic of the extent to which American scholarship is inhibited by political orthodoxy", though he noted that Jensen shifted towards genetic explanations later in life.<ref name="obit" />

==Jensen's response and criticism==
In Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled ''The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons'',<ref>[http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327023519/http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils |date=March 27, 2006 }}</ref> Jensen begins his paper with this observation:

{{quote|
Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, "Biology as a Social Weapon." Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book. Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of Gould when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist [[Edward O. Wilson]], a leader in the development of sociobiology...
}}

While Jensen recognizes the validity of some of Gould's claims, in many places, he criticizes Gould's general approach:

{{quote|
This charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth. In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the Marxist interpretation of the history of science.
}}

Jensen adds that Gould made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present Jensen's own positions:

{{quote|
In his references to my own work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.
}}

Jensen expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner, [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]]:

{{quote|
Now and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind. His book, ''Race, IQ and Jensen'' (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jensen |first=Arthur |author-link=Arthur Jensen |editor1-last=Modgil |editor1-first=Sohan |editor2-last=Modgil |editor2-first=Celia |title=Arthur Jensen: Consensus and Controversy |date=1987 |publisher=Falmer Press |location=London |series=Falmer international master-minds challenged; 4 |isbn=978-1-85000-093-8 |page=379 |chapter=Chapter 21: Differential Psychology: Towards Consensus }}</ref>

==Books==

=== ''Bias in Mental Testing'' ===
''[[Bias in Mental Testing]]'' (1980) is a book examining the question of test bias in commonly used [[standardized test]]s. The book runs almost 800 pages and has been called "exhaustive" by three researchers who reviewed the field 19 years after the book's publication.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Robert T.|last2=Reynolds|first2=Cecil R.|last3=Whitaker|first3=Jean S.|s2cid=46561407|title=Bias in mental testing since Bias in Mental Testing.|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|volume=14|issue=3|pages=208–238|doi=10.1037/h0089007|year=1999}}</ref> It reviewed in detail the available evidence about [[Intelligence quotient#Test bias|test bias]] across major US racial/ethnic groups. Jensen concluded that "the currently most widely used standardized tests of mental ability -- IQ, scholastic aptitude, and achievement tests -- are, by and large, not biased against any of the native-born English-speaking minority groups on which the amount of research evidence is sufficient for an objective determination of bias, if the tests were in fact biased. For most nonverbal standardized tests, this generalization is not limited to English-speaking minorities." (p. ix). Jensen also published a summary of the book the same year which was a target article in the journal ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' to which 27 commentaries were printed along with the author's reply.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00005161 |title=Précis of Bias in Mental Testing |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=325–333 |year=1980 |last1=Jensen |first1=Arthur R. |s2cid=145366637 }}</ref>

=== ''Straight Talk about Mental Tests'' ===
''Straight Talk about Mental Tests'' (1981) is a book written about psychometrics for the general public.  [[John Bissell Carroll|John B. Carroll]] reviewed it favorably in 1982, saying it was a useful summary of the issues,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/021298 |title=Can We Defuse the IQ Controversy? |journal=Contemporary Psychology: A Journal of Reviews |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=528–529 |year=1982 |last1=Carroll |first1=John B. }}</ref> as did Paul Cline writing for the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0007125000136682 |title=''Straight Talk about Mental Tests''. By Arthur R. Jensen. New York: The Free Press. 1981. Pp 269. $12.95 |first1=Paul |last1=Kline |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=140 |issue=5 |date=May 1982 |pages=544–5 }}</ref> In 2016, [[Richard J. Haier]] called it "a clear examination of all issues surrounding mental testing".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Neuroscience of Intelligence|last=Haier|first=Richard J.|date=2016|isbn=9781316105771|location=New York, NY|oclc=951742581}}</ref>

===''The g Factor''===
''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability|The ''g'' Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]'' (1998) is a book on the [[general intelligence factor]] (''g''). The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.

===''Clocking the Mind''===
''Clocking the Mind: Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences'' (2006) deals with [[mental chronometry]] (MC), and covers the speed with which the brain processes information and different ways this is measured. Jensen argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability, which is in contrast to IQ, which merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties.

Joseph Glicksohn wrote in a 2007 review for ''[[Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology]]'' that "The book should be perused with care in order to ensure the further profitable use of [reaction time] in both experimental and differential lines of research."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/cep2007_2_154 |title=Review of Arthur R. Jensen (2006)--Clocking the mind: Mental chronometry and individual differences |journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=154–158 |year=2007 |last1=Glicksohn |first1=Joseph }}</ref>

[[Douglas K. Detterman|Douglas Detterman]] reviewed it in 2008 for ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'', writing that "the book would make a good introduction to the field of the measurement of individual differences in cognitive tasks for beginning graduate students."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.08.001 |title=Arthur R. Jensen, Clocking the mind: Mental chronometry and individual differences, Elsevier, Oxford (2007) |year=2008 |last1=Detterman |first1=Douglas K. |journal=Intelligence |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=491–493 }}</ref> [[Eric-Jan Wagenmakers]] and [[Han van der Mass]], also writing for ''Intelligence'' in 2018, faulted the book for omitting the work by mathematical psychologists, advocating standardization of chronometric methods (which the authors consider problematic because it can hide method variance), and because it does not discuss topics such as the [[G factor (psychometrics)#Mutualism|mutualism model]] of the ''g-''factor and the [[Flynn effect]]. They describe the book's breadth as useful, despite its simplistic approach.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.09.001 |title=Jensen A.R., Clocking the mind: Mental chronometry and individual differences, Elsevier, Amsterdam (2006) (pp. xi+ 272) |isbn=978-0-08-044939-5|year=2008 |last1=Wagenmakers |first1=Eric-Jan |journal=Intelligence |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=493–494 |last2=Van Der Maas |first2=Han }}</ref> Jensen was on the editorial board of ''Intelligence'' when these reviews were published.

==Awards==
In 2003, Jensen was awarded the [[Kistler Prize]] for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human [[genome]] and human [[society]]. In 2006, the [[International Society for Intelligence Research]] awarded Jensen its Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isironline.org/2006-lifetime-achievement-award/|title=2006 Lifetime Achievement Award|newspaper=isironline.org|publisher=International Society for Intelligence Research|date=December 25, 2006|access-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref>
