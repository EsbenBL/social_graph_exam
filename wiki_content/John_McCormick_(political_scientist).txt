'''John McCormick''' (born November 30, 1954) is [[Jean Monnet Chair]] of [[European Union]] Politics at [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]] (IUPUI), and was department chair from 2001 until 2008. He spent eight years working in the [[environmental movement]] (working for the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]]) before becoming an academic. His research and teaching interests have moved from [[environmental policy]] to [[comparative politics]] and the politics and policies of the [[European Union]].

His 2010 book ''[[Europeanism]]'' is an attempt to pin down the political, economic and social features of Europe and Europeans. It argues that those who focus on the failures of [[European integration]], the mixed record in the achievement of common European policies, and disagreements among European leaders, are missing the bigger picture: that a combination of history and the rise of the [[European Union]] have helped encourage Europeans to develop common positions on a wide range of issues. Europeanism today can be equated with reduced identification with the [[State (polity)|state]], [[secularism]], [[welfarism]], [[cosmopolitanism]], [[communitarianism]], [[multiculturalism]], [[civilian power]], and [[multilateralism]]. His 2013 book ''Why Europe Matters'' makes the case for the European Union, and attempts to address the rising tide of [[euroscepticism]] by outlining the achievements of the European Union in promoting [[peace]], [[democracy]], open markets, and a new approach to [[international relations]].
