Translated from the Italian by [[Michael Hardt]]. (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991). Originally published as ''L'anomalia selvaggia: Saggio su potere e potenza in Baruch Spinoza'' (Milano: Feltrinelli, 1981). Antonio Negri (1981): "This work [''The Savage Anomaly''] was written in prison. And it was also conceived, for the most part, in prison. Certainly, I have always known Spinoza well. Since I was in school, I have loved the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' (and here I would like to fondly remember my teacher of those years). I continued to work on it, never losing touch, but a full study required too much time. [...] Spinoza is the clear and luminous side of Modern philosophy. [...] With Spinoza, philosophy succeeds for the first time in negating itself as a science of mediation. In Spinoza there is the sense of a great anticipation of the future centuries; there is the intuition of such a radical truth of future philosophy that it not only keeps him from being flattened onto seventeenth-century thought but also, it often seems, denies any confrontation, any comparison. Really, none of his contemporaries understands him or refutes him. [...] Spinoza's materialist metaphysics is the potent anomaly of the century: not a vanquished or marginal anomaly but, rather, an anomaly of victorious materialism, of the ontology of a being that always moves forward and that by constituting itself poses the ideal possibility for revolutionizing the world."</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Spinoza/Texts/toscano_spinoza_teheran.pdf |author=Toscano, Alberto |author-link=Alberto Toscano |title=The Politics of Spinozism: Composition and Communication (Paper presented at the Cultural Research Bureau of Iran, Tehran, January 4, 2005) |date=January 2005 |access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref><ref>Ruddick, Susan (2010), 'The Politics of Affect: Spinoza in the Work of Negri and Deleuze,'.

Born in [[Padua]], he became a political philosophy professor in his hometown university.

He is the father of [[film director]] [[Anna Negri]].

==Early years==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2011}}
Antonio Negri was born in [[Padua]], in the [[Northeast Italy|Northeastern Italian region]] of [[Veneto]], in 1933. His father was an active [[Communism|communist militant]] from the city of [[Bologna]] (in the [[Northeast Italy|Northeastern Italian region]] of [[Emilia-Romagna]]), and although he died when Negri was two years old, his political engagement made Negri familiar with [[Marxism]] from an early age, while his mother was a teacher from the town of [[Poggio Rusco]] (in [[province of Mantua]], [[Lombardy]]).<ref name=alqua2>{{cite web

}}</ref> He began his career as a militant in the 1950s with the activist Roman Catholic youth organization ''Gioventú Italiana di Azione Cattolica (GIAC).'' Negri became a [[communism|communist]] in 1953–54 when he worked at a [[kibbutz]] in Israel for a year. The kibbutz was organised according to ideas of [[zionism|Zionist]] socialism and all the members were Jewish communists.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ganahl|first=Rainer|url=http://semiotexte.com/?p=660|title=Marx is still Marx: Antonio Negri|work=Semiotext(e)|date=3 October 2010|access-date=2013-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030001958/http://semiotexte.com/?p=660|archive-date=30 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He joined the [[Italian Socialist Party]] in 1956 and remained a member until 1963, while at the same time becoming more and more engaged throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s in Marxist movements.

He had a quick academic career at the [[University of Padua]] and was promoted to full professor at a young age in the field of "''dottrina dello Stato''" (State theory), a peculiarly Italian field that deals with juridical and constitutional theory. This might have been facilitated by his connections to influential politicians such as [[Raniero Panzieri]] and philosopher [[Norberto Bobbio]], strongly engaged with the Socialist Party.

In the early 1960s, Negri joined the editorial group of ''Quaderni Rossi'', a journal that represented the intellectual rebirth of Marxism in Italy outside the realm of the communist party.

In 1969, together with [[Oreste Scalzone]] and [[Franco Piperno]], Negri was one of the founders of the group [[Potere Operaio]] (Workers' Power) and the ''[[Operaismo]]'' ([[workerist]]) Communist movement. ''Potere Operaio'' disbanded in 1973 and gave rise to the [[Autonomia]] Operaia Organizzata (Organised Workers' Autonomy) movement.

==Arrest and flight==
On 16 March 1978, [[Aldo Moro]], former Italian prime minister and Christian Democrat party leader, was kidnapped in Rome by the [[Red Brigades]], his five-man bodyguard murdered on the spot of the kidnapping in Rome's Via Fani. While they were holding him, forty-five days after the kidnapping,<ref name=windschuttle/> the Red Brigades called his family on the phone, informing Moro's wife of her husband's impending death.<ref name=windschuttle/> Nine days later his body, shot in the head, was found dumped in a city lane.<ref name=windschuttle/> The conversation was recorded, and later broadcast and televised. A number of people who knew Negri and remembered his voice identified him as the probable author of the call, but the claim has been since dismissed: the author of the call was, in fact, [[Valerio Morucci]].<ref name="telefonobluff">{{cite news|title=Tecniche d'indagine.

On 7 April 1979, Negri was arrested for his part in the Autonomy Movement, along with others (Emilio Vesce, Luciano Ferrari Bravo, Mario Dalmaviva, Lauso Zagato, [[Oreste Scalzone]], Pino Nicotri, Alisa del Re, Carmela di Rocco, Massimo Tramonte, Sandro Serafini, Guido Bianchini, and others). Padova's Public Prosecutor Pietro Calogero accused them of being involved in the political wing of the Red Brigades, and thus behind [[left-wing terrorism]] in Italy. Negri was charged with a number of offences, including leadership of the Red Brigades, masterminding the 1978 kidnapping and murder of the President of the Christian Democratic Party Aldo Moro, and plotting to overthrow the government.<ref name="bull">{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/malcolm-bull/you-cant-build-a-new-society-with-a-stanley-knife |title=You can't build a new society with a Stanley knife |author=Malcolm Bull |journal=London Review of Books |date=4 October 2001 |volume=23 |issue=19 |access-date=2010-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113214455/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/malcolm-bull/you-cant-build-a-new-society-with-a-stanley-knife |archive-date=13 January 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> At the time, Negri was a political science professor at the University of Padua and visiting lecturer at Paris' [[École Normale Supérieure]].

In France, Negri began teaching at the [[Paris 8 University|Paris VIII (Vincennes)]] and the [[Collège international de philosophie]], founded by [[Jacques Derrida]]. Although the conditions of his residence in France prevented him from engaging in political activities, he wrote prolifically and was active in a broad coalition of left-wing intellectuals. In 1990 Negri with Jean-Marie Vincent and Denis Berger founded the journal ''Futur Antérieur''. (The journal ceased publication in 1998 but was reborn as ''[[Multitudes]]'' in 2000, with Negri as a member of the international editorial board.)

In 1997, after a plea-bargain that reduced his prison time from 30 to 13 years,<ref name=windschuttle/> Negri returned to Italy to serve the end of his sentence. He was released from prison in the spring of 2003, having written some of his most influential works while behind bars.

== Political thought and writing ==
{{Left communism sidebar}}
Unlike other forms of [[Marxism]], autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the [[working class]] to force changes to the organization of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system independent of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[trade unions]] or [[political parties]]. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, for example [[absenteeism]], slow working, and socialization in the workplace. The journal ''Quaderni Rossi'' ("Red Notebooks"), produced between 1961 and 1965, and its successor ''Classe Operaia'' ("Working Class"), produced between 1963 and 1966, were also influential in the development of early autonomism. Both were founded by Antonio Negri and [[Mario Tronti]].

Today, Antonio Negri is best known as the co-author, with [[Michael Hardt]], of the controversial Marxist-inspired treatise ''[[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|Empire]]'' (2000).<ref name="bull"/>

In 2009 Negri completed the book ''Commonwealth'', the final in a trilogy that began in 2000 with ''Empire'' and continued with ''Multitude'' in 2004, co-authored with Michael Hardt.<ref name="gray">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/commonwealth-by-michael-hardt-amp--antonio-negribrfirst-as-tragedy-then-as-farce-by-slavoj-zizek-1823817.html |title=Commonwealth, By Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri / First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, By Slavoj Zizek |author=Gray, John |work=[[The Independent]] |date=20 November 2009 |access-date=2010-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144240/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/commonwealth-by-michael-hardt-amp--antonio-negribrfirst-as-tragedy-then-as-farce-by-slavoj-zizek-1823817.html |archive-date=14 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== ''Labor of Dionysus: A Critique of the State-Form'' (1994)===
In this book, the authors ask themselves "How is it, then, that labour, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society?" The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labour in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<ref>[http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/labor-of-dionysus Introductory page on the book by University of Minnesota press]</ref>

=== ''Insurgencies: Constituent Power and the Modern State'' (1999) ===
This book, written solely by Negri, "explores the drama of modern revolutions-from Machiavelli’s Florence and Harrington’s England to the American, French, and Russian revolutions-and puts forward a new notion of how power and action must be understood if we are to achieve a radically democratic future."<ref>[http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/insurgencies Introduction to the book by University of Minnesota Press]</ref>

=== ''Empire'' (2000) ===
{{main|Empire (Negri and Hardt book)}}
In general, the book theorizes an ongoing transition from a "modern" phenomenon of [[imperialism]], centered around individual [[nation-states]], to an emergent [[postmodern]] construct created among ruling powers which the authors call "Empire", with different forms of warfare:
<blockquote>...according to Hardt and Negri's ''Empire'', the rise of Empire is the end of national conflict, the "enemy" now, whoever he is, can no longer be ideological or national. The enemy now must be understood as a kind of criminal, as someone who represents a threat not to a political system or a nation but to the law. This is the enemy as a terrorist... In the "new order that envelops the entire space of... civilization", where conflict between nations has been made irrelevant, the "enemy" is simultaneously "banalized" (reduced to an object of routine police repression) and absolutized (like the Enemy, an absolute threat to the ethical order"<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, ''Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts & London, England: Harvard University Press, 2000), pg 6.</ref>).<ref>Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 171–172.</ref></blockquote>

''Empire'' elaborates a variety of ideas surrounding constitutions, global war, and class. Hence, the Empire is constituted by a [[monarchy]] (the [[United States]] and the [[G8]], and [[international organizations]] such as [[NATO]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] or the [[World Trade Organization]]), an [[oligarchy]] (the [[multinational corporations]] and other nation-states) and a democracy (the various [[non-government organization]]s and the [[United Nations]]). Part of the book's analysis deals with "imagin<nowiki>[ing]</nowiki> resistance", but "the point of Empire is that it, too, is "total" and that resistance to it can only take the form of negation - "the will to be against".<ref>Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pg 173.</ref> The Empire is total, but [[economic inequality]] persists, and as all identities are wiped out and replaced with a universal one, the identity of the poor persists.<ref>"The problem, as they see it, is that "postmodernist authors" have neglected the one identity that should matter most to those on the left, the one we have always with us: "The only non-localizable 'common name' of pure difference in all eras is that of the poor" (156)...only the poor, Hardt and Negri say, "live radically the actual and present being" (157)." Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 179–180.</ref>

=== ''Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire'' (2004)===
{{main|Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire}}
''Multitude'' addresses these issues and picks up the thread where ''Empire'' has left off. In order to do so, Hardt and Negri argue, one must first analyze the present configuration of war and its contradictions. This analysis is performed in the first chapter, after which chapters two and three focus on multitude and democracy, respectively. ''Multitude'' is not so much a sequel as it is a reiteration from a new point of view in a new, relatively accessible style that is distinct from the predominantly [[Academia|academic]] prose style of ''Empire''. Multitude remains, the authors insist, despite its ubiquitous subject matter and its almost casual tone, a book of philosophy which aims to shape a conceptual ground for a political process of democratization rather than present an answer to the question 'what to do?’ or offer a programme for concrete action.<ref>{{Citation | title= Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume= 22 | issue= 4 | pages= 69–79 | year= 2017 | url = https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}</ref>

=== ''Commonwealth'' (2009)===
{{main|Commonwealth (book)}}
[[File:Antonio Negri y Michael Hardt.jpg|thumbnail|right|Antonio Negri holding a copy of ''[[Commonwealth (book)|Commonwealth]]'', with co-author [[Michael Hardt]]]]
In this book, the authors introduce the concept of "the republic of property": "What is central for our purposes here is that the concept of property and the defence of property remain the foundation of every modern political constitution. This is the sense in which the republic, from the great bourgeois revolutions to today, is a republic of property".<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. ''Commonwealth''. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.15</ref> Part 2 of the book deals with the relationship between modernity and anti-modernity and proposes "[[altermodernity]]". Altermodernity "involves not only insertion in the long history of antimodern struggles but also rupture with any fixed dialectic between modern sovereignty and antimodern resistance. In the passage from antimodernity to altermodernity, just as tradition and identity are transformed, so too resistance takes on a new meaning, dedicated now to the constitution of alternatives. The freedom that forms the base of resistance, as we explained earlier, comes to the fore and constitutes an event to announce a new political project."<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. ''Commonwealth''. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.107</ref>

For [[Alex Callinicos]] in a review "What is newest in ''Commonwealth'' is its take on the fashionable idea of the common. Hardt and Negri mean by this not merely the natural resources that capital seeks to appropriate, but also "the languages we create, the social practices we establish, the modes of sociality that define our relationships", which are both the means and the result of biopolitical production. Communism, they argue, is defined by the common, just as capitalism is by the private and socialism (which they identify in effect with statism) with the public."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=11189 |title=Commonwealth. Book Review by Alex Callinicos, March 2010 |access-date=21 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703061220/http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=11189 |archive-date=3 July 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> For [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] Negri and Hardt "in the search of an altermodernity – something that is outside the dialectical opposition between modernity and anti-modernity – they need a means of escape. The choice between capitalism and socialism, they suggest, is all wrong. We need to identify something entirely different, communism – working within a different set of dimensions."<ref name="korotonomedya1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.korotonomedya.net/kor/index.php?id=27,316,0,0,1,0 |title=David Harvey, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt.

It 'should not shun identity politics but instead must work through it and learn from it,’ because it is the 'primary vehicle for struggle within and against the republic of property since identity itself is based on property and sovereignty.'”<ref name="korotonomedya1"/> In the same exchange in [[Artforum]] between Harvey and Micheal Hardt and Antonio Negri, Hardt and Negri attempt to correct Harvey in a concept that is important within the argument of ''Commonwealth''. As such, they state that "We instead define the concept of [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]], contrasting it to the figure of the individual on the one hand and forms of identity on the other, by focusing on three aspects of its relationship to multiplicity: Singularity refers externally to a multiplicity of others; is internally divided or multiple; and constitutes a multiplicity over time - that is, a process of becoming."<ref name="korotonomedya1"/>

=== Occupy movements of 2011–2012 and ''Declaration'' ===
In May 2012 Negri self-published (with Michael Hardt) an electronic pamphlet on the [[Occupy movement|occupy and encampment movements of 2011–2012]] called ''[[Declaration (book)|Declaration]]'' that argues the movement explores new forms of democracy. The introduction was published at ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' under the title "Take Up the Baton". He also published an article with Hardt in ''Foreign Affairs'' in October 2011 stating "The Encampment in Lower Manhattan Speaks to a Failure of Representation."<ref name="Foreign" />

=== ''Assembly and Essay Collections'' (2013-present) ===
In 2013, Negri published ''Spinoza: Politics and Postmodernity'', a collections of essays on Spinoza and his contemporary relevance to philosophy and political theory, translated into English by William McCuaig.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Negri|first1=Antonio|url=https://columbia.universitypressscholarship.com/10.7312/columbia/9780231160469.001.0001/upso-9780231160469|title=Spinoza for Our Time: Politics and Postmodernity|last2=Gangle|first2=Rocco|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-16046-9|translator-last=McCuaig|translator-first=William|doi=10.7312/columbia/9780231160469.001.0001}}</ref>

In 2017, Negri and Michael Hardt published ''Assembly''.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hardt|first1=Michael|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/assembly-9780190677961?cc=gb&lang=en&#|title=Assembly|last2=Negri|first2=Antonio|date=2017-10-26|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-067796-1|series=Heretical Thought|location=Oxford, New York}}</ref> The book provides a series of reflections on the nature of contemporary capitalism and social movements, drawing together the concepts and ideas explored previously in their ''Empire'' 'trilogy' such as the common, the multitude, and globalisation. It also introduces a new political concept of 'assembly', which draws on Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of an 'assemblage' (French: ''agencements'') as a way of thinking about mass movements and the role of constituent power. It also provides analyses of events that occurred in the years since ''Commonwealth'' was published in 2009, such as the rise of [[right-wing populism]], [[Occupy Wall Street]], the [[automation]] of work, and the [[digital economy]]. It continues their reflections on the character and goals of leaderless movements, and especially focuses on the ways in which these movements can seek to self-organise in [[Radical democracy|radically democratic]] and egalitarian ways. They propose that instead of the usual model of leadership and movement in which leadership serves to articulate the long-term and 'large scale' programme of the multitude, this relationship should instead be inverted: leadership instead comes to serve specific, tactical, and short-term ends (such as the organisation of specific moblisations, protests, direct action, strikes, etc.), while the multitude (or collective) serves to "articulate the long-term goals and objectives" to which the leadership must submit and facilitate.

The book received generally positive reviews. Writing for ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'', Kyle Perry argues that the central claim of the book is that "advocates for a truly democratic world must no longer refuse the demands of leading, strategizing, decision making, and institution building that can otherwise remain variously secondary, absent, or anathema amid left, liberatory, and progressive causes."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Services|first=University of Chicago IT|title=Critical Inquiry|url=https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/kyle_parry_reviews_assembly/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu|language=en}}</ref> It also rejects as a false binary the idea that liberal-democratic institutions should either be occupied or destroyed; instead, "The better move is to get creative about inventing new, effective, and crucially 'nonsovereign' institutions. Such institutions are not meant to 'rule over us' but to 'foster continuity and organization” and to “help organize our practices, manage our relationships, and together make decisions'." Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]],'' Terence Renaud argues that "Given how much the political terrain has changed since ''Empire'' appeared in 2000, much of Hardt and Negri’s project appears dead. It has said all that it’s going to say. Even so, the authors do an excellent job of highlighting the internal challenges that a resurgent left will face. Every new left risks degenerating into sectarian conflict, heavy-handed leadership, and complacency about its own righteousness. Hardt and Negri insist on a self-critical and internally democratic left that never ceases to call its own assumptions into question. In order to transform society, the left must first transform itself."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-08-16|title=Los Angeles Review of Books|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/assembling-a-new-left/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|language=en-US}}</ref>

Between 2016 and 2019, Negri published a three-volume collection of essays written in various years, but translated, collected and published together in English in these volumes. The first volume was titled ''Marx and Foucault'', and published on December 16, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-27|title=Marx and Foucault|url=https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=politybooks.com|language=en-US}}</ref> In this first volume, Negri aims to show "how the thinking of Marx and Foucault were brought together to create an original theoretical synthesis - particularly in the context of Italy from May ’68 onwards." The second volume was titled ''From the Factory to the Metropolis,'' and was published in February 2018. This second volume turns towards an analysis of the passage from the traditional proletarian 'mass worker' of industrial capitalism (especially as found in Marx's writing) to the contemporary 'socialised worker', as well as of the modern 'metropolis', which Negri describes as "a space of antagonisms between forms of life produced, on the one hand, by finance capital (the capital that operates around rents), and on the other by the 'cognitive proletariat'. The central question is then how 'the common' of the latter can be mobilised for the destruction of capitalism."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-27|title=From the Factory to the Metropolis|url=https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=politybooks.com|language=en-US}}</ref> The third and final volume of this 'trilogy' was titled ''Spinoza: Then and Now'', and was published in February 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-27|title=Spinoza|url=https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=politybooks.com|language=en-US}}</ref> In this third volume, Negri "examines how Spinoza’s thought constitutes a radical break with past ideas and an essential tool for envisaging a form of politics beyond capitalism."

On October 29, 2021, Negri will publish the first volume of a new trilogy of books. This first volume will be titled ''Marx in Movement: Operaismo in Context'', and will seek to provide an account and examination of the history of Italian Autonomist (or '[[Autonomism|Autonomist Marxist]]') thought, particularly in terms of Negri's theoretical development of the concept of the 'social worker' as an attempt to update Marxism in light of the changes since the factory-based industrial labour of Marx's time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-27|title=Marx in Movement|url=https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=politybooks.com|language=en-US}}</ref>
