Mr. Wallich's  proposal espoused in 1971 with [[Sidney Weintraub (economist born 1914 died 1983)|Sidney Weintraub]], a liberal economist, for a tax-based incomes policy, or TIP. The plan, to control inflation, required an income-tax surcharge to be levied on companies raising their average wage level above specified inflation-related guide-lines. The Wallich-Weintraub plan never became law. He was the board's main emissary to the Bank for International Settlements, the institution in Basel, Switzerland, that serves the world's central banks.<ref name="nyt-obit">Hershey, Robert D., Jr. (September&nbsp;16, 1988).

Wallich was known for his strong targeting of [[inflation]], once writing, "Like burglary, inflation is an extralegal form of redistribution, Unfortunately, many economists share with politicians the habit of always regarding inflation as the lesser of any alternative evils."<ref name="nyt-obit"/>
