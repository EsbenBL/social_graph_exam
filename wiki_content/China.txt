Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38% of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77% higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}</ref>

'''China''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|中国}}|p=Zhōngguó|l=Central State; Middle Kingdom|c=|t=<!--Do NOT add Traditional.

Please consult talk page before removing.-->|l=|c=|t=<!--Do NOT add Traditional. Simplified is the official script in China-->}}; [[abbreviation|abbr]]: '''PRC'''), is a country in [[East Asia]]. It is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by population|most populous country]], with a [[Population of China|population]] of more than 1.4 billion. China spans five geographical [[time zones]] and [[Borders of China|borders]] 14 different countries, the [[List of countries and territories by land borders|second most of any country]] in the world after [[Russia]]. Covering an area of approximately 9.6&nbsp;million square kilometres (3.7&nbsp;million mi<sup>2</sup>), it is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|third or fourth largest country]].{{efn|The total area ranking relative to the United States depends on the measurement of the total areas of both countries. See [[List of countries and dependencies by area]] for more information.

The following two primary sources (non-mirrored) represent the range (min./max.) of estimates of China's and the United States' total areas.

Both sources (1) ''exclude'' Taiwan from the area of China; (2) ''exclude'' China's coastal and territorial waters.

However, the CIA World Factbook ''includes'' the United States coastal and territorial waters, while Encyclopædia Britannica ''excludes'' the United States coastal and territorial waters.

Notably, the Encyclopædia Britannica specifies the United States' area (excluding coastal and territorial waters) as 9,525,067 km<sup>2</sup>, which is less than either source's figure given for China's area.<ref name="United States"/> Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters.
----

[[United Nations Statistics Division]]'s figure for the United States is {{cvt|9,833,517|km2}} and China is {{cvt|9,596,961|km2}}. These closely match the CIA World Factbook figures and similarly ''include'' coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but ''exclude'' coastal and territorial waters for China.

----

Further explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute about which is the world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations<ref name="31 Years of CIA World Factbook">{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfb/|title=31 Years of CIA World Factbook|publisher=CIA|access-date=31 January 2014}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> against the information for United States in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', particularly its footnote section.<ref name="United States">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States|title=United States|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref> In sum, according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of {{cvt|9,372,610|km2}}. However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to {{cvt|9629091|km2}}). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to {{cvt|9833517|km2}}). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. In other words, ''no'' coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of {{cvt|109362|km2}}, and a territorial water area of {{cvt|195213|km2}}, for a total of {{cvt|304575|km2}} of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand] and the United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the U.S. will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.}} The country is administratively divided into 23 [[Provinces of China|provinces]],{{efn|The disputed 23rd province of [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan]] is claimed by the People's Republic of China but it does not administer it. See {{section link||Administrative divisions}}}} five [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], four [[Direct-administered municipalities of China|direct-controlled municipalities]] ([[Beijing]] – [[capital city]], [[Chongqing]], [[Shanghai]] – [[List of largest cities|largest city]] and [[Tianjin]]), and two [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]] ([[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]). 

China emerged as one of the world's [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] in the fertile basin of the [[Yellow River]] in the [[North China Plain]]. China was one of the world's [[List of regions by past GDP (PPP)|foremost economic powers]] for most of the [[Pax Sinica|two millennia]] from the 1st until the 19th century. For millennia, China's political system was based on absolute hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-legendary [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE) saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907) and [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (960 – 1127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. The [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]], China's last dynasty, which formed the territorial basis for modern China, [[Century of humiliation|suffered]] heavy [[Unequal treaty|losses]] to foreign imperialism. The [[Monarchy of China|Chinese monarchy]] collapsed in 1912 with the [[1911 Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China was [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invaded]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]] [[Chinese Communist Revolution|resulted]] in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] (CCP)[[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on the [[mainland China|mainland]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led ROC government [[Retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan|retreated]] to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]].{{Efn|The KMT solely governed the island until its transition to democracy in 1996.|name=|group=}} Both claim to be [[Cross-Strait relations|the sole legitimate government of China]], although the [[United Nations]] has recognized the PRC as the sole representation since 1971. China is currently governed as a [[Unitary State|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Republic|socialist republic]] by the CCP.

China is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]], the [[Silk Road Fund]], the [[New Development Bank]], the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]], and the [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]], and is a member of the [[BRICS]], the [[G8+5]], the [[G20]], the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], and the [[East Asia Summit]]. It [[International rankings of China|ranks among the lowest]] in international measurements of [[civil liberties]], [[Corruption in China|government transparency]], [[Media freedom in China|freedom of the press]], [[Ethnic issues in China|freedom of religion and ethnic minorities]]. Chinese authorities have been criticized by [[List of Chinese dissidents|political dissidents]] and [[Human rights activist|human rights activists]] for widespread [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], including [[political repression]], [[Censorship in China|mass censorship]], [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]] of their citizens and violent suppression of protests. 

After [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], and [[China and the World Trade Organization|its entry]] into the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001, [[Economy of China|China's economy]] became the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest country by nominal GDP]] in 2010 and grew to the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest in the world by PPP]] in 2014.

China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert]]s in the arid north to the [[subtropical]] forests in the wetter south. The [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separate China from much of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]]. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the [[Pacific Ocean]] is {{cvt|14500|km}} long and is bounded by the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], [[East China Sea|East China]] and [[South China Sea|South China]] seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the [[Eurasian Steppe]] which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the [[Steppe Route|Steppe route]] – the ancestor of the terrestrial [[Silk Road UNESCO World Heritage Sites|Silk Road]](s).{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. The [[geographical center]] of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at {{coord|35|50|40.9|N|103|27|7.5|E|region:CN-62_type:landmark|name=Geographical center of China}}. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mount Everest]] (8,848&nbsp;m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|title=Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height|date=8 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154 m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/lowest-places-on-earth.htm|title=Lowest Places on Earth|date=28 February 2015|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=2 December 2013}}</ref>

From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]]. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move towards a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Agricultural collectivization]] was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs). Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership,<ref name="english.eastday">{{cite web|url=http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909205947/http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html|url-status=dead|archive-date= 9 September 2009|title=China is already a market economy—Long Yongtu, Secretary General of Boao Forum for Asia|publisher=EastDay.com|year=2008|access-date=14 July 2009}}</ref> and is one of the leading examples of [[state capitalism]].<ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ "Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives"].

Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a "1.5"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.<ref>{{cite news|title=China formalizes easing of one-child policy|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/12/28/china-one-child-policy/4230785/|newspaper=USA Today|date=28 December 2013}}</ref> In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a [[two-child policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/27/c_134955448.htm|title=Top legislature amends law to allow all couples to have two children|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=27 December 2015}}</ref> Data from the 2010 census implies that the [[total fertility rate]] may be around 1.4, although due to under-reporting of births it may be closer to 1.5–1.6.<ref>{{cite news|date=5 May 2011|title=The most surprising demographic crisis|work=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18651512|access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref>

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of [[feudalism]]".
