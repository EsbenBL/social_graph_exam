'''Dame Marilyn Joy Waring''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|DNZM}} (born 7 October 1952) is a New Zealand public policy scholar, [[international development]] consultant, former politician, environmentalist, feminist and a principal founder of [[feminist economics]].

In 1975, aged 23, she became New Zealand's youngest [[member of parliament]] for the liberal-conservative [[New Zealand National Party]]. As a member of parliament she chaired the [[Public Expenditure Committee]]. Her support of the opposition Labour Party's proposed [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987|nuclear-free New Zealand]] policy was instrumental in precipitating the [[1984 New Zealand general election]], and she left parliament in 1984.

On leaving parliament she moved into academia; she is best known for her 1988 book ''[[If Women Counted]]'', and she obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]] in political economy in 1989. Through her research and writing she is known as the principal founder of the discipline of [[feminist economics]]. Since 2006, Waring has been a Professor of Public Policy at the Institute of Public Policy at [[Auckland University of Technology|AUT]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, focusing on [[governance]] and [[public policy]], [[political economy]], [[gender analysis]], and [[human rights]]. She has taken part in international aid work and served as a consultant to [[UNDP]] and other international organisations.

She has outspokenly criticised the concept of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), the economic measure that became a foundation of the [[United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA)]] following [[World War II]]. She criticises a system which "counts oil spills and wars as contributors to economic growth, while child-rearing and housekeeping are deemed valueless".<ref name="EncyclopediaOfMotherhood">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Bjørnholt|first=Margunn|editor=[[Andrea O'Reilly]]|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Motherhood]]|title=Waring, Marilyn|year=2010|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=978-1-4129-6846-1|pages=1260–1261}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Concise Guide to Global Human Rights|last1=Fischlin|first1=Daniel|last2=Nandorfy|first2=Martha|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55164-294-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseguidetogl0000fisc}}</ref> Her work has influenced academics, government accounting in a number of countries, and United Nations policies.

==Early life==
Marilyn Waring grew up at Taupiri, where her parents owned a butchery. Her great-grandfather Harry (Arthur Henry) Waring had emigrated to New Zealand from Hopesay in [[Herefordshire]], England, in 1881, and established the family butchery business at Taupiri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.number8network.co.nz/2012/03/12/memories-of-the-meat-trade/|title=Memories of the meat trade|date=11 March 2012|website=Number 8 Network}}</ref> In 1927 Harry Waring stood unsuccessfully for election to parliament in the Raglan seat for the Reform Party, the forerunner of the National Party.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=1 Way 2 C the World: Writings 1984–2006|last=Waring|first=Marilyn|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2009|pages=10}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19420126.2.6|title=DEATHS (New Zealand Herald, 1942-01-26)|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz National Library of New Zealand|language=en|access-date=11 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19420126.2.110|title=OBITUARY (New Zealand Herald, 1942-01-26)|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz National Library of New Zealand|language=en|access-date=11 May 2017}}</ref> A talented soprano in her youth, her parents had hoped that she would become a classical singer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2018/may/1525096800/anne-manne/making-women-s-unpaid-work-count|title=Making women's unpaid work count|date=1 May 2018|website=The Monthly}}</ref> In 1973, Waring received an Honours BA in [[political science]] and [[international politics]] from [[Victoria University of Wellington]].

Waring joined the National Party while still a student at Victoria University. She joined the party because she supported the opposition National MP [[Venn Young]] who introduced a private member's bill into parliament for homosexual law reform; this was opposed by [[Norman Kirk]], the Labour Party Prime Minister.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2012/interview-marilyn-waring/|title=Interview: Marilyn Waring|last=Espiner|first=Guyon|date=3 December 2012|website=Noted|language=en|access-date=8 July 2019}}</ref>

In the 1975 general election, she became the [[New Zealand National Party]] member of Parliament for the [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan]] electorate.<ref>{{cite book |last1= McCallum |first1= Janet |title= Women in the House – Members of Parliament in New Zealand |year= 1993 |publisher= [[Cape Catley]] |location= Wellington |isbn= 0-908561-41-5 }}</ref> The Raglan electorate was north and south of Hamilton, included "the Labour voting towns of Huntly and Ngaruawahia (home of the Kingitanga movement) in the north, Raglan and the wild West Coast, and rich dairy farming country around [[Te Awamutu]] in the south". The electorate was abolished in 1978: her home town of Huntly and Ngaruawahia were now in the Rangiriri electorate and Raglan was in the Waikato electorate. Waring moved to the Waipa electorate, one of the safest National seats in the country and including the wealthy rural town of [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] and parts of the [[King Country]].{{sfn|Waring|2019|pp=22-23}}

Waring had taken up a part-time position in the (National) Opposition Research Unit in September 1974; working on "housing, fishing and women". In early 1975 both [[George Gair]] National’s housing spokesman and [[Keith Holyoake]] realised that it was "not a good situation" for there to be no women in the National Caucus. No woman candidate had been selected for a safe National seat; the last chance to select a woman was Raglan where Minister Doug Carter was retiring. So after reporting this to Gair, he suggested that she should stand. Within an hour senior statesman Holyoake was at her Research Unit desk, saying "George tells me you can stand? Do you come from there? Do you have a nomination form? (No). Here’s one – please fill it in. Do you have party members up there who would sign? (I have no idea. My Dad might know) What is your father’s telephone number." She left blank some sections on the form: war service, local government experience, awards and honours. Her work experience included butchery assistant, cleaner and barmaid plus student vacation worker for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a telephone technician, a musician and a "student" then parliamentary research officer. {{sfn|Waring|2019|pp=11-12}}

She made some house calls on party delegates for the selection meeting, starting in her home town of [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]]; borrowing her mother’s car (and some of her clothes).  She mentioned her opposition to sporting ties with South Africa. 26 of the 130 voting delegates were women; including [[Katherine O'Regan]] who became her electoral agent for eight years. The other candidates were men: a County Council chair, a Meat and Wool Section chair of  Federated Farmers, a National Party Divisional councillor and a popular local farmer who had stood as an independent in the 1972 election. The selection meeting was held at the Ngaruawahia High School assembly hall (she went there her first two years of secondary school). She was the last candidate to speak; each was given two sealed envelopes with the same subject to speak on. Party president [[George Chapman]]'s subject was agricultural incomes "not her strong suit" and Party leader [[Robert Muldoon]]'s was housing  policy;  a ''patsy'' question as he knew she was working on housing policy with Gair (as she pointed out to the meeting). {{sfn|Waring|2019|pp=11-19}}  

Her selection in 1975 reflected her "obvious ability and ... well-articulated convictions", but was helped because the two best-known local candidates disliked each other, and when one was eliminated his support went to Waring to prevent the selection of the other.<ref>{{cite book |last= [[Barry Gustafson|Gustafson]] |first= Barry |title= The First 50 Years: A History of the New Zealand National Party |year=  1986 |publisher= Reed Methuen |location= Auckland |isbn= 0-474-00177-6 |page= 286 }}</ref> One family block voted for her because another candidate had sold them a horse with a saddle sore concealed by a blanket. When her selection was announced Waring thought there had been "a dreadful mistake" but there was a round of stand-up cheering and [[Jim Bolger]] from the neighbouring King Country electorate raced up and embraced her on stage. She was later told by a scrutineer that she was ahead from the first ballot, and slowly climbed to over 50%.{{sfn|Waring|2019|pp=18,19}}

Muldoon said at the subsequent party caucus meeting in Wellington how pleased he was that she made it "We are going to win. I wanted a woman and I will help all I can". Holyoake agreed with Muldoon that "I haven’t seen anything like it in 40 years." {{sfn|Waring|2019|pp=11-19}} Aged 23, she was the youngest member of parliament at the time of her election.<ref name="Bloomberg1">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-18/women-unaccounted-for-in-global-economy-proves-waring-influence.html|title=Women Unaccounted for in Global Economy Proves Waring Influence|last1=Langeland|first1=Terje|date=18 June 2013|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HU4a0KMl?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-18/women-unaccounted-for-in-global-economy-proves-waring-influence.html|archive-date=19 June 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=18 June 2013}}</ref>

Together with [[Colleen Dewe]] (elected to the Lyttelton "swing" seat then held by Labour), at the time of their election, they were only the fourteenth and fifteenth women elected as a Member of Parliament in New Zealand. She was only one of two women in the government caucus and only one of four women elected in the 1975 election. After the 1978 election she was the sole female government MP, until [[Ruth Richardson]] was elected at the 1981 election.<ref>{{cite book|title=The First 50 Years : A History of the New Zealand National Party|last=Gustafson|first=Barry|publisher=Reed Methuen|year=1986|isbn=0-474-00177-6|location=Auckland|page=286|author-link=Barry Gustafson}}</ref> Both Waring and Richardson were members of the [[Women's Electoral Lobby (New Zealand)|Women's Electoral Lobby]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/women-together/womens-electoral-lobby-new-zealand|title=Women's Electoral Lobby of New Zealand 1975–2003|last=Julian|first=Rae|date=2018|website=New Zealand history online|access-date=30 January 2019}}</ref>

She fell out with Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]] almost immediately, and there were several episodes of conflict, although they also shared views on some issues such as welfare payments to single mothers, where Muldoon was a believer in the [[Welfare#New Zealand|welfare state]].

During her period in Parliament, she served as Chair of the [[Public Expenditure Committee]], Senior Government Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and on the Disarmament and Arms Control Committee. The appointment to the Public Expenditure Committee after the 1978 election was a considerable achievement for a member of only three years' standing. According to [[Barry Gustafson]],
:Waring recalled that she 'just fell off my chair' when Muldoon, without any prior consultation, announced at caucus that she would be chairperson of the very influential Public Expenditure Committee. This was a major position for an MP of only three years' experience and even more so in light of Waring's youth and controversial first term. Muldoon, however, knew that Waring had similar views and values on the economy to his own and that she had the intellectual capacity and drive to cope with complex investigation and analysis. He was also well aware that she would not be intimidated by ministers or senior officials.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Gustafson |first1= Barry |author-link1=Barry Gustafson |title= His Way: A Biography of Robert Muldoon |year= 2000 |publisher= [[Auckland University Press]] |location= Auckland |isbn= 978-1-86940-243-3 |page= 264 }}</ref>

She also served on the Select committee for Violent Offending, taking a particular interest in the Aroha Trust, formed by [[Black Power (New Zealand gang)|Black Power]] women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Desmond|first=Pip|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/trust-a-true-story-of-women-gangs/oclc/980285105|title=Trust: a true story of women & gangs|date=2012|publisher=Read How You Want|isbn=978-1-4596-3656-9|location=Auckland, NZ|page=241|language=en|oclc=980285105}}</ref> As a Member of Parliament, she was also the New Zealand Observer at the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]], and chaired the New Zealand Delegation to the [[OECD]] Conference on the Role of Women in the Economy in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.harvard.edu/marilyn-waring |title=Marilyn Waring &#124; The Institute of Politics at Harvard University |publisher=Iop.harvard.edu |access-date=29 August 2015}}</ref>

Waring had come especially to disagree with the National Party policy over the issue of a [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987|nuclear-free New Zealand]] and, on 14 June 1984, she informed the leadership that she would vote independently on nuclear issues, disarmament issues, and rape but would continue to support the Government on confidence. Since the National Party had only a one-seat majority, the government would be likely (though not certain) to lose on an issue Muldoon regarded as one of national security.

That evening Muldoon decided to call [[1984 New Zealand general election|a snap election to be held on 14 July]] (a general election was due at the end of the year). The election was a disaster for the National Party. Waring told Muldoon's biographer that she had deliberately sought to provoke Muldoon into this action.<ref>Waring interviewed by Gustafson, 24 February 1993, cited Gustafson, ''His Way'' p. 370 n. 33 and n. 38.</ref> [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987|The nuclear-free New Zealand legislation]] was subsequently enacted by the new Labour government. In her autobiography, ''The Political Years'', she described laughing as Muldoon berated her in a parliamentary office, and recounted eating an apple to taunt him as Muldoon drank and grew enraged.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12297326|title=New Year Honours: Dame Marilyn Waring's ground-breaking career honoured|first=Boris Jancic Political reporter, NZ Herald|last=boris.jancic@nzme.co.nz|date=30 December 2019|via=www.nzherald.co.nz|newspaper=NZ Herald}}</ref>{{sfn|Waring|2019|pp=341-344}} 

Jim Traue of the [[Alexander Turnbull Library]] asked if they could archive her papers; they did not normally archive MP’s papers (only Ministers) "but her collection would be different"; there were close to 400 cartons.{{sfn|Waring|2019|p=7}}

===Academic work===
In 1984 Waring left politics and returned to academia, where her research has focused on feminist economics, well-being, human rights and on economic factors that influence legislation and aid.

In 1988 she published ''[[If Women Counted]]'' (originally published with an introduction by [[Gloria Steinem]]). The book has also been published as ''Counting for Nothing'', but remains most widely known under the first title. It criticises the use of [[GDP]] as a surrogate for "progress," and argues that lacking valuation of women and nature drive decisions in [[globalisation]] that have unintended but terrible consequences for the world. According to [[Julie A. Nelson]], 
:"Marilyn Waring's work woke people up. She showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within national accounting systems, and the damage this causes. Her book [...] encouraged and influenced a wide range of work on ways, both numerical and otherwise, of valuing, preserving, and rewarding the work of care that sustains our lives. By pointing to a similar neglect of the natural environment, she also issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological sustainability that have only grown more pressing over time. In recent decades, the field of feminist economics has broadened and widened to encompass these topics and more."<ref>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Julie A.|author-link=Julie A.

A highly influential thinker and practitioner, her work has influenced both academia and [[United Nations]] policies.<ref name="wired1">{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/02/features/the-smart-list?page=all |title=The Smart List 2012: 50 people who will change the world |journal=Wired UK |publisher=Wired.co.uk |access-date=24 May 2012|date=24 January 2012 }}</ref> ''If Women Counted'' "persuaded the [[United Nations]] to redefine [[gross domestic product]], inspired new accounting methods in dozens of countries and became the founding document of the discipline of feminist economics."<ref name="Bloomberg1" /> Waring has continued to challenge governments to adopt her work even though some countries such as Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and South Korea have recognised unpaid work and improved data collection and statistics to inform policy making.<ref name="Bloomberg1" />

In 1989 Waring gained a D.Phil. in [[political economy]] from the [[University of Waikato]] with a thesis on the [[United Nations System of National Accounts]],<ref name="WaringJoinsAUT">{{cite web |url=http://oldwww.aut.ac.nz/staff/insideaut/2006_july/waring.htm |title= Marilyn Waring joins AUT |date= July 2006 |publisher= Inside AUT |access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{cite web |url=http://marilynwaring.com/html/bio.html |title= Marilyn Waring biography |publisher=marilynwaring.com |access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref> and in 1990 a University of Waikato [[Health Research Council of New Zealand|Research Council]] grant to continue work on "female human rights."

Between 1991 and 1994, Waring served as [[Senior Lecturer]] in Public Policy and the Politics of Human Rights with the Department of Politics at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.

In May 2006, Waring was appointed Professor of Public Policy at the Institute for Public Policy (IPP) at AUT. Her research focuses on [[governance]] and [[public policy]], [[political economy]], [[gender analysis]], and [[human rights]].

She was one of 16 prominent intellectuals invited to contribute to a French publication on human rights around the globe in 2007, along with [[Ken Loach]], [[Maude Barlow]], [[Walden Bello]] and [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldwww.aut.ac.nz/staff/insideaut/2007_march/rebel.htm |title= Rebel voice of the world |date= March 2007 |publisher=Inside AUT |access-date=10 May 2010}}</ref>

In 2014, the anthology ''Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics'', edited by [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] and [[Ailsa McKay]], was published. According to ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'', the book explores "a wide range of issues—including the fundamental meaning of economic growth and activity to consumption, health care, mortality, unpaid household work, mothering, education, nutrition, equality, and sustainability" and reveals "the breadth, depth, and substance that can grow from innovative ideas and critical analysis."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sullivan |first=T.E. |year= 2014 |title= Counting on Marilyn Waring: new advances in feminist economics |journal=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=52–1517 |doi= 10.5860/CHOICE.185300 }}</ref> [[Diane Elson]] argues that "despite many valiant efforts, women do not as yet really count in the conduct of economic policy. This book is an imaginative contribution to an ongoing struggle."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Elson |first=Diane |author-link= Diane Elson |year= 2015 |title= Book Review: Counting on Marilyn Waring: new advances in feminist economics |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/fr/journal/v109/n1/full/fr201458a.html |journal= Feminist Review |volume=109 |issue=109 |pages=e9–e11 |doi= 10.1057/fr.2014.58 |access-date=25 February 2015|doi-access=free }}</ref>

According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'',
:"Marilyn Waring is an extremely clear thinker about the disastrous consequences of using measures such as GDP as a surrogate for "progress" or "wellbeing" in a country. She has also analysed how economics as it is currently practised as a "science" is radically defective and that it drives decisions in globalisation that have unintended but terrible consequences for the world. We must realise that we can't tackle the problems in health care, environmental issues, food security, democracy and women's rights in isolation; they must be seen as a set of interrelated issues, and anyone who wants to make a difference in the human condition must look at all of these factors."<ref name="wired1"/>

===International aid work===
Waring has led the Gender and Governance team for the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]]. She also led [[UNDP]]'s largest project in the [[Asia Pacific]] for the Gender and Economic Policy Management Initiative. She led the Commonwealth Secretariat teams on Unpaid Work and HIV/Aids and on Social Protection. She has also served as a technical expert on gender and poverty for both UNDP and [[AUSAid]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/ny2020-dnzm|title=New Year Honours 2020 - Citations for Dames Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit|website=New Year Honours 2020 - Citations for Dames Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit}}</ref>

As for your future, that will be between you and your electorate" He refused to say anything to journalists; her electorate chairman and electorate Executive Committee told her she had their total support. An initial injunction against publishing the story arranged by [[Jim McLay]] had been overturned.{{sfn|Waring|2019|pp=61-170}}  

And Waring's strong pro-choice identification and vocal feminism overshadowed her lesbianism. Since she left Parliament in 1984, Waring has more openly acknowledged her sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.net.nz/history/Part4.html|title=Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender New Zealand History.

==Farming==
Since 1984 and in between her academic and activist engagements, Waring farmed [[angora goats]] and dry stock, latterly on her hill-farm north of Auckland.
