'''Lewis Alfred Coser''' (27 November 1913 in [[Berlin]] – 8 July 2003 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]) was a German-American [[sociologist]], serving as the 66th president of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1975.

==Biography==
Born in [[Berlin]] as Ludwig Cohen, his father was a successful Jewish industrialist. In 1933 he emigrated to Paris and in 1941 he left war-torn Paris for the [[United States]] where he married Rose Laub. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} In the Fifties, he enrolled as a graduate student in sociology at Columbia University, taking his PhD at the age of forty-one.<ref name="diss1" /> Coser first taught at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of California]]. He then founded the sociology department at [[Brandeis University]] and taught there for 15 years before joining the sociology department of the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]].<ref name="obit" /> Coser frequently worked with the eminent sociologist and his spouse, [[Rose Laub Coser]].

==Sociology==
Coser was the first sociologist to try to bring together [[structural functionalism]] and [[conflict theory]]; his work was focused on finding the functions of [[social conflict]]. Coser argued&nbsp;– with [[Georg Simmel]]&nbsp;– that conflict might serve to solidify a loosely structured group. In a [[society]] that seems to be disintegrating, conflict with another society, inter-group conflict, may restore the integrative core.  For example, the cohesiveness of [[Israeli Jews]] might be attributed to the long-standing conflict with the [[Arab]]s. Conflict with one group may also serve to produce cohesion by leading to a series of alliances with other groups.

Conflicts within a society, intra-group conflict, can bring some ordinarily isolated individuals into an active role. The protest over the [[Vietnam War]] motivated many young people to take vigorous roles in American political life for the first time.

Conflicts also serve a communication function. Prior to conflict, groups may be unsure of their adversary’s position, but as a result of conflict, positions and boundaries between groups often become clarified, leaving individuals better able to decide on a proper course of action in relation to their adversary.

Much like status consistency, conflicts along the same cleavages intensify the severity of the conflict. [[Cross-cutting cleavage]]s tend to dissipate the severity of the conflict. For example, the coincidence of economic and political disenfranchisement among [[Palestinians]] in the [[West Bank]] intensify their conflict with Israeli Jews. In contrast, the non-coincidence of economic and political disenfranchisement among [[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecer]]s reduces somewhat the severity of their conflict with [[English Canada]], especially with the rising prosperity of the [[French Canadian]] new middle class operating in the public sector and corporate world.

==Politics==
Coser was active within the [[anti-Stalinist left]], and was close to the independent leftists known as the [[New York intellectuals]]. A eulogy at [[Carlo Tresca]]'s memorial service in 1943 was delivered by [[Angelica Balabanoff]], the socialist activist and former Bolshevik. According to Coser's account of the funeral, "I was sitting near a burly Irish policeman who clearly didn't understand a word of Balabanoff's fierce Italian oratory. But at her climax he burst into tears."<ref name="diss2" />

In 1954, with [[Irving Howe]], Coser established the radical journal, ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]].'' Upon his death in 2003, the author of his obituary in that magazine suggested that Coser "always felt himself a marginal man. He was Jewish and non-Jewish; an American and a European; a hardheaded social analyst, committed to rigorous honesty in judgment and deed, and a passionate advocate; a leftist and a critic of the left; a defender of the underdog and something of an elite intellectual mandarin."

His ''The new conservatives: A critique from the left'' (with Irving Howe, 1974) was one of the first major works to define and analyse [[neoconservatism]].
