==Career==
He received his B.A. from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] and his Ph.D. at the [[University of Minnesota]]. As he worked towards his undergraduate degree at the University of Illinois he worked as a storm chaser in Illinois and the greater Midwest area.  

He has taught at the University of Minnesota, the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[Macalester College]], [[Wellesley College]], and the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Additionally, he was a visiting scholar at [[the New School for Social Research]] and the Dayan Center at [[Tel Aviv University]], and he was a visiting professor at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. Most recently, Barnett held the Harold Stassen Chair of International Affairs in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]] and Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota.

His most recent books are "[http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/international-relations-and-international-organisations/paternalism-beyond-borders?format=PB Paternalism beyond Borders]," Cambridge University Press, 2016; ''Empire of Humanity: A History of Humanitarianism'', [[Cornell University Press]], 2011; ''Humanitarianism Contested: Where Angels Fear to Tread'', with [[Thomas G. Weiss]], Routledge, 2011; and ''Sacred Aid: Faith and Humanitarianism'', with [[Janice Stein]] (eds.) Oxford University Press, 2012. With [[Emanuel Adler]], he reintroduced the concept of [[security community]] to international relations.

In ''Rules for the World'' (co-authored with [[Martha Finnemore]]), Barnett argue that international organizations derive power and autonomy from their [[rational-legal authority]] and control of information.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Blyth|first1=Mark|last2=Helgadottir|first2=Oddny|last3=Kring|first3=William|date=2016-03-17|editor1-last=Fioretos|editor1-first=Orfeo|editor2-last=Falleti|editor2-first=Tulia G|editor3-last=Sheingate|editor3-first=Adam|title=Ideas and Historical Institutionalism|url=https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199662814.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199662814-e-8|access-date=2021-02-28|website=The Oxford Handbook of Historical Institutionalism|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199662814.001.0001|isbn=9780199662814}}</ref> International organizations are therefore purposive social agents that can act inconsistently with the intentions of the founders of the organizations (which are often states). In contrast to some [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] and [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal]] theories of international relations, Barnett and Finnemore show that international organizations are not just a reflection of state interests and that they do not necessarily act efficiently. International organizations can develop bureaucratic cultures that result in adverse outcomes (what they call "pathologies"). They list five mechanisms that breed organizational pathologies:<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Michael|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7591/9780801465161|title=Rules for the World|last2=Finnemore|first2=Martha|date=2012|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-6516-1|doi=10.7591/9780801465161}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ege|first=Jörn|date=2020-11-23|title=What International Bureaucrats (Really) Want: Administrative Preferences in International Organization Research|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/gg/26/4/article-p577_5.xml|journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=577–600|doi=10.1163/19426720-02604003|issn=1942-6720|doi-access=free}}</ref>

# '''Irrationality of rationalization''': when an organization sticks to existing rules and procedures regardless of circumstances rather than act in ways most appropriate for the circumstances
# '''Universalism''': the application of universal rules and categories may not reflect specific contexts
# '''Normalization of deviance''': deviations from existing rules can become normalized and lead to aberrational behaviors
# '''Organizational insulation''': when organizations do not get feedback from the environment about their performance and are unable to update their behavior
# '''Cultural contestation''': different cultures within an organization may lead to clashes that produce adverse outcomes

He is known for his study "Power in International Politics" (co-authored with Raymond Duvall), which is among the most assigned work in international relations graduate training at American universities.<ref name=":2" /> The study presents four forms of power:<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Michael|last2=Duvall|first2=Raymond|date=2005|title=Power in International Politics|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877878|journal=International Organization|volume=59|issue=1|pages=39–75|doi=10.1017/S0020818305050010|jstor=3877878|issn=0020-8183}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Payne|first1=Rodger A.|last2=Samhat|first2=Nayef H.|date=2012-11-26|title=International Organizations and Power|url=https://oxfordre.com/internationalstudies/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-454|access-date=2021-05-01|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of International Studies|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.013.454|isbn=9780190846626}}</ref>

# '''Compulsory Power:''' direct control by one actor over another actor
# '''Institutional Power:''' control exercised by actors indirectly over other actors through diffuse relations of interaction
# '''Structural Power''': the constitution of subjects' capacities in direct structural relation to one another
# '''Productive Power''': the socially diffuse production of subjectivity (through discursive practices) in systems of meaning and signification

Barnett consistently ranks as one of the top-20 scholars "who has done the most interesting work in international relations in recent years" according to the yearly TRIP surveys.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |last1=Maliniak |first1=Daniel |last2=Oakes |first2=Amy |last3=Peterson |first3=Susan |last4=Tierney |first4=Michael J. |title=The View from the Ivory Tower: TRIP Survey of International Relations Faculty in the United States and Canada |url=https://www.wm.edu/offices/global-research/_documents/trip/ivory_tower_view_2007.pdf |website=www.wm.edu |access-date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130232415/https://www.wm.edu/offices/global-research/_documents/trip/ivory_tower_view_2007.pdf |archive-date=30 January 2020 |date=February 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=Department's International Relations Program Acclaimed {{!}} Department of Political Science {{!}} The George Washington University |url=https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/department’s-international-relations-program-acclaimed |website=politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu |access-date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606233229/https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/department%E2%80%99s-international-relations-program-acclaimed |archive-date=6 June 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
