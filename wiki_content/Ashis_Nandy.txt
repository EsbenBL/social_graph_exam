'''Ashis Nandy''' ({{lang-bn|আশিস নন্দী}}; born 13 May 1937) is an Indian [[Political psychology|political psychologist]], [[social theorist]], and critic. A trained [[clinical psychologist]], Nandy has provided theoretical critiques of [[European colonialism]], development, modernity, secularism, [[Hindutva]], science, technology, [[nuclearism]], cosmopolitanism, and utopia. He has also offered alternative conceptions relating to cosmopolitanism and critical traditionalism. In addition to the above, Nandy has offered an original historical profile of India's commercial cinema as well as critiques of state and violence.

He was Senior Fellow and Former Director of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS) for several years. Today,{{when|date=May 2021}} he is a Senior Honorary Fellow at the institute and apart from being the Chairperson of the Committee for Cultural Choices and Global Futures, also in New Delhi.<ref>[http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/NANDY.HTM Ashis Nandy] [[Emory University]].</ref><ref>[http://www.csds.in/faculty_ashis_nandy.htm Ashis Nandy – Senior Honorary Fellow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504181121/http://www.csds.in/faculty_ashis_nandy.htm |date=4 May 2009 }} [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS) website.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Nandy was born in a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Christians in India|Christian]] family<ref>{{cite web|title = 25, yet no Christian| url = http://www.heraldofindia.com/article.php?id=332| publisher = [[The Herald of India]]| accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = A short pause| url = http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/jan/12nandy.htm|date = 12 January 1999| publisher = [[Rediff]]| accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> at [[Bhagalpur]], Bihar, in 1937. He is the eldest of three sons of Satish Chandra Nandy and Prafulla Nalini Nandy, and brother of [[Pritish Nandy]]. Later, his family moved to [[Calcutta]]. Nandy's mother was a teacher at [[La Martiniere Calcutta|La Martiniere School]], [[Calcutta]] and subsequently became the school's first Indian vice principal. When he was 10, British India was partitioned into two sovereign countries – India and Pakistan. He witnessed the time of conflicts and atrocities that followed.

Nandy quit medical college after three years before joining [[Hislop College]], [[Nagpur]] to study social sciences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nakedpunch.com/articles/115|title=The Oppressed Have No Obligation to Follow the Rules of the Game|website=www.nakedpunch.com|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> Later he took a master's degree in sociology. However, his academic interest tended increasingly towards clinical psychology and he did his PhD in psychology at Dept. of Psychology, [[Gujarat University]], [[Ahmedabad]].

While a professed non-believer, Nandy identifies with the [[Bengali Christian]] community.<ref>"But as a Christian, do you identify with your community? Yes, I do, even though I am not a believer. I have been a nonbeliever from my teens, much to the sorrow of my parents, who were devout Christians. But I am a product of the Bengali Christian family and culture. I identify with it. I don’t disown it, particularly because it is such a small community. I do not belong to the majority community, which is 82% of the country’s population but some of them still feel and behave like a minority.

==Academic career==
Nandy joined the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS), Delhi, as a young faculty member. While working there, he developed his own methodology by integrating [[clinical psychology]] and sociology. Meanwhile, he was invited by a number of universities and research institutions abroad to carry out research and to give them lectures.  He served as the Director of CSDS between 1992 and 1997. He also serves on the Editorial Collective of [[Public Culture]], a reviewed journal published by Duke University Press.
[[File:Ashis Nandy bharat-s-tiwari-photography-IMG 1807 September 01, 2017.jpg|left|thumb|291x291px|Ashish Nandy in the library of the CSDS.]]
Nandy has coauthored a number of human rights reports and is active in movements for peace, alternative sciences and technologies, and cultural survival. He is a member of the Executive Councils of the [[World Futures Studies Federation]], the [[Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative]], the International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development, and the [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]]. Nandy has been a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at the [[Wilson Center]], Washington, D.C., a Charles Wallace Fellow at the [[University of Hull]], and a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities, [[University of Edinburgh]]. He held the first UNESCO Chair at the Center for European Studies, [[University of Trier]], in 1994. In 2006 he became the National Fellow of the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]].

Professor Nandy is an intellectual who identifies and explores numerous and diverse problems. He has written extensively in last two decades. His 1983 book, titled ''The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism'', talked about the psychological problems posed at a personal level by colonialism, for both coloniser and colonised. Nandy argues that the understanding of self is intertwined with those of race, class, and religion under colonialism, and that the Gandhian movement can be understood in part as an attempt to transcend a strong tendency of educated Indians to articulate political striving for independence in European terms. Through his prolific writing and other activities supported by his belief in non-violence, Professor Nandy has offered penetrating analysis from different angles of a wide range of problems such as political disputes and racial conflicts, and has made suggestions about how human beings can exist together, and together globally, irrespective of national boundaries.

==Controversies==
During the [[Jaipur Literature Festival]] held in January 2013, Nandy participated in a panel where he was quoted to have made controversial statements on corruption among "lower" [[caste]]s in India. It was reported that he said,

{{quote|text=It is a fact that most of the corrupt come from OBCs and Scheduled Castes and now increasingly the Scheduled Tribes. I will give an example. One of the states with the least amount of corruption is state of West Bengal when the CPI(M) was there. And I must draw attention to the fact that in the last 100&nbsp;years, nobody from OBC, SC and ST has come anywhere near to power. It is an absolutely clean state.<ref>
{{cite web|title=Most of the Corrupt From SC/STs, OBCs: Ashis Nandy|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/most-of-the-corrupt-from-scsts-obcs-ashis-nandy/788010|work=Outlook India|publisher=Outlook Publishing India Pvt. Ltd.|accessdate=16 December 2016}}
</ref>}}

[[Rajasthan Police]] lodged an [[First Information Report|FIR]] under the SC/ST Act against Ashis Nandy for his statement regarding corruption among the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|SC/ST]] and [[Other Backward Class|OBC]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/and-more/rajasthan-police-file-fir-summon-ashis-nandy_127053.htm|title=Rajasthan Police file FIR, summon Ashis Nandy|date=29 January 2013|publisher=}}</ref> After Nandy's lawyer moved the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] to quash all the allegations against him, the Court issued a stay order on his arrest on 1 February 2013.<ref name=DNA>{{cite news|last=ANI|title=JLF controversy: Supreme Court steps in to prevent Ashis Nandy's arrest|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_jlf-controversy-supreme-court-steps-in-to-prevent-ashis-nandy-s-arrest_1794923|accessdate=1 February 2013|newspaper=Daily News & Analysis|date=1 February 2013}}</ref> The subaltern scholar Dr. Satyanarayana has challenged Nandy's remarks and expressed shock at the vociferous support he received for this from the Indian media and academia, asking rhetorically, "Is Prof.&nbsp;Nandy a holy cow?".<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Prof. Ashis Nandy a holy cow?|url=http://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6195:qis-ashis-nandy-a-sacred-cowq&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132|work=Roundtableindia.co.in|publisher=roundtableindia|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>{{POV check inline|reason=Supporting views not mentioned|date=November 2016}}

Scholars say Nandy was at his [[Satire|satirical]] best when he made the comment but the [[sarcasm]] was lost on his detractors. They took this as an opportunity to attack him. But Nandy's sarcasm is well known in academic circles who were not surprised by the comment. In fact, he found support from academic quarters. Interestingly, three years later, in 2016-17, he received the KK Daomdaran Award from the Sree Narayana Mandira Samiti, Mumbai for his lifetime achievement as a scholar and intellectual, and for his contribution to the cause of the marginalised communities and castes.

== Views on Narendra Modi ==
In 2019, [[The New Yorker]] magazine reported:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/09/blood-and-soil-in-narendra-modis-india|title=Blood and Soil in Narendra Modi’s India|last=Filkins|first=Dexter|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> “During the dispute over [[Babri Masjid]], Ashis Nandy began a series of interviews with [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|R.S.S.]] members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]]. One of those he met was [[Narendra Modi]], who was then a little-known [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told [the reporter], exhibited all the traits of an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a [[Global Conspiracy|global conspiracy]], in which every [[Muslims|Muslim]] in the country was likely complicit. ‘Modi was a [[Fascism|fascist]] in every sense,’ Nandy said. ‘I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.’”
