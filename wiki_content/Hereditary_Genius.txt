==Contemporary reception==
[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] wrote a favourable review of ''Hereditary Genius'' in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', concluding that the book "...will take rank as an important and valuable addition to the science of [[human nature]]."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wallace |first=Alfred R. |author-link=Alfred Russel Wallace |date=March 1870 |title=Hereditary Genius, an Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |language=en |volume=1 |issue=20 |pages=501–503 |doi=10.1038/001501a0 |issn=0028-0836|bibcode=1870Natur...1..501W |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1587117 }}</ref> In general, contemporary scientists in [[Victorian England]] reviewed the book favourably, but reception among non-scientific Victorian readers was more mixed: religious commentators were much more critical of the book than were those of neither a scientific nor a religious background.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gökyigit |first=Emel Aileen |date=1994 |title=The reception of Francis Gallon's Hereditary genius in the Victorian Periodical Press |journal=[[Journal of the History of Biology]] |language=en |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=215–240 |doi=10.1007/BF01062563 |pmid=11639319 |issn=0022-5010}}</ref> Writing in ''[[the Journal of Anthropology]]'', George Harris wrote, "We thank Mr. Galton for leading the way. We have canvassed his opinions freely; and, frequently as we differ from him, we must again assert our belief as to the value of his efforts, and the candid manner in which he has conducted his inquiries".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Harris |first=George |last2=Galton |first2=Francis |date=July 1870 |title=Hereditary Genius |journal=[[The Journal of Anthropology]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=56 |doi=10.2307/3024796|jstor=3024796 }}</ref> [[Charles Darwin]], a cousin of Galton, praised the book, writing in a letter to his cousin, {{blockquote|I have only read 50 pages of your book (to Judges), but I must exhale myself, else something will go wrong with my inside. I do not think I ever in all of my life read anything more interesting and original—and how well and clearly you put every point!"<ref name="significance"/>}}

==Influence==
''Hereditary Genius'' continued to influence the [[white supremacist]] movement in the United States in the early 21st century.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Berlet|first1=Chip|authorlink1=Chip Berlet|first2=Stanislav|last2=Vysotsky|title=Overview of U.S. White Supremacist Groups|journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology|volume=34|issue=1|year=2006|page=14|url=https://www.academia.edu/2484782/Overview_of_U_S_White_Supremacist_Groups}}</ref>
