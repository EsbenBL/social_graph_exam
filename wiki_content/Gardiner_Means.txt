'''Gardiner Coit Means''' (June 8, 1896 in [[Windham, Connecticut]]<ref>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Gardiner+Means The Free Dictionary]</ref> â€“ February 15, 1988 in [[Vienna, Virginia]])<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/18/obituaries/gardiner-c-means-91-is-dead-pricing-theory-aided-us-policy.html New York Times obituary]</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] who worked at [[Harvard University]], where he met lawyer-diplomat [[Adolf A. Berle]]. Together they wrote the seminal work of [[corporate governance]], ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]''.  During the [[New Deal]], Means served as an economic adviser to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]].

==Academic work==
Means followed the [[Institutional economics|institutionalist]] tradition of economists. In 1934 he coined term "administered prices" to refer to prices set by firms in [[monopoly]] positions. In ''The Corporate Revolution in America'' (1962) he wrote:

<blockquote>"We now have single corporate enterprises employing hundreds of thousands of workers, having hundreds of thousands of stockholders, using billions of dollars' worth of the instruments of production, serving millions of customers, and controlled by a single management group. These are great collectives of enterprise, and a system composed of them might well be called "collective capitalism."</blockquote>

Means argued that where an economy is fueled by big firms it is the interests of [[management]], not the [[public]], that govern [[society]].
