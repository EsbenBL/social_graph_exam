The '''American Political Science Association''' ('''APSA''') is a [[professional association]] of [[political science]] students and scholars in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1903, in the Tilton Memorial Library (now Tilton Hall) of [[Tulane University]] in New Orleans,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/news-events/publications/newsletter-archive/apsa-nov-2016#:~:text=Founded%20on%20December%2030%2C%201903,study%20of%20history%20and%20economics.|title=The American Political Science Association Founded at Tulane|access-date=November 19, 2020}}</ref> it publishes four [[academic journal]]s (''[[American Political Science Review]]'', ''[[Perspectives on Politics]]'', ''Journal of Political Science Education,'' ''[[PS Political Science & Politics|PS: Political Science & Politics]]''). APSA Organized Sections publish or are associated with 15 additional journals.

APSA presidents serve one-year terms. The current president is [[Paula D. McClain]] of Duke University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apsanet.org/ABOUT/Leadership-Governance/APSA-Presidents-1903-to-Present|title=American Political Science Association > ABOUT > Governance > APSA Presidents and Presidential Addresses: 1903 to Present|website=www.apsanet.org|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> [[Woodrow Wilson]], who later became [[President of the United States]], was APSA president in 1909. APSA has its headquarters at 1527 [[New Hampshire Avenue]] NW in [[Washington, D.C.]], in a historic building that was owned by Admiral George Remy, labor leader [[Samuel Gompers]], the [[American War Mothers]], and [[Harry Garfield]], son of President [[James A. Garfield]] and president of the association from 1921 to 1922.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsonet.org/about-us/offices-tour|title=Office Tour {{!}} Policy Studies Organization|website=www.ipsonet.org|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>

APSA administers the Centennial Center for Political Science and Public Affairs, which offers fellowships, conference, research space, and grants for scholars, and administers [[Pi Sigma Alpha]], the [[honor society]] for political science students. APSA also periodically sponsors [[seminar]]s and other events for political scientists, [[policymaker]]s, the media, and the general public.

== Conferences and meetings ==
The association broadly aims to encourage scholarly understanding of political ideas, norms, behaviors, and institutions, and to inform public choices about government, governance, and public policy. APSA's mission is to "support excellence in scholarship and teaching and informed discourse about politics, policy and civic participation."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/Portals/54/goverance/2017-19_Strategic_Plan.pdf?ver=2017-11-02-160130-890|title=APSA Strategic Plan|access-date=May 23, 2020}}</ref> APSA conducts several annual conferences, which provide an environment for scholars and other professionals to network and present their work, along with other pertinent and useful resources. The APSA Annual Meeting is among the world's largest gatherings of political scientists. It occurs on [[Labor Day]] weekend each summer. The 2019 Annual Meeting is scheduled for August 29 – September 1 in Washington, DC.

The  APSA Teaching and Learning Conference is a smaller working group conference hosting cutting-edge approaches, techniques, and methodologies for the political science classroom. The conference provides a forum for scholars to share effective and innovative teaching and learning models and to discuss broad themes and values of political science education—especially the scholarship of teaching and learning.

With funding from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], APSA has organized political science workshops in various locations in Africa, APSA Africa Workshops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.apsanet.org/africa/|title=Africa Workshops &#124;|website=web.apsanet.org|date=2 November 2016|access-date=May 23, 2020}}</ref> The first workshop was convened in Dakar, Senegal in partnership with the West African Research Center from July 6–27, 2008. The annual residential workshops are led by a joint U.S. and African organizing team and aimed at mid-and junior-level scholars residing in Africa. They will enhance the capacities of political scientists and their resources in East and West Africa while also providing a forum for supporting their ongoing research. Each three week workshop brings together up to 30 scholars and cover substantive issues, methodologies, and reviews of research. See also, APSA International Programs.

== Awards ==
To recognize excellence in the profession, the Association offers the following awards:
* Dissertation Awards
* Paper and Article Awards
* Book Awards
* Career Awards
* Goodnow Award
* Teaching Award and Campus Teaching Award Recognition

In addition to the APSA awards, the APSA organized sections also present over 100 awards at every Annual Meeting to recognize important research and contributions to the profession. These awards are presented at the Association's Annual Meeting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apsanet.org/awards|title=American Political Science Association > PROGRAMS > APSA Awards|website=www.apsanet.org|access-date=May 23, 2020}}</ref>

== Centennial Center for Political Science and Public Affairs ==
Through its facilities and endowed funding programs, APSA'S Centennial Center for Political Science and Public Affairs supports political science teaching, research, and public engagement. Opened in 2003, the centenary of APSA's establishment, the Centennial Center encourages individual research and writing in all fields of political science, facilitates collaboration among scholars working within the discipline and across the social and behavioral sciences and humanities, and promotes communication between scholars and the public.

The Centennial Center, its facilities, and research support programs continue to be made possible in part through the generous donations of APSA members. The Centennial Center for Political Science and Public Affairs assists APSA members with the costs of research, including travel, interviews, access to archives, or costs for a research assistant. Funds can also be used to assist scholars in publishing their research. Grants can range in size from $500 to $10,000, depending upon the research fund.

== Congressional Fellowship Program ==
The APSA Congressional Fellowship Program is a highly selective, nonpartisan program devoted to expanding knowledge and awareness of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Since 1953, it has brought select [[political scientists]], journalists, federal employees, health specialists, and other professionals to [[Capitol Hill]] to experience Congress at work through fellowship placements on congressional staffs.

The nine-month program begins each November with an intensive one-month introduction to Congress taught by leading experts in the field. After orientation, fellows work in placements of their choosing and also participate in ongoing seminars and enrichment programs.

Through this unique opportunity, the American Political Science Association enhances public understanding of policymaking and improves the quality of scholarship, teaching and reporting on American national politics.<ref>See more on the [http://www.apsanet.org/cfp Congressional Fellowship Program.]</ref>

== Publications ==
One key component of APSA's mission is to support political science education and the professional development of its practitioners. The APSA publications program attempts to fill the diverse needs of political scientists in academic settings as well as practitioners working outside of academia, and students at various stages of their education.
