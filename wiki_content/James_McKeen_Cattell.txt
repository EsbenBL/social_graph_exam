'''James McKeen Cattell''' (May 25, 1860 – January 20, 1944), [[United States|American]] [[psychology|psychologist]], was the first professor of psychology in the United States, teaching at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and long-time editor and publisher of scientific journals and publications, most notably the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as [[Society for Science & the Public]] (or SSP), from 1921–1944.

At the beginning of Cattell's career, many scientists regarded psychology as, at best, a minor field of study, or at worst a [[pseudoscience]] such as [[phrenology]]. Perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, Cattell helped establish psychology as a legitimate science, worthy of study at the highest levels of the academy.  At the time of his death, ''The New York Times'' hailed him as "the dean of American science."  Yet Cattell may be best remembered for his uncompromising opposition to American involvement in [[World War I]].<ref name="baron2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/history/cattelltext.htm|title=History: Cattell at Penn|author=Jonathan Baron|year=2006|access-date=2014-09-24}} Baron cites C. S. Gruber (1972), "Academic freedom at Columbia University: The case of James McKeen Cattell", ''AAUP Bulletin'', Autumn, pp. 297-305, with respect to Cattell's views on the war and place in the debate on academic freedom.</ref>  His public opposition to the draft led to his dismissal from his position at [[Columbia University]], a move that later led many American universities to establish [[tenure]] as a means of protecting unpopular beliefs.<ref name="baron2006"/>

==Early life==
Born in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] in 1860, Cattell grew up the eldest child of a wealthy and prominent family.  His father, [[William Cassady Cattell]], a [[Presbyterian]] minister, became president of [[Lafayette College]] in Easton shortly after James' birth.  William Cattell could easily provide for his children, because he had married Elizabeth "Lizzie" McKeen in 1859; together they shared Lizzie's substantial inheritance. To this picture of the family's success one could add political power as well: James's uncle [[Alexander Gilmore Cattell]] represented [[New Jersey]] in the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://memberscongress.lawi.us/alexander-gilmore-cattell/|title=Cattell, Alexander Gilmore|first=Edward|last=Smyth|date=March 18, 2015}}</ref>

Cattell entered [[Lafayette College]] in 1876 at the age of sixteen, and graduated in four years with the highest honors.  In 1883 the faculty at Lafayette awarded him an M.A., again with highest honors.  Despite his later renown as a scientist, he spent most of his time devouring [[English literature]], although he showed a remarkable gift for [[mathematics]] as well. Cattell said [[Francis Andrew March]], a [[philologist]], was a great influence during his time at Lafayette.<ref name=dab>{{Cite DAB|title=Cattell, James McKeen|year=1973|volume=Supplement Three (1941-1945)|author=Dorothy Ross}}</ref>

Cattell did not find his calling until after he arrived in [[Germany]] for graduate studies, where he met [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at the [[University of Leipzig]].  He also studied under [[Hermann Lotze]] at the [[University of Göttingen]], and an essay on Lotze won him a fellowship at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he left Germany to study in October 1882.<ref name=dab/> The fellowship was not renewed,<ref name=dab/> and he returned to [[Leipzig]] the next year as Wundt's assistant.

The partnership between Wundt and Cattell proved highly productive, as the two helped to establish the formal study of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].  Under Wundt, Cattell became the first American to publish a dissertation in the field of psychology. The title of his German dissertation was ''Psychometrische Untersuchungen'' (''Psychometric Investigation''). The dissertation was accepted by the University of Leipzig in 1886.  More controversially, Cattell tried to explore the interiors of his own mind through the consumption of the then-legal drug [[hashish]].  Under the influence of this drug, Cattell once compared the whistling of a schoolboy to a [[symphony orchestra]].  While [[recreational drug use]] was not uncommon among early psychologists, including [[Freud]], Cattell's experimentation with hashish reflected a willingness to go against conventional opinion and morality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The main street in the College Hill Neighborhood of Easton, Pennsylvania, home to Lafayette College, is named after Cattell.

==Academic career==
After completing his Ph.D. with Wundt in Germany in 1886, Cattell took up a lecturing post at the [[University of Cambridge]] in England, and became a Fellow of [[St John's College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=CTL886JM|name=Cattell, James McKeen}}</ref> He made occasional visits to America where he gave lectures at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 1889 he returned to the United States to take up the post of Professor of Psychology in Pennsylvania, and in 1891 moved to [[Columbia University]] where he became Department Head of Psychology, [[Anthropology]], and [[Philosophy]]; He became President of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1895. He was elected as a member to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1888.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=1888&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-07-07|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

From the beginning of his career, Cattell worked hard to establish psychology as a field as worthy of study as any of the "hard" physical sciences, such as chemistry or physics.  Indeed, he believed that further investigation would reveal that the intellect itself could be parsed into standard units of measurements. He also brought the methods of Wilhelm Wundt and [[Francis Galton]] back to the United States, establishing the mental testing efforts in the U.S.

In 1917, Cattell and English professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Dana (grandson of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[Richard Henry Dana Jr.]]) were fired from Columbia University for opposing the United States’ conscription policy during World War I.<ref>''[[Current Literature|Current Opinion]]'', November 1917, p.294</ref> Years later he sued the university and won an annuity. In 1921, he used the money that he had gained from the settlement in order to start [[Harcourt Assessment|The Psychological Corporation]] to foster his interest in the field of applied psychology. Because he was never able to really explain how psychologists can apply their work, the organization failed until taken over by other psychologists who had experience in applied psychology. Towards the end of his life, Cattell still edited and published his journals. To help himself in the process, he created the Science Press Printing Company in order to produce his journals. He continued his work on the journals until his death in 1944 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

==Eugenicist beliefs==

Like many eminent scientists and scholars of the time, Cattell's thought was influenced by belief in [[eugenics]], defined as the "applied science or the bio-social movement which advocates the use of practices aimed at improving the genetic composition of a population, usually referring to human populations."<ref>"Eugenics", Unified Medical Language System (Psychological Index Terms), National Library of Medicine, 26 Sep. 2010.</ref> Cattell's belief in eugenics was heavily influenced by the research of [[Charles Darwin]], whose [[theory of evolution]] motivated Cattell's emphasis on studying “the psychology of [[individual differences]]”.<ref name="Benjamin">{{cite book |last=Benjamin |first=L.T., Jr. |author-link=Ludy T. Benjamin |year=1993 |title=A history of psychology in letters |location=Dubuque, IA |publisher=Wm. C. Brown |oclc=26931839 |isbn=978-0697129802 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofpsychol0000benj }}</ref>

In connection with his eugenicist beliefs, Cattell's own research found that men of science were likely to have fathers who were clergymen or professors. Incidentally, Cattell's father was both.<ref name="Sokal">{{cite journal | last1 = Sokal | first1 = M. M. | year = 1980 | title = Science and James McKeen Cattell, 1894 to 1945 | journal = Science | volume = 209 | issue = 4452| pages = 43–52 | doi=10.1126/science.7025202 | pmid=7025202| bibcode = 1980Sci...209...43S }}</ref>

Cattell believed that he had “inherited ability", but he also credited the influence of his environment, saying "it was my fortune to find a birthplace in the sun. A [[germplasm]] fairly well compounded [good genes] met circumstances to which it was unusually fit to react”.<ref name="Sokal"/> Cattell's belief in eugenics even motivated him to offer his own children monetary gifts of $1,000 if they married the offspring of a university professor or academic professional.<ref name="Thorne">Thorne, B. M., Henley, T. (2001). ''Connections in the history and systems of psychology''.  Boston: Houghton Mifflin</ref>

==Mental tests==
Cattell's research on individual differences played a significant role in introducing and emphasizing the experimental technique and importance of methodology in experimentation in America.<ref name="Pillsbury">Pillsbury, W.B. (1947). ''Biographical Memoir of James McKeen Cattell 1860-1944. National Academy of the Sciences''. http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/cattell-james-m.pdf</ref> Regarding the beginnings of his mental tests, in Leipzig, Cattell independently began to measure “simple [[mental processes]]”<ref name="Thorne"/> Between 1883 and 1886, Cattell published nine articles discussing human [[reaction time]] rates and [[individual differences]].<ref name="Thorne"/> As professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Cattell administered a battery of ten tests to student volunteers, and for the first time introduced the term “mental tests” as a general term for his set of tests which included measures of sensation, using weights to determine just-noticeable differences, reaction time, [[human memory]] span, and rate of movement.<ref name="Thorne"/> When Cattell moved to Columbia University, the battery of tests became compulsory for all freshmen. Cattell believed that his mental tests were measuring intelligence; however, in 1901 [[Clark Wissler]], a student of Cattell, demonstrated that there was no [[Correlation|statistical relationship]] between scores on Cattell's tests and academic performance. The tests were finally rendered irrelevant with the development of [[Alfred Binet]]’s [[intelligence measurement]]s.<ref name="Thorne"/><ref name="Applied History">Applied History of Psychology/Models of Testing. Wikibooks. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Applied_History_of_Psychology/Models_of_Assessment</ref>

==Journals==

Cattell was well known for his involvement in creating and editing scientific journals. He was so involved in owning and publishing journals, that his research productivity declined. He founded the journal ''[[Psychological Review]]'' in 1894 along with [[James Mark Baldwin]].  He also acquired the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and, within five years, made it the official publication of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], 1895-1900.  In 1900, he purchased ''Popular Science Monthly'' from [[D. Appleton & Company]].  In 1915, the title was purchased from him and became ''[[Popular Science]]''. He, in turn, founded and edited ''[[The Scientific Monthly]]'', which went to the subscribers of the old ''Popular Science Monthly'' as a substitute.<ref name="Pillsbury"/><ref name = "PSM Sep 1915">{{cite journal | last = Cattell | first = James McKeen | title = The Scientific Monthly and the Popular Science Monthly | journal = Popular Science Monthly | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–310 |date = September 1915| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QqUVAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA307}}</ref>

Cattell was the editor of ''Science'' for nearly 50 years. During that time, he did much to promote psychology as a science by seeing to it that empirical studies in psychology were prominently featured in the journal.<ref name="Thorne"/> Regarding his impact on the development of psychology as a science, [[Ludy T. Benjamin]] wrote of Cattell's editorship “there is no denying that it significantly enhanced psychology’s visibility and status among the older sciences.”<ref name="Benjamin"/>{{rp|56}}

==Skepticism==

Cattell was skeptical of [[paranormal]] claims and [[spiritualism]]. He had dismissed the medium [[Leonora Piper]] as a fraud. He was involved in a debate over Piper with the psychologist [[William James]] in the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' journal.<ref>Cattell, J. M. (1898). ''Mrs. Piper, the medium''. ''Science'' 7: 534-535.</ref><ref>James, W. (1898). ''Mrs. Piper, "the medium".'' ''Science'' 7: 640-641.</ref><ref>Cattell, J. M. (1898). ''Mrs. Piper, "the medium"''. ''Science'' 7: 641-642.</ref> He took issue with James's support for [[Parapsychology|psychical research]].<ref>Kimble, Gregory A; Wertheimer, Michael; White, Charlotte. (2013). ''Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology''. Psychology Press. p. 23. {{ISBN|0-8058-0620-2}}</ref> In a letter to James he wrote that the "[[Society for Psychical Research]] is doing much to injure psychology".<ref>Goodwin, C. James. (2015). ''A History of Modern Psychology''. Wiley. p. 154. {{ISBN|978-1-118-83375-9}}</ref>

==Family==
He married Josephine Owen, the daughter of an English merchant, in 1888. Their seven children got their pre-college educations at home with their parents as instructors.  The whole family shared in Cattell's editorial work.<ref name=dab/> One daughter, [[Psyche Cattell]] (1893–1989) followed in her father's footsteps, established a small child psychology practice in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and developed tests to assess the intelligence of infants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cattell|first1=Psyche|title=The Measurement of Intelligence of Infants and Young Children|date=1940|publisher=The Psychological Corporation|location=New York, New York|edition=1st}}</ref>

==Death==
Cattell died at [[Lancaster General Hospital]] on January 20, 1944.<ref name="harrisburg">{{Cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/76993369/dr-james-m-cattell-21-jan-1944-harri/ |title=Dr. James M.
