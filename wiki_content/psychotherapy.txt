'''Psychotherapy''' (also '''psychological therapy''' or '''talking therapy''') is the use of [[Psychology|psychological]] methods, particularly when based on regular [[Conversation|personal interaction]], to help a person change behavior, increase happiness, and overcome problems. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's [[well-being]] and [[mental health]], to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and [[social skills]]. There are numerous types of psychotherapy designed either for individual adults, families, or children and adolescents. Certain types of psychotherapy are considered [[evidence-based]] for treating some diagnosed [[mental disorder]]s, and other types have been criticized as [[pseudoscience]].<ref>For example:

In contrast to most accepted medical interventions, which are prescribed for a circumscribed number of conditions, many pseudoscientific techniques lack boundary conditions of application. For example, some proponents of [[Thought Field Therapy]], an intervention that purports to correct imbalances in unobservable energy fields, using specified bodily tapping algorithms, maintain that it can be used to treat virtually any psychological condition, and that it is helpful not only for adults but also for children, dogs, and horses.}}

With only methodologically weak reports available in the literature, the so-called science cited to support TFT is primarily anecdotal and does not rule out placebo effects. Despite these criticisms, the TFT website continues to advance unsupported claims about TFT's ability to cure almost any emotional problem.}}</ref>

There are hundreds of psychotherapy techniques, some being minor variations, while others are based on very different conceptions of psychology.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McAleavey |first1=Andrew A. |last2=Castonguay |first2=Louis G. |date=2015 |chapter=The process of change in psychotherapy: common and unique factors |editor1-last=Gelo |editor1-first=Omar C.

Psychotherapists may be [[mental health professionals]] such as psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, or professional counselors. Psychotherapists may also come from a variety of other backgrounds, and depending on the [[jurisdiction]] may be legally regulated, voluntarily regulated or unregulated (and the term itself may be protected or not).

== Definitions ==
The term ''[[wikt:psychotherapy|psychotherapy]]'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Wikt:psyche|psyche]]'' ([[Wikt:ψυχή|ψυχή]] meaning "breath; spirit; soul") and ''therapeia'' ([[Wikt:θεραπεία|θεραπεία]] "healing; medical treatment"). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines it as "The treatment of disorders of the mind or personality by psychological methods...", however, in earlier use it denoted the treatment of disease through hypnotic suggestion.<ref name=OED>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/153946?rskey=jNoItF&result=1 "psychotherapy, n.".] OED Online.

The [[American Psychological Association]] adopted a resolution on the effectiveness of psychotherapy in 2012 based on a definition developed by American psychologist [[John C. Norcross]]: "Psychotherapy is the informed and intentional application of [[Clinical psychology|clinical methods]] and [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal stances]] derived from established psychological principles for the purpose of assisting people to modify their behaviors, cognitions, emotions, and/or other personal characteristics in directions that the participants deem desirable".<ref name=resolution>{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell LF, Norcross JC, Vasquez MJ, Kaslow NJ | title = Recognition of psychotherapy effectiveness: the APA resolution | journal = Psychotherapy | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–101 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23505985 | doi = 10.1037/a0031817 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236058462 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101111335/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236058462_Recognition_of_Psychotherapy_Effectiveness_The_APA_Resolution | archive-date = 1 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>APA [http://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-psychotherapy.aspx Recognition of Psychotherapy Effectiveness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729162155/http://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-psychotherapy.aspx |date=29 July 2015 }} Approved August 2012</ref> Influential editions of a work by psychiatrist [[Jerome Frank (psychiatrist)|Jerome Frank]] defined psychotherapy as a healing relationship using socially authorized methods in a series of contacts primarily involving words, acts and rituals—regarded as forms of [[persuasion]] and [[rhetoric]].<ref>Frank, J.

Some definitions of [[counseling]] overlap with psychotherapy (particularly in non-directive client-centered approaches), or counseling may refer to guidance for everyday problems in specific areas, typically for shorter durations with a less medical or 'professional' focus.<ref>[http://counsellingresource.com/lib/therapy/types/history/ History of Counselling & Psychotherapy] Greg Mulhauser, CounsellingResource Library, 2014</ref> [[Somatotherapy]] refers to the use of physical changes as injuries and illnesses, and [[sociotherapy]] to the use of a person's social environment to effect therapeutic change.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WCSunMx7EJ8C Theory and Practice of Nursing: An Integrated Approach to Caring Practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723054936/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WCSunMx7EJ8C |date=23 July 2015 }} Lynn Basford, Oliver Slevin, Nelson Thornes, 2003.

Most forms of psychotherapy use spoken [[conversation]]. Some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[Work of art|artwork]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story or music. Psychotherapy with children and their parents often involves [[Play (activity)|play]], dramatization (i.e. role-play), and drawing, with a co-constructed narrative from these non-verbal and displaced modes of interacting.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Schechter |first1= Daniel S. |author1-link= Daniel Schechter |last2= Coates |first2= Susan W. |author2-link= Susan Coates |year= 2006 |chapter= Relationally and Developmentally Focused Interventions with Young Children and Their Caregivers Affected by the Events of 9/11 |title= 9/11: Mental Health in the Wake of Terrorist Attacks |editor1-first= Yuval |editor1-last= Neria |editor1-link= Yuval Neria |editor2-first= Raz |editor2-last= Gross |editor3-first= Randall |editor3-last= Marshall |editor4-first= Ezra |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last= Susser |publisher= Cambridge University Press |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=kADL4ymHsY8C&pg=PA402 402–27] |isbn= 9781139457729}}</ref>

== Regulation ==
{{see also|Psychologist#Licensing and regulations|Counseling psychology#Counseling ethics and regulation|Psychiatrist#Professional requirements|Health professional requisites|Social work#Qualifications|Mental health professional#Professional distinctions}}
Psychotherapists traditionally may be: [[mental health professionals]] like psychologists and psychiatrists; professionals from other backgrounds (family therapists, social workers, nurses, etc.) who have trained in a specific psychotherapy; or (in some cases) academic or scientifically-trained professionals.
[[Psychiatrists]] are trained first as physicians, and—as such—they may prescribe [[drugs|prescription medication]]; and specialist psychiatric training begins after medical school in psychiatric residencies: however, their specialty is in mental disorders or forms of mental illness. [[Clinical psychology|Clinical psychologists]] have specialist doctoral degrees in psychology with some clinical and research components. Other clinical practitioners, [[social workers]], mental health counselors, pastoral counselors, and nurses with a specialization in mental health, also often conduct psychotherapy. Many of the wide variety of psychotherapy training programs and institutional settings are multi-professional. In most countries, psychotherapy training are all at a post-graduate level, often at a master's degree (or doctoral) level, over 4 years, with significant supervised practice and clinical placements. Such professionals doing specialized psychotherapeutic work also require a program of continuing professional education after basic professional training.

There is a 2013 listing of the extensive professional competencies of a European psychotherapist, developed by the European Association of Psychotherapy (EAP).<ref>Professional Competencies of a European Psychotherapist {{cite web |url=http://www.psychotherapy-competency.eu/index.php |title=The Professional Competencies of a European Psychotherapist: Home Page |access-date=25 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708052131/http://psychotherapy-competency.eu/index.php |archive-date=8 July 2017  }}</ref>

As sensitive and deeply personal topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality. The critical importance of [[client confidentiality]]—and the limited circumstances in which it may need to be broken for the protection of clients or others—is enshrined in the regulatory psychotherapeutic organizations' codes of ethical practice.<ref>Ethical Principles (2010) of the American Psychological Association, Standard 4: Privacy and Confidentiality online at {{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 April 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401172733/http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/ |archive-date=1 April 2015  }}.</ref> Examples of when it is typically accepted to break confidentiality include when the therapist has knowledge that a child or elder is being physically abused; when there is a direct, clear and imminent threat of serious physical harm to self or to a specific individual.

=== Europe ===
As of 2015, there are still a lot of variations between different European countries about the regulation and delivery of psychotherapy. Several countries have no regulation of the practice or no protection of the title. Some have a system of voluntary registration, with independent professional organizations, while other countries attempt to restrict the practice of psychotherapy to 'mental health professionals' (psychologists and psychiatrists) with state-certified training. The titles that are protected also vary.<ref name=Woelbert>[https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/psychotherapy-mental-illness-europe-exploration-evidence-base-and-status-quo Psychotherapy for mental illness in Europe: An exploration on the evidence base and the status quo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722131907/https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/psychotherapy-mental-illness-europe-exploration-evidence-base-and-status-quo |date=22 July 2015 }} Eva Woelbert, 2015, Joint Research Centre, Publications Office of the European Union</ref> The [[European Association for Psychotherapy]] (EAP) established the 1990 Strasbourg Declaration on Psychotherapy, which is dedicated to establishing an independent profession of psychotherapy in Europe, with pan-European standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychotherapy-competency.eu/Appendices/appendix1.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127013001/http://www.psychotherapy-competency.eu/Appendices/appendix1.php|url-status=live|archive-date=27 January 2011|title=Appendix 1a}}</ref> The EAP has already made significant contacts with the European Union & European Commission towards this end.

Given that the [[European Union]] has a primary policy about the free movement of labor within Europe, European legislation can overrule national regulations that are, in essence, forms of restrictive practices.

In Germany, the practice of psychotherapy for adults is restricted to qualified psychologists and physicians (including psychiatrists) who have completed several years of specialist practical training and certification in psychotherapy. As psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy meet the requirements of German health insurance companies, mental health professionals regularly opt for one of these three specializations in their postgraduate training. For psychologists, this includes three years of full-time practical training (4.200 hours), encompassing a year-long internship at an accredited psychiatric institution, six months of clinical work at an outpatient facility, 600 hours of supervised psychotherapy in an outpatient setting, and at least 600 hours of theoretical seminars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/psychth-aprv/BJNR374900998.html|title=PsychTh-APrV - Ausbildungs- und Prüfungsverordnung für Psychologische Psychotherapeuten|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928222210/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/psychth-aprv/BJNR374900998.html|archive-date=28 September 2017}}</ref> [[Social worker]]s may complete the specialist training for child and teenage clients.<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072697/ A guide to psychotherapy in Germany: Where can I find help?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101111335/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072697/ |date=1 January 2016 }} January 2013; Next update: 2016.

=== United States ===

Regulation of psychotherapy is in the jurisdiction of, and varies among, the provinces and territories.

In [[Quebec]], psychotherapy is a regulated activity which is restricted to psychologists, medical doctors, and holders of a psychotherapy permit issued by the [[Ordre des psychologues du Québec]], the Quebec order of psychologists. Members of certain specified professions, including [[social work]]ers, couple and family therapists, [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], [[guidance counsellor]]s, [[criminology|criminologists]], [[sexology|sexologists]], [[psychoeducation|psychoeducators]], and registered nurses may obtain a psychotherapy permit by completing certain educational and practice requirements; their professional oversight is provided by their own professional orders. Some other professionals who were practising psychotherapy before the current system came into force continue to hold psychotherapy permits alone.<ref>{{cite web |title=Qui pratique la psychothérapie ? |url=https://www.ordrepsy.qc.ca/qui-pratique-la-psychotherapie- |website=Ordre des psychologues du Québec |access-date=2 November 2020}}</ref>

Psychotherapy can be said to have been practiced through the ages, as medics, philosophers, spiritual practitioners and people in general used psychological methods to heal others.<ref>[http://www.electrummagazine.com/2013/03/ancient-classical-roots-of-psychology/ Ancient Classical Roots of Psychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723120858/http://www.electrummagazine.com/2013/03/ancient-classical-roots-of-psychology/ |date=23 July 2015 }} Laura Rehwalt in History of Science, Electrum Magazine, 2 March 2013</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v_2sAgAAQBAJ Modern Psychology and Ancient Wisdom: Psychological Healing Practices from the World's Religious Traditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723053023/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v_2sAgAAQBAJ |date=23 July 2015 }} Sharon G.

[[Image:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Freud, seated left of picture with Jung seated at the right of the picture. 1909]]

[[Sigmund Freud]] visited the Nancy School and his early [[neurological]] practice involved the use of hypnotism. However following the work of his mentor [[Josef Breuer]]—in particular a case where symptoms appeared partially resolved by what the patient, [[Bertha Pappenheim]], dubbed a "[[talking cure]]"—Freud began focusing on conditions that appeared to have psychological causes originating in childhood experiences and the [[unconscious mind]]. He went on to develop techniques such as [[free association (psychology)|free association]], [[dream interpretation]], [[transference]] and analysis of the [[id, ego and superego]]. His popular reputation as the father of psychotherapy was established by his use of the distinct term "[[psychoanalysis]]", tied to an overarching system of theories and methods, and by the effective work of his followers in rewriting history.<ref name=Shamdasani/> Many theorists, including [[Alfred Adler]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Anna Freud]], [[Otto Rank]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Heinz Kohut]], built upon Freud's fundamental ideas and often developed their own systems of psychotherapy. These were all later categorized as ''[[psychodynamic]]'', meaning anything that involved the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'s [[conscious]]/[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] influence on external relationships and the self. Sessions tended to number into the hundreds over several years.

[[Behaviorism]] developed in the 1920s, and [[behavior modification]] as a therapy became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were [[Joseph Wolpe]] in South Africa, M.B. Shipiro and [[Hans Eysenck]]<ref>{{cite journal  |last=Eysenck |first=Hans |author-link=Hans Eysenck | title = The effects of psychotherapy: an evaluation | journal = Journal of Consulting Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 319–24 | date = October 1952 | pmid = 13000035 | doi = 10.1037/h0063633}}</ref> in Britain, and [[John B. Watson]] and [[B.F. Skinner]] in the United States. [[Behavioral therapy]] approaches relied on principles of [[operant conditioning]], [[classical conditioning]] and [[social learning theory]] to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms. The approach became commonly used for [[phobias]], as well as other disorders.

Some therapeutic approaches developed out of the European school of [[existential philosophy]]. Concerned mainly with the individual's ability to develop and preserve a sense of meaning and purpose throughout life, major contributors to the field (e.g., [[Irvin Yalom]], [[Rollo May]]) and Europe ([[Viktor Frankl]], [[Ludwig Binswanger]], [[Medard Boss]], [[Ronald David Laing|R.D.Laing]], [[Emmy van Deurzen]]) attempted to create therapies sensitive to common "life crises" springing from the essential bleakness of human self-awareness, previously accessible only through the complex writings of existential philosophers (e.g., [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]). The uniqueness of the [[therapeutic relationship|patient-therapist relationship]] thus also forms a vehicle for therapeutic inquiry. A related body of thought in psychotherapy started in the 1950s with [[Carl Rogers]]. Based also on the works of [[Abraham Maslow]] and his [[hierarchy of human needs]], Rogers brought [[person-centered psychotherapy]] into mainstream focus. The primary requirement was that the client receive three core "conditions" from his counselor or therapist: unconditional positive regard, sometimes described as "prizing" the client's humanity; congruence [authenticity/genuineness/transparency]; and [[empathy|empathic understanding]]. This type of interaction was thought to enable clients to fully experience and express themselves, and thus develop according to their innate potential. Others developed the approach, like [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]] in the creation of [[Gestalt therapy]], as well as Marshall Rosenberg, founder of [[Nonviolent Communication]], and [[Eric Berne]], founder of [[transactional analysis]]. Later these fields of psychotherapy would become what is known as [[humanistic psychology|humanistic psychotherapy]] today. Self-help groups and books became widespread.

During the 1950s, [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] originated [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT). Independently a few years later, psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]] developed a form of psychotherapy known as [[cognitive therapy]]. Both of these included relatively short, structured and present-focused techniques aimed at identifying and changing a person's beliefs, appraisals and reaction-patterns, by contrast with the more long-lasting insight-based approach of psychodynamic or humanistic therapies. Beck's approach used primarily the [[socratic method]], and links have been drawn between ancient [[stoicism|stoic]] philosophy and these cognitive therapies.<ref name="RobertsonUS952010">{{Cite book |last= Robertson |first= Daniel |title= The Philosophy of Cognitive–Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy |year= 2010 |publisher= Karnac |location= London |isbn= 9781855757561|page=xix}}</ref>

Cognitive and behavioral therapy approaches were increasingly combined and grouped under the umbrella term [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) in the 1970s. Many approaches within CBT are oriented towards active/directive yet collaborative [[empiricism]] (a form of reality-testing), and assessing and modifying core beliefs and dysfunctional schemas. These approaches gained widespread acceptance as a primary treatment for numerous disorders. A "third wave" of cognitive and behavioral therapies developed, including [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] and [[dialectical behavior therapy]], which expanded the concepts to other disorders and/or added novel components and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] exercises. However the "third wave" concept has been criticized as not essentially different from other therapies and having roots in earlier ones as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=Stefan G.|date=1 December 2008|title=Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: New Wave or Morita Therapy?|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=280–285|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00138.x|issn=1468-2850}}</ref> Counseling methods developed include [[solution focused brief therapy|solution-focused therapy]] and [[systemic coaching]].

[[Postmodern]] psychotherapies such as [[narrative therapy]] and [[coherence therapy]] do not impose definitions of mental health and illness, but rather see the goal of therapy as something constructed by the client and therapist in a social context. [[Systemic therapy]] also developed, which focuses on family and group dynamics—and [[transpersonal psychology]], which focuses on the spiritual facet of human experience. Other orientations developed in the last three decades include [[feminist therapy]], [[brief therapy]], [[somatic psychology]], [[expressive therapy]], applied [[positive psychology]] and the [[human givens]] approach. A survey of over 2,500 US therapists in 2006 revealed the most utilized models of therapy and the ten most influential therapists of the previous quarter-century.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/magazine/populartopics/219-the-top-10 |title= The top 10: The most influential therapists of the past quarter-century |magazine= Psychotherapy Networker |date=March–April 2007 |access-date= 7 October 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110205113426/http://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/magazine/populartopics/219-the-top-10 |archive-date= 5 February 2011}}</ref>

[[Common factors theory]] addresses this and other core aspects thought to be responsible for effective psychotherapy.
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), a Viennese neurologist who studied with [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] in 1885, is often considered the father of modern psychotherapy. His methods included analyzing his patient's dreams in search of important hidden insights into their unconscious minds. Other major elements of his methods, which changed throughout the years, included identification of childhood sexuality, the role of anxiety as a manifestation of inner conflict, the differentiation of parts of the psyche (id, ego, superego), transference and countertransference (the patient's projections onto the therapist, and the therapist's emotional responses to that). Some of his concepts were too broad to be amenable to empirical testing and invalidation, and he was critiqued for this by Jaspers. Numerous major figures elaborated and refined Freud's therapeutic techniques including Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, and others. Since the 1960s, however, the use of Freudian-based analysis for the treatment of mental disorders has declined substantially. Different types of psychotherapy have been created along with the advent of clinical trials to test them scientifically. These incorporate subjective treatments (after Beck), behavioral treatments (after Skinner and Wolpe) and additional time-constrained and centered structures, for example, interpersonal psychotherapy. In youth issue and in schizophrenia, the systems of family treatment hold esteem. A portion of the thoughts emerging from therapy are presently pervasive and some are a piece of the tool set of ordinary clinical practice. They are not just medications, they additionally help to understand complex conduct.

Therapy may address specific forms of diagnosable [[mental illness]], or everyday problems in managing or maintaining [[interpersonal relationships]] or meeting personal goals. A course of therapy may happen before, during or after [[pharmacotherapy]] (e.g. taking [[psychiatric medication]]).

Psychotherapies are categorized in several different ways. A distinction can be made between those based on a [[medical model]] and those based on a [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic model]]. In the medical model, the client is seen as unwell and the therapist employs their skill to help the client back to health. The extensive use of the [[DSM-IV]], the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders in the United States is an example of a medically exclusive model. The humanistic or non-medical model in contrast strives to depathologise the human condition. The therapist attempts to create a relational environment conducive to experiential learning and help build the client's confidence in their own natural process resulting in a deeper understanding of themselves. The therapist may see themselves as a facilitator/helper.

Another distinction is between individual one-to-one therapy sessions, and [[group psychotherapy]], including [[couples therapy]] and [[family therapy]].<ref>Crago, H. (2006). [http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/html/0335216889.html ''Couple, Family and Group Work: First Steps in Interpersonal Intervention.''] Maidenhead, Berkshire; New York: Open University Press.</ref>

Therapies are sometimes classified according to their duration; a small number of sessions over a few weeks or months may be classified as [[brief therapy]] (or short-term therapy), others, where regular sessions take place for years, may be classified as long-term.

Some practitioners distinguish between more "uncovering" (or "[[Depth psychology|depth]]") approaches and more "supportive" psychotherapy. Uncovering psychotherapy emphasizes facilitating the client's insight into the roots of their difficulties. The best-known example is classical psychoanalysis. [[Supportive psychotherapy]] by contrast stresses strengthening the client's coping mechanisms and often providing encouragement and advice, as well as reality-testing and limit-setting where necessary. Depending on the client's issues and situation, a more supportive or more uncovering approach may be optimal.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 3330607|year = 2000|last1 = Misch|first1 = D.

=== Humanistic ===
{{Main|Humanistic psychology}}

These psychotherapies, also known as "[[Experiential knowledge|experiential]]", are based on [[humanistic psychology]] and emerged in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, being dubbed the "third force". They are primarily concerned with the human development and needs of the individual, with an emphasis on [[subjectivity|subjective]] meaning, a rejection of [[determinism]], and a concern for positive growth rather than [[pathology]].<ref>Maslow, A.H. (2011) "Toward A Psychology of Being" - Reprint of 1962 Edition, Martino Fine Books.</ref> Some posit an inherent human capacity to maximize potential, "the [[Self-actualization|self-actualizing]] tendency"; the task of therapy is to create a relational environment where this tendency might flourish.<ref>Stefaroi, P. (2012) "The Humanistic Approach in Psychology & Psychotherapy, Sociology & Social Work, Pedagogy & Education, Management and Art: Personal Development and Community Development", Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace, {{ISBN|978-1535271646}}.</ref> Humanistic psychology can, in turn, be rooted in [[existentialism]]—the belief that human beings can only find meaning by creating it. This is the goal of [[existential therapy]]. Existential therapy is in turn philosophically associated with [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].<ref>Deurzen, E., Kenward, R. (2005) "Dictionary of Existential Psychotherapy and Counseling", SAGE Publications.</ref><ref>Gessmann, H.W. (1996) "Humanistische Psychologie und Humanistisches Psychodrama. In: Humanistisches Psychodrama Band 4, (Hrsg.), Verlag des PIB, Duisburg</ref>

[[Person-centered therapy]], also known as client-centered, focuses on the therapist showing openness, empathy and "unconditional positive regard", to help clients express and develop their own [[self]].<ref>Rogers, C. R. (1951) "Client-Centered Therapy: Its Current Practice, Implications, and Theory", Boston: Houghton Mifflin.</ref>

Humanistic [[Psychodrama]] (HPD) is based on the human image of humanistic psychology.<ref>H.-W. Gessmann: Humanistische Psychologie und Humanistisches Psychodrama. In: Humanistisches Psychodrama. Band IV, Verlag des Psychotherapeutischen Instituts Bergerhausen, Duisburg 1996, S. 27–76.</ref> So all rules and methods follow the axioms of humanistic psychology. The HPD sees itself as development-oriented psychotherapy and has completely moved away from the psychoanalytic catharsis theory.<ref>H.-W. Gessmann: Erste Überlegungen zur Überwindung des Katharsisbegriffs im Humanistischen Psychodrama. In: Internationale Zeitschrift für Humanistisches Psychodrama. 5. Jahrgang, Heft 2, Dez 1999, Verlag des Psychotherapeutischen Instituts Bergerhausen, Duisburg, S. 5–26, ISSN 0949-3018</ref>
Self-awareness and self-realization are essential aspects in the therapeutic process. Subjective experiences, feelings and thoughts and one's own experiences are the starting point for a change or reorientation in experience and behavior in the direction of more self-acceptance and satisfaction. Dealing with the biography of the individual is closely related to the sociometry of the group.<ref>H.-W. Gessmann: Die Humanistische Psychologie und das Humanistische Psychodrama. In: Humanistisches Psychodrama. Band IV, Verlag des Psychotherapeutischen Instituts Bergerhausen, Duisburg 1996, {{ISBN|3-928524-31-3}}.</ref>

[[Gestalt therapy]], originally called "concentration therapy", is an existential/experiential form that facilitates awareness in the various contexts of life, by moving from talking about relatively remote situations to action and direct current experience. Derived from various influences, including an overhaul of psychoanalysis, it stands on top of essentially four load-bearing theoretical walls: [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological method]], dialogical relationship, field-theoretical strategies, and experimental freedom.<ref>Wheeler, G. (1991) "Gestalt reconsidered", New York: Gardner Press.</ref>

A briefer form of humanistic therapy is the [[human givens]] approach, introduced in 1998{{ndash}}99.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Tyrrell |first2=Ivan |last1=Griffin |first1=Joe |title=Psychotherapy, Counselling and the Human Givens (Organising Idea)|date=1998|isbn=978-1899398959}}</ref> It is a solution-focused intervention based on identifying emotional needs—such as for security, autonomy and social connection—and using various educational and psychological methods to help people meet those needs more fully or appropriately.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maslow|first1=A.

=== Insight-oriented ===
{{Main|Insight-oriented psychotherapy}}

[[Insight-oriented psychotherapy|Insight-oriented psychotherapies]] focus on revealing or interpreting [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] processes. Most commonly referring to [[psychodynamic therapy]], of which [[psychoanalysis]] is the oldest and most intensive form, these applications of [[depth psychology]] encourage the verbalization of all the patient's thoughts, including [[Free association (psychology)|free associations]], fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst formulates the nature of the past and present unconscious conflicts which are causing the patient's symptoms and character problems.

There are six main schools of psychoanalysis, which all influenced psychodynamic theory:<ref>[http://psychcentral.com/lib/psychodynamic-therapy/ Psychodynamic Therapy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722084213/http://psychcentral.com/lib/psychodynamic-therapy/ |date=22 July 2015 }} J.

Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> Techniques for analytic [[group therapy]] have also developed.

=== Cognitive-behavioral ===
{{Main|Cognitive behavioral therapy}}

[[Behavior therapy|Behavior therapies]] use [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] techniques, including [[applied behavior analysis]] (also known as [[behavior modification]]), to change maladaptive patterns of behavior to improve emotional responses, cognitions, and interactions with others. [[Functional analytic psychotherapy]] is one form of this approach. By nature, behavioral therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused on the environment and context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behavior ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behavior as statistically predictable), [[monistic]] (rejecting mind-body dualism and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analyzing bidirectional interactions).<ref>{{cite book |last1= Sundberg |first1= Norman D. |last2= Winebarger |first2= Allen A. |last3= Taplin |first3= Julian R.| title = Clinical Psychology: Evolving Theory, Practice, and Research | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ | year = 2001 |edition= 4th | isbn = 9780130871190}}{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>

[[Cognitive therapy]] focuses directly on changing the thoughts, in order to improve the emotions and behaviors.

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] attempts to combine the above two approaches, focused on the construction and reconstruction of people's [[cognition]]s, [[emotions]] and [[behavior]]s. Generally in CBT, the therapist, through a wide array of modalities, helps clients assess, recognize and deal with problematic and dysfunctional ways of thinking, emoting and behaving.

The concept of "third wave" psychotherapies reflects an influence of [[Eastern philosophy in clinical psychology]], incorporating principles such as [[meditation]] into interventions such as [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]], [[acceptance and commitment therapy]], and [[dialectical behavior therapy]] for [[borderline personality disorder]].<ref name=lebow/>

[[Interpersonal psychotherapy]] (IPT) is a relatively brief form of psychotherapy (deriving from both CBT and [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]] approaches) that has been increasingly studied and endorsed by guidelines for some conditions. It focuses on the links between [[mood (psychology)|mood]] and social circumstances, helping to build social skills and social support.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Markowitz JC, Weissman MM | title = Interpersonal psychotherapy: past, present and future | journal = Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–105 | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22331561 | pmc = 3427027 | doi = 10.1002/cpp.1774 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It aims to foster adaptation to current interpersonal roles and situations.

[[Exposure and response prevention]] (ERP) is primarily deployed by therapists in the treatment of [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]]. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) state that CBT drawing primarily on behavioral techniques (such as ERP) has the "strongest evidence base" among psychosocial interventions.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Simpson|first1=H. Blair|last2=Koran|first2=Lorrin M.|date=March 2013|title=Guideline Watch: Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder|url=https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd-watch.pdf|website=Psychiatry Online|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}</ref> By confronting feared scenarios (i.e., exposure) and refraining from performing rituals (i.e., responsive prevention), patients may gradually feel less distress in confronting feared stimuli, while also feeling less inclination to use rituals to relieve that distress. Typically, ERP is delivered in "hierarchical fashion", meaning patients confront increasingly anxiety-provoking stimuli as they progress through a course of treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How I Treat OCD - By Bradley C.

Other types include [[reality therapy]]/[[Glasser's choice theory|choice theory]], [[multimodal therapy]], and therapies for specific disorders including [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] therapies such as [[cognitive processing therapy]] and [[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]]; [[Substance use disorder|substance abuse]] therapies such as [[relapse prevention]] and [[contingency management]]; and [[co-occurring disorders]] therapies such as Seeking Safety.<ref>{{cite book |last=Najavits |first=Lisa M. |chapter=Seeking Safety: an implementation guide |editor1-last=Springer |editor1-first=David W. |editor2-last=Rubin |editor2-first=Allen |date=2009 |title=Substance abuse treatment for youth and adults |series=Clinician's guide to evidence-based practice series |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jZE8kmQvPrEC&pg=PA311 311–347] |isbn=9780470244531 |oclc=303076493}}</ref>

=== Systemic ===
{{Main|Systemic therapy}}
[[File:Gruppovaya-psihoterapiya.jpg|thumb|right|Group therapy, Ukraine]]
[[Systemic therapy]] seeks to address people not just individually, as is often the focus of other forms of therapy, but in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups, their patterns and dynamics (includes [[family therapy]] and [[marriage counseling]]). [[Community psychology]] is a type of systemic psychology.

The term [[group therapy]] was first used around 1920 by [[Jacob L. Moreno]], whose main contribution was the development of [[psychodrama]], in which groups were used as both cast and audience for the exploration of individual problems by reenactment under the direction of the leader. The more analytic and exploratory use of groups in both hospital and out-patient settings was pioneered by a few European psychoanalysts who emigrated to the US, such as [[Paul Schilder]], who treated severely neurotic and mildly psychotic out-patients in small groups at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The power of groups was most influentially demonstrated in Britain during the Second World War, when several psychoanalysts and psychiatrists proved the value of group methods for officer selection in the War Office Selection Boards. A chance to run an Army psychiatric unit on group lines was then given to several of these pioneers, notably [[Wilfred Bion]] and Rickman, followed by [[S. H. Foulkes]], Main, and Bridger. The [[Northfield Hospital]] in Birmingham gave its name to what came to be called the two "Northfield Experiments", which provided the impetus for the development since the war of both social therapy, that is, the [[therapeutic community]] movement, and the use of small groups for the treatment of neurotic and personality disorders. Today group therapy is used in clinical settings and in private practice settings.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Gessmann |first= Hans-Werner |author-link= Hans-Werner Gessmann |year= 2011 |title= Empirischer Beitrag zur Prüfung der Wirksamkeit psychodramatischer Gruppenpsychotherapie bei NeurosepatientInnen (ICD-10: F3, F4) |trans-title= The effects of psychodramatic group psychotherapy with neurosis patients — An empirical contribution (ICD-10: F3, F4) |journal= Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie |volume= 10 |issue= 1 suppl |pages= 69–87 |doi= 10.1007/s11620-011-0128-3 |s2cid= 141232001 |language= de}}</ref>

=== Expressive ===
{{Main|Expressive therapy}}

Expressive psychotherapy is a form of therapy that utilizes artistic expression  (via improvisational, compositional, re-creative, and receptive experiences) as its core means of treating clients. Expressive psychotherapists use the different disciplines of the creative arts as therapeutic interventions. This includes the modalities [[dance therapy]], [[drama therapy]], [[art therapy]], [[music therapy]], [[writing therapy]], among others. This may include techniques such as [[affect labeling]]. Expressive psychotherapists believe that often the most effective way of treating a client is through the expression of imagination in creative work and integrating and processing what issues are raised in the act.

=== Postmodernist ===
Also known as [[post-structuralist]] or [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]]. [[Narrative therapy]] gives attention to each person's "dominant story" through therapeutic conversations, which also may involve exploring unhelpful ideas and how they came to prominence. Possible social and cultural influences may be explored if the client deems it helpful. [[Coherence therapy]] posits multiple levels of mental constructs that create symptoms as a way to strive for self-protection or self-realization. [[Feminist therapy]] does not accept that there is one single or correct way of looking at reality and therefore is considered a postmodernist approach.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_rsAdzE9KfkC Introduction to Feminist Therapy: Strategies for Social and Individual Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723045949/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_rsAdzE9KfkC |date=23 July 2015 }} 2010. Introduction pg180</ref>

=== Other ===
[[Transpersonal psychology]] addresses the client in the context of a spiritual understanding of consciousness. [[Positive psychotherapy]] (PPT) (since 1968) is a method in the field of humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapy and is based on a positive image of humans, with a health-promoting, resource-oriented and conflict-centered approach.

Hypnotherapy is undertaken while a subject is in a state of [[hypnosis]].

[[Body psychotherapy]], part of the field of [[somatic psychology]], focuses on the link between the mind and the body and tries to access deeper levels of the psyche through greater awareness of the [[physical body]] and [[emotions]]. There are various ''body-oriented'' approaches, such as Reichian ([[Wilhelm Reich]]) character-analytic [[vegetotherapy]] and orgonomy; neo-Reichian [[bioenergetic analysis]]; [[somatic experiencing]]; [[integrative body psychotherapy]]; Ron Kurtz's [[Hakomi]] psychotherapy; [[sensorimotor psychotherapy]]; Biosynthesis psychotherapy; and Biodynamic psychotherapy. These approaches are not to be confused with [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|body work]] or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods.

In practice, most experienced psychotherapists develop their own integrative approach over time.

=== Child ===
{{main|Child psychotherapy}}

Psychotherapy needs to be adapted to meet the developmental needs of children. Depending on age, it is generally held to be one part of an effective strategy to help the needs of a child within the family setting.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Skumin |first=V.

Korsakova (Moscow, Russia : 1952) |volume=91 }}</ref> Child psychotherapy training programs necessarily include courses in [[Developmental psychology|human development]]. Since children often do not have the ability to articulate thoughts and feelings, psychotherapists will use a variety of media such as musical instruments, sand and toys, crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling (books), or board games. The use of [[play therapy]] is often rooted in [[psychodynamics|psychodynamic theory]], but other approaches also exist.

In addition to therapy for the child, sometimes instead of it, children may benefit if their parents work with a therapist, take parenting classes, attend [[grief counseling]], or take other action to resolve stressful situations that affect the child. [[Parent management training]] is a highly effective form of psychotherapy that teaches parenting skills to reduce their child's behavior problems.

In many cases a different psychotherapist will work with the care taker of the child, while a colleague works with the child.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Schechter |first1= Daniel S. |author-link1= Daniel Schechter |last2= Willheim |first2= Erica | title = When parenting becomes unthinkable: intervening with traumatized parents and their toddlers | journal = [[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–53 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19242290 | doi = 10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181948ff1}}</ref> Therefore, contemporary thinking on working with the younger age group has leaned towards working with parent and child simultaneously, as well as individually as needed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Lieberman |first1= Alicia F. |last2= Van Horn |first2= Patricia |last3= Ippen |first3= Chondra G. | title = Toward evidence-based treatment: child-parent psychotherapy with preschoolers exposed to marital violence | journal = [[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] | volume = 44 | issue = 12 | pages = 1241–8 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16292115 | doi = 10.1097/01.chi.0000181047.59702.58 | url = http://empower-daphne.psy.unipd.it/userfiles/file/pdf/Liberman%20A_F_%202005.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140109182043/http://empower-daphne.psy.unipd.it/userfiles/file/pdf/Liberman%20A_F_%202005.pdf | df = dmy-all | url-status = dead | archive-date = 9 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Donner |first1= Michael B. |last2= VandeCreek |first2= Leon |last3= Gonsiorek |first3= John C. |last4= Fisher |first4= Celia B. |title= Balancing confidentiality: Protecting privacy and protecting the public |url= http://faculty.winthrop.edu/armisteadl/SchoolPsychologyResources/attachments/Donner_et_al_Balancin.pdf |journal= [[Professional Psychology: Research and Practice]] |department= Focus on Ethics |year= 2008 |volume= 39 |issue= 3 |pages= 369–76 |doi= 10.1037/0735-7028.39.3.369 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140109182529/http://faculty.winthrop.edu/armisteadl/SchoolPsychologyResources/attachments/Donner_et_al_Balancin.pdf |archive-date= 9 January 2014 |df= dmy-all |access-date= 9 January 2014 }}</ref>

=== Evaluation ===
There is considerable controversy about whether, or when, psychotherapy efficacy is best evaluated by [[randomized controlled trials]] or more individualized [[idiographic]] methods.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/science/for-psychotherapy-s-claims-skeptics-demand-proof.html |title= For psychotherapy's claims, skeptics demand proof |first= Benedict |last= Carey |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 10 August 2004 |access-date= 25 December 2016 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160419175005/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/science/for-psychotherapy-s-claims-skeptics-demand-proof.html |archive-date= 19 April 2016 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

One issue with trials is what to use as a [[placebo]] treatment group or non-treatment [[control group]]. Often, this group includes patients on a waiting list, or those receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. Researchers must consider how best to match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo-controlled studies]] in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SPPr7HN7yugC Talking Cures and Placebo Effects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723051735/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SPPr7HN7yugC |date=23 July 2015 }} David A. Jopling OUP Oxford, 29 May 2008</ref> Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or gloss over individual needs. Fonagy and Roth's opinion is that the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties.<ref>Roth A., and Fonagy P. (2005) What Works for Whom: A critical review of psychotherapy research. Second Edition. The Guildford Press</ref>

There are several formal frameworks for evaluating whether a psychotherapist is a good fit for a patient. One example is the Scarsdale Psychotherapy Self-Evaluation (SPSE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://howtherapyworks.com/the-scarsdale-psychotherapy-self-evaluation-spse/|title=The Scarsdale Psychotherapy Self-Evaluation (SPSE)|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414233901/http://howtherapyworks.com/the-scarsdale-psychotherapy-self-evaluation-spse/|archive-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> However, some scales, such as the SPS, elicit information specific to certain schools of psychotherapy alone (e.g. the superego).

Many psychotherapists believe that the nuances of psychotherapy cannot be captured by questionnaire-style observation, and prefer to rely on their own clinical experiences and conceptual arguments to support the type of treatment they practice. Psychodynamic therapists in particular believe that evidence-based approaches are not appropriate to their methods or assumptions, though some have increasingly accepted the challenge to implement evidence-based approaches in their methods.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= Silverman |first= Doris K. |title= What Works in Psychotherapy and How Do We Know?: What Evidence-Based Practice Has to Offer |journal= [[Psychoanalytic Psychology (journal)|Psychoanalytic Psychology]] |volume= 22 |issue= 2 |year= 2005 |pages= 306–12 |doi= 10.1037/0736-9735.22.2.306}}</ref>

A pioneer in investigating the results of different psychological therapies was psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]], who argued that psychotherapy does not produce any improvement in patients. He held that [[behavior therapy]] is the only effective one. However, it was revealed that Eysenck (who died in 1997) falsified data in his studies on this, fabricating data that would indicate that behavioral therapy enables achievements that are impossible to believe. Fourteen of his papers were retracted by journals in 2020, and journals issued 64 statements of concern about publications by him. Rod Buchanan, a biographer of Eysenck, has argued that 87 publications by Eysenck should be retracted.<ref>Eysenck, H. J. & Grossarth-Maticek, R. (1991).

=== Outcomes in relation with selected kinds of treatment ===
Large-scale international reviews of scientific studies have concluded that psychotherapy is effective for numerous conditions.<ref name=resolution/><ref name=Woelbert/>

One line of research consistently finds that supposedly different forms of psychotherapy show similar effectiveness. According to The Handbook of Counseling Psychology: "Meta-analyses of psychotherapy studies have consistently demonstrated that there are no substantial differences in outcomes among treatments". The handbook states that there is "little evidence to suggest that any one psychological therapy consistently outperforms any other for any specific psychological disorders. This is sometimes called the [[Dodo bird verdict]] after a scene/section in Alice in Wonderland where every competitor in a race was called a winner and is given prizes".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oF_CwsBO8kQC&pg=PA249|title=Handbook of Counseling Psychology|first1=Steven D.|last1=Brown|first2=Robert W.|last2=Lent|date=2 June 2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414010510/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oF_CwsBO8kQC&pg=PA249&redir_esc=y|archive-date=14 April 2018|isbn=9780470228289}}</ref>

Further analyses seek to identify the factors that the psychotherapies have in common that seem to account for this, known as [[common factors theory]]; for example the quality of the therapeutic relationship, interpretation of problem, and the confrontation of painful emotions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|first1=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=University in New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=978-0077349165|pages=53–54|edition=Sixth}}</ref><ref name=GreatDebate>{{cite book |title=The Great Psychotherapy Debate: The Evidence for What Makes Psychotherapy Work |first1=Bruce E. |last1=Wampold |author-link1=Bruce Wampold |last2=Imel |first2=Zac E. |year=2015 |orig-year=2001 |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780805857085 |oclc=227918397 |doi=10.4324/9780203582015}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Benish |first1=Steven G. |last2=Imel |first2=Zac E. |last3=Wampold |first3=Bruce E. |author-link3=Bruce Wampold |year=2008 |title=The relative efficacy of bona fide psychotherapies for treating posttraumatic stress disorder: A meta-analysis of direct comparisons |journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]] |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=746–58 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.10.005 |pmid=18055080}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Miller |first1= Scott D. |last2= Wampold |first2= Bruce E. |author-link2= Bruce Wampold |last3= Varhely |first3= Katelyn |year= 2008 |title= Direct comparisons of treatment modalities for youth disorders: A meta-analysis |url= http://scottdmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/Direct%20Comparisons%20%28Journal%20Copy%29.pdf |journal= [[Psychotherapy Research]] |volume= 18 |issue= 1 |pages= 5–14 |pmid= 18815962 |doi= 10.1080/10503300701472131 |s2cid= 13004118 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140109200806/http://scottdmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/Direct%20Comparisons%20%28Journal%20Copy%29.pdf |archive-date= 9 January 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

Outcome studies have been critiqued for being too removed from real-world practice in that they use carefully selected therapists who have been extensively trained and monitored, and patients who may be non-representative of typical patients by virtue of strict inclusionary/exclusionary criteria. Such concerns impact the [[Replication crisis|replication]] of research results and the ability to generalize from them to practicing therapists.<ref name=GreatDebate/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leichsenring F, Abbass A, Hilsenroth MJ, Leweke F, Luyten P, Keefe JR, Midgley N, Rabung S, Salzer S, Steinert C | title = Biases in research: risk factors for non-replicability in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy research | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1000–1011 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27955715 | doi = 10.1017/s003329171600324x | s2cid = 1872762 | df = dmy-all | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1532689/1/Replicability%2033%20Psychological%20Medicine.pdf }}</ref>

The Helsinki Psychotherapy Study was one of several large long-term clinical trials of psychotherapies that have taken place. Anxious and depressed patients in two short-term therapies (solution-focused and brief psychodynamic) improved faster, but five years long-term psychotherapy and psychoanalysis gave greater benefits. Several patient and therapist factors appear to predict suitability for different psychotherapies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Knekt P, Lindfors O, Sares-Jäske L, Virtala E, Härkänen T | title = Randomized trial on the effectiveness of long- and short-term psychotherapy on psychiatric symptoms and working ability during a 5-year follow-up | journal = Nordic Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–68 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22563790 | doi = 10.3109/08039488.2012.680910 | s2cid = 30877764 | url = https://www.thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/research-and-expertwork/projects-and-programmes/helsinki-psychotherapy-study/results }}</ref>

=== Mechanisms of change ===

In general, processes of [[Arousal|emotional arousal]] and [[memory]] have long been held to play an important role. One theory combining these aspects proposes that permanent change occurs to the extent that the neuropsychological mechanism of [[Memory consolidation#Reconsolidation|memory reconsolidation]] is triggered and is able to incorporate new emotional experiences.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Centonze |first1=Diego |last2=Siracusano |first2=Alberto |last3=Calabresi |first3=Paolo |last4=Bernardi |first4=Giorgio |date=October 2005 |title=Removing pathogenic memories: a neurobiology of psychotherapy |journal=[[Molecular Neurobiology]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=123–132 |doi=10.1385/MN:32:2:123 |pmid=16215277|s2cid=20176022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ecker |first1=Bruce |last2=Ticic |first2=Robin |last3=Hulley |first3=Laurel |date=2012 |title=Unlocking the Emotional Brain: Eliminating Symptoms at Their Roots Using Memory Reconsolidation |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415897167 |oclc=772112300 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQpd13K0gHUC}} But for a more hesitant view of the role of memory reconsolidation in psychotherapy that criticizes some of the claims of Ecker et al., see: {{cite journal |last=Alberini |first=Cristina M. |author-link1=Cristina Alberini |date=April 2015 |title=Commentary on Tuch |journal=[[Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association]] |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=317–330 |doi=10.1177/0003065115579720 |pmid=25922379|s2cid=207597244 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Welling |first=Hans |date=June 2012 |title=Transformative emotional sequence: towards a common principle of change |journal=[[Journal of Psychotherapy Integration]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=109–136 |doi=10.1037/a0027786 |url=http://www.integra.pt/textos/tes.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035355/http://www.integra.pt/textos/tes.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015  |citeseerx=10.1.1.1004.236 }}</ref><ref>For a more hesitant view of the role of memory reconsolidation in psychotherapy, see the objections in some of the invited comments in: {{cite journal |last1=Lane |first1=Richard D. |last2=Ryan |first2=Lee |last3=Nadel |first3=Lynn |author-link3=Lynn Nadel |last4=Greenberg |first4=Leslie S. |author-link4=Les Greenberg |date=2015 |title=Memory reconsolidation, emotional arousal and the process of change in psychotherapy: new insights from brain science |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=38 |pages=e1 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X14000041 |url=http://www.coherencetherapy.org/files/Ecker-etal_2015_Minding-the-Findings.pdf |pmid=24827452 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022253/http://www.coherencetherapy.org/files/Ecker-etal_2015_Minding-the-Findings.pdf |archive-date=17 November 2015  }}</ref>

=== Adherence ===
Patient [[Compliance (medicine)|adherence]] to a course of psychotherapy—continuing to attend sessions or complete tasks—is a major issue.

The dropout level—early termination—ranges from around 30% to 60%, depending partly on how it is defined. The range is lower for research settings for various reasons, such as the selection of clients and how they are inducted. Early termination is associated on average with various demographic and clinical characteristics of clients, therapists and treatment interactions.<ref name=adherence>Jennifer L. Strauss, Vito S.

Most psychologists use between-session tasks in their general therapy work, and cognitive behavioral therapies in particular use and see them as an "active ingredient". It is not clear how often clients do not complete them, but it is thought to be a pervasive phenomenon.<ref name=adherence/>

From the other side, the adherence of therapists to therapy protocols and techniques—known as "treatment integrity" or "fidelity"—has also been studied, with complex mixed results.<ref>{{cite book |author1= Dinger Ulrike |author2= Zilcha-Mano Sigal |author3= Dillon Justina |author4= Barber Jacques P |year= 2015 |title = Therapist Adherence and Competence in Psychotherapy Research |journal= The Encyclopedia of Clinical Psychology |pages= 1–5|doi= 10.1002/9781118625392.wbecp340 |isbn= 9781118625392 }}</ref> In general,  however, it is a hallmark of evidence-based psychotherapy to use fidelity monitoring as part of therapy outcome trials and ongoing quality assurance in clinical implementation.

=== Adverse effects ===
Research on [[adverse effect]]s of psychotherapy has been limited, yet worsening of symptoms may be expected to occur in 3% to 15% of patients, with variability across patient and therapist characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hardy |first1=Gillian E. |last2=Bishop-Edwards |first2=Lindsey |last3=Chambers |first3=Eleni |last4=Connell |first4=Janice |last5=Dent-Brown |first5=Kim |last6=Kothari |first6=Gemma |last7=O'hara |first7=Rachel |last8=Parry |first8=Glenys D. |date=April 2019 |title=Risk factors for negative experiences during psychotherapy |journal=[[Psychotherapy Research]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=403–414 |pmid=29078740 |doi=10.1080/10503307.2017.1393575 |s2cid=22336500 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/123234/3/NegTherapyExperiences%20Accepted%20version%20.pdf |quote=Estimates of 'unwanted effects,' including long-lasting effects, of psychotherapy have ranged from 3% to 15%.

Many resources available to a person experiencing emotional distress—the friendly support of friends, peers, family members, clergy contacts, personal reading, healthy exercise, research, and independent coping—all present considerable value. Critics note that humans have been dealing with crises, navigating severe social problems and finding solutions to life problems long before the advent of psychotherapy.<ref>{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Furedi |author-link=Frank Furedi |year=2004 |edition=Reprint |title=Therapy culture: cultivating vulnerability in an uncertain age |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |isbn=9780415321600 |oclc=52166272}}</ref>

On the other hand, some argue psychotherapy is under-utilized and under-researched by contemporary psychiatry despite offering more promise than stagnant medication development. In 2015, the US [[National Institute of Mental Health]] allocated only 5.4% of its budget to new clinical trials of psychotherapies (medication trials are largely funded by [[pharmaceutical companies]]), despite plentiful evidence they can work and that patients are more likely to prefer them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=Richard A. |date=19 July 2015 |title=Psychiatry's identity crisis |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=SR5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/opinion/psychiatrys-identity-crisis.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231043810/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/opinion/psychiatrys-identity-crisis.html |archive-date=31 December 2016  }}</ref>

Some Christians, such as theologian [[Thomas C.
