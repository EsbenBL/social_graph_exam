After his presidency, he was appointed to a five-year term (2003–2008) as professor-at-large at [[Brown University]]'s [[Watson Institute for International Studies]], where he is now on the board of overseers.

==Academic career==
Cardoso earned a bachelor's degree in [[Social Sciences]] from [[Universidade de São Paulo]] in 1952, from where he also earned a Master's and a Doctorate in Sociology. His doctoral thesis, under the supervision of [[Florestan Fernandes]], examined the institution of slavery in Southern Brazil, critiquing, from a Marxist perspective, the dominant approach of [[Gilberto Freyre]] to the topic. It has since become a classic on the subject. Cardoso has also received the Livre-Docência degree in 1963, the most senior level of academic recognition in Brazil, also from Universidade de São Paulo. In 1968, he received the title of [[Academic ranks in Brazil|Cathedratic Professor]], holding the chair of Political Science at Universidade de São Paulo.<ref name="brown-biography"/>

As he continued his academic career abroad in Chile and France after the tightening of Brazilian military dictatorship, Cardoso published several books and papers on state bureaucracy, industrial elites and, particularly, [[dependency theory]]. His work on dependency would be his most acclaimed contribution to sociology and development studies, especially in the United States.<ref name="larr">{{cite journal | title=Plus ca Change...: The English Edition of Cardoso and Faletto's Dependencia y Desarrollo en America Latina | author=Packenham, Robert A. | journal=Latin American Research Review | year=1982 | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=131–151 | issn=0023-8791  | jstor=2502945 }}{{subscription needed}}</ref> After presiding the International Sociological Association from 1982 to 1986 Cardoso was selected as a Fulbright Program 40th anniversary distinguished fellow and in that capacity was a visiting scholar and lectured at [[Columbia University]] on democracy in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://members.fulbright.org/?prize_cardosa | title=Fernando Henrique Cardoso | publisher=Fulbright Association | access-date=11 November 2014}}</ref> Cardoso currently gives speeches and classes abroad.<ref name="interview-josoares">{{cite interview|title=Programa do Jô com Fernando Henrique Cardoso (FHC) |access-date=11 November 2014 |last=Cardoso |first=Fernando Henrique |subject-link=Fernando Henrique Cardoso |interviewer=[[Jô Soares]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYLOLP0ANEg |language=pt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122162156/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYLOLP0ANEg |archive-date=22 January 2014 }}</ref> In June 2013 he was elected as a member of [[Academia Brasileira de Letras]].

==Elections==
After his return to Brazil, Fernando Henrique engaged with the burgeoning democratic opposition to the military-dominated regime both as an intellectual and as a political activist. He became [[Senate of Brazil|Senator]] from [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] for the former [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB) in 1982, replacing Franco Montoro, the newly-elected governor of São Paulo. In 1985, he ran unsuccessfully for [[List of mayors of São Paulo|mayor of São Paulo]] against former President [[Jânio Quadros]]. Ahead in the polls, he let himself be photographed in the mayor's chair before the elections. Some attribute his loss to this episode.<ref name="nyt-brasiliajournal">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/14/world/brasilia-journal-brazil-s-professor-politician-he-stoops-to-kisses.html | title=Brasilia Journal; Brazil's Professor-Politician: He Stoops to Kisses | work=The New York Times | date=14 March 1988 | access-date=14 November 2014 | author=Riding, Alan}}</ref>

Elected to the Senate in 1986 for the [[Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (PMDB), which MDB became after re-democratization, he joined a group of PMDB parliamentarians who left that party to found the Brazilian Social Democratic Party ([[Brazilian Social Democratic Party|PSDB]]) after previously-held PMDB positions shifted to the right when the party filled with politicians who had collaborated with the dictatorship. As senator, Cardoso took part in the 1987–1988 National Constituent Assembly that drafted and approved Brazil's current Constitution in the wake of the country's re-democratization. In the early stages of the Constituent Assembly's work (from February to March 1987), Cardoso led the committee that drafted the internal rules of procedure, including the procedural rules governing the drafting of the Constitution itself. These rules of procedure were adopted by the Assembly and published on 25 March 1987. Until 1992, Cardoso served as Leader of the PSDB in the Senate. From October 1992 to May 1993, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under President [[Itamar Franco]] (PMDB).<ref>{{cite web |title=Fernando Henrique Cardoso Oral History |url=https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-oral-histories/fernando-henrique-cardoso-oral-history |website=Presidential Oral Histories |date=27 October 2016 |publisher=Miller Center, University of Virginia |access-date=15 January 2021}}</ref>

From May 1993 to April 1994, he was Minister of Finance and resigned in April 1994 to launch a presidential campaign. In the [[1994 Brazilian general election|3 October election]], he won the presidency in the first round of voting with 54% of the vote, more than twice that of his nearest opponent, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. This is still the largest margin of victory ever recorded in a free election in Brazilian history. After the constitution was amended to allow a president to succeed himself, he won a second term almost as easily in [[1998 Brazilian general election|1998]], taking 53% to Lula's 31.7% to win in a single round. To date, he is the only president to win an outright majority of the popular vote, and the only one to win the presidency in a single round since popular elections were reinstated in 1989.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Cardoso was succeeded in 2003 by Lula da Silva, who ran for the fourth time and had come in second on prior attempts. Lula won in the runoff election against the Cardoso-supported candidate, [[José Serra]]. Lula's election has been interpreted as resulting from Cardoso's low approval ratings in his second term.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ferreira |first1=Alex Luiz |last2=Sakurai |first2=Sérgio Naruhiko |title=Personal charisma or the economy?: Macroeconomic indicators of presidential approval ratings in Brazil |journal=EconomiA |date=1 September 2013 |volume=14 |issue=3–4 |pages=214–232 |doi=10.1016/j.econ.2013.10.006 |language=en |issn=1517-7580|doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[File:Vladimir Putin 14 January 2002-4.jpg|thumb|right|Cardoso with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in Moscow in January 2002]] Cardoso, often nicknamed "FHC", was elected with the support of a heterodox alliance of his own Social Democratic Party, the PSDB, and two right-wing parties, the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Liberal Front Party]] (PFL) and the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB). Brazil's largest party, the centrist Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), joined Cardoso's governing coalition after the election, as did the right-wing [[Progressive Party (Brazil)|PPB]], the Brazilian Progressive Party, in 1996.

Party loyalty was not always strong, and coalition members did not always vote with the government. Cardoso had difficulty at times gaining support for some of his legislative priorities, even though his coalition held an overwhelming majority of the congressional seats. Nevertheless, many constitutional amendments were passed during his presidency.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}

His presidency saw institutional advancements in human rights, beginning with a national secretariat and a new government program, discussed with the civil society, to address the issue. On 8 January 1996, he issued the controversial [[Decree 1775]], which created a framework for the clear demarcation of [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]], but which, as part of the process, opened [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] territories to counterclaims by adjacent landowners. In 2000, Cardoso demanded the disclosure of some classified military files concerning [[Operation Condor]], a network of South American military dictatorships that kidnapped and assassinated political opponents.<ref name="Huma">{{cite news | url=http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article478.html | title=Latin America in the 1970s: "Operation Condor", an International Organization for Kidnapping Opponents | work=l’Humanité in English | date=1 January 2007 | access-date=12 November 2014 | author=Devienne, Gérard | archive-date=7 July 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200707162341/http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/article478.html | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Cardoso's administration deepened the privatization program launched by president [[Fernando Collor de Mello]]. During his first term, several government-owned enterprises in areas such as steel milling, telecommunications and mining, such as  ''[[Telebras]]'' and ''[[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]]'' were sold to the private sector, the deepest denationalisation in Brazilian history, amidst a polarized political debate between "neoliberals" and "developmentalists". Ironically, this time Cardoso was against the latter group, generating uproar among former academic colleagues and political allies who accused him of reneging his previous intellectual work. Economists still contend over its long-term effects; some research suggests that companies sold by the government achieved better profitability as a result of their disengagement from the state.<ref name="revistabras-economia">{{cite journal | title=Os efeitos da privatização sobre o desempenho econômico e financeiro das empresas privatizadas |author1=Anuatti-Neto, Francisco |author2=Barossi-Filho, Milton |author3=Carvalho, Antonio Gledson de |author4=Macedo, Roberto | journal=Revista Brasileira de Economia |date=April–June 2005 | volume=59 | issue=2 | pages=151–175 | issn=0034-7140|language=pt | doi=10.1590/s0034-71402005000200001| doi-access=free }}</ref>

Despite the sale of public assets, the years 1995 to 2002 saw a rise of the total public debt from 30%  to 55.5% of GDP. Economists aligned with his government argued that this was due to external factors outside the control of the administration at the time, such as the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the growth of the share of the debt denominated in US dollars.<ref>{{cite web | title=Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability: Cardoso's Brazil, 1995–2002

</ref> Nevertheless, [[devaluation]] of the currency was an instrument of [[monetary policy]] used right after his reelection, when the real pegged to the dollar led to a financial crisis that saw the country lose much of its foreign reserve fund and raise its interest rates on government bonds to very high levels as he tried to stabilize the currency under a new free-floating regime. With this economic shift, the greatest achievement of Cardoso – his landmark lowering of inflation – was maintained, but his popularity plummeted.

Given his previous experience as Minister of Foreign Affairs and his prestige as an internationally famous sociologist, he was respected on the world scene, building friendships with such leaders as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. Although he was respected abroad, in Brazil he had problems gaining support in Congress for government priorities and among people in general. As a result, major reforms planned by the [[executive branch]], such as changes in the tax system and to [[social security]], were only partially approved and only after long discussion. Although claiming to still support [[social democracy]], his economic policies led people on the left to identify him with [[neoliberalism]] and [[right-wing politics]], terms that often carry a [[Pink tide|very negative connotation]] in Latin American political debate and academic circles.

He also experienced personal problems with former ally [[Itamar Franco]], his predecessor and later became Governor of [[Minas Gerais]], a fierce opponent of his administrative reforms that saw the state lose its capacity to contract debt and forced a reduction of local government spending. Cardoso was also criticized for amending the constitution to his own benefit, allowing him to stay eight years in office. His popularity in his first four years, gained with the success of [[Plano Real]], decreased during his last four years as the currency crisis was followed by lower economic growth and employment rates, greater public debt, growing political dissent, low levels of investment in appropriate infrastructure, and, finally, an energy crisis caused by an unexpected drought, as over 80% of Brazil's electricity is hydroelectric. He publicly admitted that he could have done more for [[public security]] and for the creation of new jobs, but defended his policies in areas such as health and education.

Cardoso's administration was accused of bribing congressmen to pass a constitutional amendment that secured FHC the right to seek a reelection, which he eventually won.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/05/22/2-brazilians-quit-congress-in-bribe-probe/86d23950-50f9-4ff5-8ad4-25d2a34b8b66/|title=2 BRAZILIANS QUIT CONGRESS IN BRIBE PROBE|first=Peter|last=Muello|date=22 May 1997|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

After stepping down from office, he assumed a position as a senior leader of his party and leading public voice in the opposition to the incumbent [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], writing extensively on Brazilian politics for newspapers and giving lectures and interviews. Nevertheless, his relatively low popularity rates among the general population have made his legacy a mixed blessing to his political allies, who are somewhat reluctant to embrace it wholeheartedly during elections, especially on topics regarding privatization and social policy. In 2006, he helped the campaign of the PSDB candidate for the Presidency, [[Geraldo Alckmin]], and has reiterated that he does not wish to run for office again.
