He secured a bachelor's degree in economics from [[Ramnarain Ruia College]], affiliated to the [[University of Mumbai]], and then pursued a master's degree in economics from the Department of Economics (now called the Mumbai School of Economics and Public Policy) of University of Mumbai, after which he won a scholarship to [[University of Pennsylvania]] in August 1960.

He became a lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1965 and professor of economics in 1983. At the LSE, he taught [[econometrics]], [[macroeconomics]], [[Marxian economics]] and [[development economics]] over the years.<ref name="LSE Blogs">{{cite web |date= 10 September 2012|title=Lord Meghnad Desai: Arguing about the world|url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/southasia/2012/09/10/lord-meghnad-desai-arguing-about-the-world/|publisher=LSE Blogs|access-date=22 November 2020}}</ref> From 1990 to 1995, he headed LSE’s Development Studies Institute and lead LSE Global Governance from 1992 to 2003.<ref name="LSE Blogs"/>

Desai wrote his first book ''Marxian Economic Theory'' in 1973 followed by ''Applied Econometrics'' in 1976 and ''Marxian Economics'', a revised edition of his 1973 book in 1979.  He wrote ''Testing Monetarism'', a critique of [[monetarism]], in 1981.

In the 1970s, he taught an idiosyncratic version of economic principles to freshers at the LSE (starting with [[Piero Sraffa]]).

Desai has written extensively publishing over 200 articles in academic journals and had a regular column in the British radical weekly ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' during 1985–1994, in the Indian business daily ''Business Standard'' (1995–2001) and in ''Indian Express'' and ''Financial Express''.  From 1984 to 1991, he was co-editor of the ''Journal of Applied [[Econometrics]]''.  A selection of his academic papers was published in two volumes as ''The Selected Essays of Meghnad Desai'' in 1995.

In 2002, Desai's book ''[[Marx's Revenge]]: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism'' stated that [[globalisation]] would tend toward the revival of socialism. Desai analyses some of Marx's lesser known writings and argues that his theories enhance our understanding of modern capitalism and globalization. His work was well received, with [[The Guardian]] stating 'If only socialists had studied Marx properly, they would have known all along that capitalism would triumph. Meghnad Desai gets behind the slogans in Marx's Revenge'.

Desai published a biography of Indian film star [[Dilip Kumar]] entitled ''Nehru's Hero: Dilip Kumar in the life of India'' (Roli, 2004). He has described the book as his "greatest achievement". Examining Kumar's films&nbsp;– some of which Desai has seen more than 15 times&nbsp;– he discovers parallels between the socio-political arena in India and its reflection on screen. He discusses issues as varied as censorship, the iconic values of Indian [[machismo]], [[cultural identity]] and [[secularism]], and analyses how the films portrayed a changing India at that time.

In 2003, Desai retired as Director of the Centre for the Study of [[global governance]], which he founded in 1992 at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), where he is now professor emeritus. He was chairman of the Trustee's Board for Training for Life, Chairman of the Management Board of City Roads and on the Board of ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' magazine.  Lord Desai was also a founding member of the Development Studies Institute (DESTIN) at the LSE in 1990.

Desai retired from the LSE in 2003. Since then he has published ''Rethinking Islamism: Ideology of the New Terror'' (2006), ''The Route to All Evil: The Political Economy of [[Ezra Pound]]'' (2007), a novel ''Dead on Time'', (2009) and ''The Rediscovery of India'' (2009).

Lord Desai serves as the founder chairman of the Meghnad Desai Academy of Economics in Mumbai (MDAE).<ref>http://www.meghnaddesaiacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MDAE_Brochure.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date=May 2021}}</ref> MDAE offers a one-year post-graduate diploma in economics, offered jointly with Department of Economics (Autonomous), University of Mumbai.

==Saif Al-Gaddafi thesis==
{{Main|LSE Libya Links}}

In 2007, Desai was asked by the University of London to serve with Tony McGrew of the [[University of Southampton]] as one of the two examiners of the PhD thesis of [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], the son of the then leader of Libya. They did not immediately accept the thesis, as it was found to be weak. The candidate was subjected to an oral examination for two and a half hours and Gaddafi was asked to revise and re-submit it.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/04/lse-heavy-price-saif-gaddafis-phd | work=The Guardian | first=Meghnad | last=Desai | title=LSE is paying a heavy price for Saif Gaddafi's PhD | date=4 March 2011}}</ref> The revised version was subsequently accepted.

Desai is chairman of the [[Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum]] (OMFIF) Advisory Board, an independent financial think tank which serves as a neutral, non-lobbying platform for exchanges among official institutions and private sector counterparties worldwide.

==Personal life==
In 1970, Desai married his LSE colleague Gail Wilson, his first wife. She was the daughter of [[George Ambler Wilson]], [[CBE]]. They had three children.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Desai and 47-year-old Ahluwalia were both divorced and married at a registrar's office in London.<ref name=toi04>{{cite news |title=Lord Meghnad weds his lady love|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-07-20/rest-of-world/27154824_1_lord-meghnad-desai-simple-wedding-eminent-economist |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103092145/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-07-20/rest-of-world/27154824_1_lord-meghnad-desai-simple-wedding-eminent-economist |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 January 2013 |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date= 20 July 2004 }}</ref>
