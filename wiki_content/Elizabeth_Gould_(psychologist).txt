Gould discovered evidence of [[adult neurogenesis]] in the [[hippocampus]] and [[olfactory bulb]] of [[rat]]s, [[marmoset]]s  and [[macaque|macaque monkeys]]. In her early studies, she laid the groundwork for understanding the relationship between stress and [[adult neurogenesis]]. Specifically, she and Dr. Heather A. Cameron reported on adrenal steroid control of adult neurogenesis in rat dentate gyrus.<ref name="Cameron">{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=H.A. |last2=Gould |first2=E. |title=Adult neurogenesis is regulated by adrenal steroids in the dentate gyrus |journal=Neuroscience |date=July 1994 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=203–209 |doi=10.1016/0306-4522(94)90224-0 |pmid=7969902 |s2cid=16297590 }}</ref> Additionally, her work has provided evidence of neurogenesis in the adult primate [[neocortex]].<ref name="Reeves">{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Reeves |first2=Alison J. |last3=Graziano |first3=Michael S.

They then migrate through the white matter to the [[neocortex]], extending [[axons]]. Continual addition of neurons in adulthood apparently contributes to association neocortex functions.<ref name="Epp"/>

== Education and early research ==

Gould was born in 1962<ref name="Specter"/> and received her [[Ph.D.]] in [[behavioral neuroscience]] in 1988 at [[UCLA]]. In 1989, she joined the lab of [[Bruce McEwen]] at [[Rockefeller University]] as a  [[postdoctoral research]]er<ref name="Bear">{{cite book |editor-last1=Bear |editor-first1=Mark F. |editor-last2=Connors |editor-first2=Barry W. |editor-last3=Paradiso |editor-first3=Michael A. |title=Neuroscience : exploring the brain |date=2007 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Baltimore, MD |isbn=978-1451109542 |edition=Fourth |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75NgwLzueikC&pg=PA558  |last1=Woolley |first1=Catherine S. |chapter=Estrogen and synapses in the hippocampus |journal=978-1451109542 |page=558 }}</ref> investigating the effect of [[stress hormone]]s on [[laboratory rat|rat brains]]. Gould’s research focused on the death of cells in the hippocampus. While Gould was documenting the degeneration of these brains, she discovered evidence that pointed to the idea that the brain might also heal itself.<ref name="NARSAD"/>

== Earlier work in neurogenesis ==

Confused by this anomaly, Gould assumed she must have been making some simple [[experimental error]], and she went to the Rockefeller library, hoping she could find an explanation as to what she was doing wrong. She ended up looking through numerous papers in the Rockefeller stacks. Several 1962 papers revealed the research at [[MIT]] by [[Joseph Altman]] claiming that adult rats, cats, and guinea pigs all formed new neurons. Altman’s results had been at first ridiculed, then ignored, and quickly forgotten in favor of [[Pasko Rakic]]'s findings.<ref name="Rakic">{{cite journal |last1=Rakic |first1=P |title=Neurons in rhesus monkey visual cortex: systematic relation between time of origin and eventual disposition. |journal=Science |date=1 February 1974 |volume=183 |issue=4123 |pages=425–7 |pmid=4203022 |doi=10.1126/science.183.4123.425 |bibcode=1974Sci...183..425R |s2cid=10881759 }}</ref>

Further investigation by Gould revealed that a decade later [[Michael Kaplan (biologist)|Michael Kaplan, at the University of New Mexico]], had used an [[electron microscope]] to image neurons giving birth. Kaplan had, he believed, discovered new neurons everywhere in the [[mammalian brain]], including the cortex.<ref name="Snyder">{{cite web |last1=Snyder |first1=Jason |title=WTF! No neurogenesis in humans?? |url=http://snyderlab.com/2018/03/07/wtf-no-neurogenesis-in-humans/ |website=The Snyder Lab|date=March 7, 2018 |access-date=28 September 2018}}</ref><ref name="Specter">{{cite web |last1=Specter |first1=Michael |title=Rethinking the Brain How the songs of canaries upset a fundamental principle of science |url=http://www.michaelspecter.com/2001/07/rethinking-the-brain/ |website=Michael Specter |publisher=The New Yorker |date=July 23, 2001 |access-date=28 September 2018}}</ref>
However, other scientists continued to support [[Pasko Rakic|Rakic]]'s doctrine which denied the possibility of neurogenesis in mammals.  Kaplan is reported as remembering Rakic telling him that “Those [cells] may look like neurons in New Mexico, but they don’t in [[Yale University|New Haven]].”<ref name="self">{{cite news |last1=Lehrer |first1=Jonah |title=The reinvention of self |url=http://www.paultullis.net/Tullis/Edits_files/Seed_feb-march_Pg58-67.pdf |access-date=28 September 2018 |work=SEED |issue=February/March |date=2006|page=63}}</ref> Like Altman before him, Kaplan abandoned his work in neurogenesis.<ref name="self"/>

== Confronting Rakic's data ==

Gould spent the next eight years quantifying endless numbers of radioactive rat [[hippocampus|hippocampi]] in pursuit of [[neurogenesis]].  Gould became a member of the Princeton faculty in 1997. The very next year, in a series of papers, Gould began documenting neurogenesis in [[primates]], directly confronting Rakic’s data. She demonstrated that adult [[marmosets]] created new neurons in their brains, especially in the [[olfactory cortex]] and the [[hippocampus]].<ref name="self" /> By 1999, Rakic admitted that neurogenesis was real.<ref name="self" /> To that end he published a paper in the ''Proceedings of the'' ''[[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]'' that reported seeing new neurons in the hippocampus of macaques.<ref name="Kornack">{{cite journal |last1=Kornack |first1=DR |last2=Rakic |first2=P |title=Continuation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult macaque monkey. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=11 May 1999 |volume=96 |issue=10 |pages=5768–73 |pmid=10318959 |pmc=21935 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.10.5768 |bibcode=1999PNAS...96.5768K |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Current work ==

Gould's laboratory at Princeton studies the production of new neurons in the early [[postnatal]] and adult [[mammalian brain]]. Her laboratory explores issues related to the regulation of [[cell production]] and survival in three brain regions the [[hippocampus]], the [[olfactory bulb]] and the [[neocortex]] in rodents and primates (marmosets and macaques).<ref name="profile">{{cite web|url=https://psych.princeton.edu/person/elizabeth-gould-0|title=Elizabeth Gould|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=31 July 2017}}</ref>

Gould and her colleagues believe the answer to the question, ‘What possible function could late-generated cells serve?’ could have immense significance in neuroscience and their investigations are guided mostly by this question. Gould and her team are also endeavoring to discover how hormones modulate the production of new neurons and how experience affects new cell production and if so, through what underlying mechanisms.<ref name="profile" />

== Research by Gould and her colleagues ==
===Hormonal regulation of cell production===
Gould and her colleagues found that the [[estrogen|ovarian steroid estrogen]] enhances cell proliferation in the [[dentate gyrus]] of the adult rat. This effect can be seen following [[ovariectomy]] and [[hormone]] replacement as well as under naturally occurring changes in hormone levels. They discovered that cell proliferation peaks during [[proestrus]], a time when [[estrogen]] levels are highest. Also and conversely, [[steroid hormone]]s of the [[adrenal glands]] were found to inhibit cell proliferation in the [[dentate gyrus]] but do so indirectly via an [[NMDA receptor]]-dependent mechanism.<ref name="Tanapat">{{cite journal |last1=Tanapat |first1=Patima |last2=Hastings |first2=Nicholas B. |last3=Gould |first3=Elizabeth |title=Ovarian steroids influence cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the adult female rat in a dose- and time-dependent manner |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |date=17 January 2005 |volume=481 |issue=3 |pages=252–265 |doi=10.1002/cne.20385 |pmid=15593136 |s2cid=16185380 }}</ref>

===Experience-dependent changes in neurogenesis===
Gould’s research has shown that exposure of aversive stimuli results in a decrease in cell proliferation in the [[dentate gyrus]] of adult rats, [[tree shrews]] and [[marmoset|marmoset monkeys]]. Gould and her colleagues have shown that social stress inhibits cell production in these three species in a series of studies.<ref name="Kozorovitskiy">{{cite journal |last1=Leuner |first1=B. |last2=Kozorovitskiy |first2=Y. |last3=Gross |first3=C. G. |last4=Gould |first4=E. |title=Diminished adult neurogenesis in the marmoset brain precedes old age |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=16 October 2007 |volume=104 |issue=43 |pages=17169–17173 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708228104 |pmid=17940008 |pmc=2040400 |bibcode=2007PNAS..10417169L |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Galea">{{Cite Q| Q64385755|author=Gould, E|author2=McEwen, BS|author3=Tanapat, P|author4=Galea, LA|author5=Fuchs, E|author4-link=Liisa Galea}}</ref>
Furthermore, they have discovered that exposure of adult rats to the odors of [[natural predator]]s, but not other novel odors, suppresses the proliferation of cells in the [[dentate gyrus]]. This effect was found to be dependent on [[adrenal steroid]]s because the prevention of the stress-induced rise in [[glucocorticoids]] (by [[adrenalectomy]] and replacement with low-dose [[corticosterone]] in the drinking water) eliminated the inhibitory effect of fox odor on cell production.<ref name="Opendak">{{cite journal |last1=Opendak |first1=Maya |last2=Gould |first2=Elizabeth |title=Adult neurogenesis: a substrate for experience-dependent change |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=March 2015 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=151–161 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.01.001 |pmid=25715908 |s2cid=16384656 }}</ref>

===The importance of complex environments===
Gould’s team has observed that many new cells in the [[hippocampus]] of adult rats and monkeys do not survive in animals living under standard laboratory conditions. In rodents, they discovered that these cells can be rescued by exposing the animals to more complex environments. These results they believe reflect the deprived laboratory conditions in which [[laborartory animals|experimental animals]] live. This they also suspect is a phenomenon, that is probably, even more pronounced in [[primates]] with higher social needs than in rodents. The Gould team is continuing to explore this issue by examining the brains of adult rats living in a visible [[burrow]] system and adult monkeys living in semi-naturalistic conditions with opportunities for [[foraging]] and other natural activities.<ref name="Lieberwirth">{{cite journal |last1=Lieberwirth |first1=Claudia |last2=Wang |first2=Zuoxin |title=The Social Environment and Neurogenesis in the Adult Mammalian Brain |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |date=2012 |volume=6 |pages=118 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2012.00118 |pmid=22586385 |pmc=3347626 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Leuner">{{cite journal |last1=Leuner |first1=Benedetta |last2=Gould |first2=Elizabeth |title=Structural Plasticity and Hippocampal Function |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2010 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=111–140 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100359 |pmid=19575621 |pmc=3012424 }}</ref>

===The functional role of new neurons===
Although the function of new [[neurons]] in the adult brain is as yet unknown Gould and her colleagues have begun to conjecture possibilities. So many new [[neurons]] are generated in the [[hippocampus]] and these cells appear to be a sensitive to experience, therefore it seems likely to the Gould team that they participate in [[hippocampus|hippocampal function]]. They are exploring the possibility that new neurons participate in two functions of the [[hippocampus]], learning and modulation of the stress response. They have shown that learning enhances the number of new [[neurons]] but only under certain conditions.<ref name="LaDage">{{cite journal |last1=LaDage |first1=Lara D. |title=Environmental Change, the Stress Response, and Neurogenesis: Fig. 1 |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |date=September 2015 |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=372–383 |doi=10.1093/icb/icv040 |pmid=25980567 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Furthermore they have discovered, experimental depletion of new neurons is associated with impairment in certain types of learning but not others. A decrease in the number of new neurons following treatment with [[anti-mitotic]] drugs impairs trace [[eye blink conditioning]] but not [[spatial learning]] in a [[Morris water navigation task|Morris water maze]], both hippocampal-dependent tasks.<ref name="Epp">{{Cite Q| Q36768019|author=Epp, Jonathan R.|author2=Chow, Carmen|author3=Galea, Liisa A.
