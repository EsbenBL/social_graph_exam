Libertarian economist Jeffrey Herbener, who calls Rothbard his friend and "intellectual mentor", wrote that Rothbard received "only ostracism" from mainstream academia.<ref>Herbener, J. (1995). L. Rockwell (ed.), [http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/memoriam.pdf ''Murray Rothbard, In Memoriam''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220074229/http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/memoriam.pdf |date=December 20, 2014 }}. Auburn, Ala.: [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]. p. 87</ref> Rothbard rejected mainstream economic methodologies and instead embraced the [[praxeology]] of his most important intellectual precursor, [[Ludwig von Mises]]. To promote his economic and political ideas, Rothbard joined [[Lew Rockwell]] and [[Burton Blumert]] in 1982 to establish the [[Mises Institute]] in [[Alabama]].

== Life and work ==
=== Education ===
Rothbard's parents were David and Rae Rothbard, [[Jewish]] immigrants to the United States from Poland and Russia, respectively.

Rothbard wrote of having grown up as a "right-winger" (adherent of the "[[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]]") among friends and neighbors who were "communists or fellow-travelers". He was a member of [[The New York Young Republican Club]] in his youth.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://nyyrc.com/history/|title=History|access-date=October 15, 2019|archive-date=October 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012210513/https://nyyrc.com/history/|url-status=live}}</ref> Rothbard characterized his immigrant father as an individualist who embraced the American values of minimal government, [[Free market|free enterprise]], [[Private property|private property]] and "a determination to rise by one's own merits ...

Rothbard attended [[Columbia University]], where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and a PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to [[Arthur Burns]]’s rejecting his dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbards and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's [[Council of Economic Advisors]] that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate.<ref name="Enemy"/>{{rp|pages=43–44}}<ref name=French>French, Doug (December 27, 2010) [https://mises.org/daily/4919/Burns-Diary-Exposes-the-Myth-of-Fed-Independence Burns Diary Exposes the Myth of Fed Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914010342/https://mises.org/daily/4919/Burns-Diary-Exposes-the-Myth-of-Fed-Independence |date=September 14, 2014 }}, [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]</ref> Rothbard later said that all his fellow students were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans at Columbia at the time.<ref name="Enemy"/>{{rp|page=4}}

During the 1940s, Rothbard became acquainted with [[Frank Chodorov]] and read widely in libertarian-oriented works by [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Garet Garrett]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[H. L. Mencken]], and [[Austrian School|Austrian economist]] [[Ludwig von Mises]].<ref name="Enemy"/>{{rp|page=46}} In the early 1950s, when Mises was teaching in the Wall Street division of the [[New York University Stern School of Business]], Rothbard attended his unofficial seminar. Rothbard was greatly influenced by Mises's book ''[[Human Action]]''. He attracted the attention of the [[William Volker Fund]], a group that provided financial backing to promote right-wing ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s.<ref>David Gordon, (editor), ''Strictly Confidential: The Private Volker Fund Memos of Murray N. Rothbard'', 2010; [https://mises.org/document/5777/Strictly-Confidential-The-Private-Volker-Fund-Memos-of-Murray-N-Rothbard Full text reprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914002006/https://mises.org/document/5777/Strictly-Confidential-The-Private-Volker-Fund-Memos-of-Murray-N-Rothbard |date=September 14, 2014 }} Quote from Rothbard: "The Volker Fund concept was to find and grant research funds to hosts of libertarian and right-wing scholars and to draw these scholars together via seminars, conferences, etc."</ref> The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain ''Human Action'' in a form that could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises's views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises's approval. For ten years, the Volker Fund paid him a retainer as a "senior analyst".<ref name="Enemy"/>{{rp|page=54}} As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was his book ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]'', published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard's work effusively.<ref name="Essential">{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=David |author-link=David Gordon (philosopher) |title=The Essential Rothbard |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |location=Auburn, Alabama |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-933550-10-7 |oclc=123960448 |url=https://cdn.mises.org/The%20Essential%20Rothbard_4.pdf |access-date=July 7, 2021 |archive-date=May 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210522113238/https://cdn.mises.org/The%20Essential%20Rothbard_4.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|page=14}}

=== Marriage, employment, and activism ===
In 1953, Rothbard married '''JoAnn Beatrice Schumacher''' (September 17, 1928 – October 29, 1999),<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://mises.org/library/joann-beatrice-schumacher-rothbard-1928-1999|title = JoAnn Beatrice Schumacher Rothbard (1928-1999)|date = October 30, 1999|access-date = July 20, 2020|archive-date = August 4, 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200804030902/https://mises.org/library/joann-beatrice-schumacher-rothbard-1928-1999|url-status = live}}</ref> whom he called Joey, in New York City.<ref name="Essential"/>{{rp |page=124}} JoAnn was a historian and was Rothbard's personal editor and a close adviser as well as hostess of his Rothbard Salon. They enjoyed a loving marriage and Rothbard often called her "the indispensable framework" of his life and achievements. According to Joey, the Volker Fund's patronage allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first 15 years of their marriage.<ref>Scott Sublett, "Libertarians' Storied Guru," ''Washington Times'', July 30, 1987</ref> The Volker Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to engineering students at [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]] in 1966 at age 40. The institution had no economics department or economics majors and Rothbard derided its social science department as "[[Marxism|Marxist]]", but [[Justin Raimondo]] writes that Rothbard liked teaching at Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics.<ref name= "Enemy"/>

=== Conflict with Ayn Rand ===
In 1954, Rothbard, along with several other attendees of Mises's seminar, joined the circle of novelist [[Ayn Rand]], the founder of [[Objectivism]]. He soon parted from her, writing among other things that her ideas were not as original as she proclaimed, but similar to those of [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].<ref name="Enemy" />{{rp|pages=109–14}} In 1958, after the publication of Rand's novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', Rothbard wrote her a "fan letter", calling the book "an infinite treasure house" and "not merely the greatest novel ever written, [but] one of the very greatest books ever written, fiction or nonfiction". He also wrote: "[Y]ou introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy", prompting him to learn "the glorious natural rights tradition".<ref name="Enemy" />{{rp|pages=121, 132–34}}<ref name=Burns>{{cite book|last=Burns|first=Jennifer|title=Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right|year=2009|publisher=Oxford Univ.

== Ethical and philosophical views ==
=== Austrian economics ===
{{Austrian School sidebar}}
Rothbard was an advocate and practitioner of the [[Austrian School]] tradition of his teacher [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Like Mises, Rothbard rejected the application of the [[scientific method]] to economics and dismissed [[econometrics]], empirical and statistical analysis and other tools of mainstream social science as useless for the study of economics.<ref name="mises.org">Rothbard, Murray (1976). [https://mises.org/rothbard/praxeology.pdf ''Praxeology:  The Methodology of Austrian Economics''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731160019/http://mises.org/rothbard/praxeology.pdf |date=July 31, 2014 }}. Mises.org</ref> He instead embraced [[praxeology]], the strictly ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' methodology of Mises. Praxeology conceives of economic laws as akin to geometric or mathematical [[axiom]]s: fixed, unchanging, objective and discernible through logical reasoning without the use of any empirical evidence.<ref name="mises.org"/>

According to Misesian economist [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], eschewing the scientific method and [[empiricism]] distinguishes the Misesian approach "from all other current economic schools", which dismiss the Misesian approach as "dogmatic and unscientific." [[Mark Skousen]] of [[Chapman University]] and the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], a critic of mainstream economics,<ref name="mises">{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/media/2938/Where-Modern-Economics-Went-Wrong|website=mises.org|title=Where Modern Economics Went Wrong|access-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916033639/http://mises.org/media/2938/Where-Modern-Economics-Went-Wrong|archive-date=September 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> praises Rothbard as brilliant, his writing style persuasive, his economic arguments nuanced and logically rigorous and his Misesian methodology sound.<ref name=":3">Mark Skousen.

E. Sharpe, 2009, p. 390). Skousen writes that Rothbard "refused to write for the academic journals."</ref> But Skousen concedes that Rothbard was effectively "outside the discipline" of mainstream economics and that his work "fell on deaf ears" outside his ideological circles. Paralleling Skousen's remarks, Hoppe recognizes that mainstream economists dismissed Rothbard's work as [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].

Rothbard wrote extensively on [[Austrian business cycle theory]] and as part of this approach strongly opposed [[central banking]], [[fiat money]] and [[fractional-reserve banking]], advocating a [[gold standard]] and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.<ref name="Mystery" />{{rp|pages=89–94, 96–97}}<ref name="Gordon"/><ref name="golddollar">{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/1829 |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |title=The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar |year=1991 |orig-year=1962 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |access-date=August 13, 2013 |archive-date=August 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801065845/http://mises.org/daily/1829 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/north/north769.html |title=What Is Money?

==== Polemics against mainstream economics ====
Rothbard wrote a series of [[polemic]]s in which he deprecated a number of leading modern economists. He vilified [[Adam Smith]], calling him a "shameless plagiarist"<ref>{{cite book |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |title=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |location=Auburn, Alabama |date=2006 |orig-date=1995 |isbn=0-945466-48-X |volume=2 |page=435}}</ref> who set economics off track, ultimately leading to the rise of [[Marxism]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |title=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |location=Auburn, Alabama |date=2006 |orig-date=1995 |isbn=0-945466-48-X |volume=2 |page=453}}</ref> Rothbard praised Smith's contemporaries, including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], for developing the [[subjective theory of value]]. In response to Rothbard's charge that Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' was largely plagiarized, [[David D. Friedman]] castigated Rothbard's scholarship and character, saying that he "was [either] deliberately dishonest or never really read the book he was criticizing".<ref>[[Gerard Casey (philosopher)|Casey, Gerard]] (2010). ''Murray Rothbard''. New York, NY: The Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 112. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-4209-2}}.</ref> Tony Endres called Rothbard's treatment of Smith a "travesty".<ref>Tony Endres, review of ''Classical Economics: An Austrian Perspective'', History of Economics Review, http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf-back/23-RA-7.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127064606/http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf-back/23-RA-7.pdf |date=January 27, 2014 }}</ref>

Rothbard was equally scathing in his criticism of [[John Maynard Keynes]],<ref>[https://mises.org/resources/5223/Keynes-the-Man Keynes the Man] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902064513/http://mises.org/resources/5223/Keynes-the-Man |date=September 2, 2011 }}, originally published in ''Dissent on Keynes: A Critical Appraisal of Keynesian Economics'', Edited by Mark Skousen. New York: Praeger, 1992, pp. 171–98; Online edition at The [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]</ref> calling him weak on economic theory and a shallow political opportunist. Rothbard also wrote more generally that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of money and credit created a "dismal monetary and banking situation". He called [[John Stuart Mill]] a "wooly man of mush" and speculated that Mill's "soft" personality led his economic thought astray.<ref>Gordon, David (1999). [https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=151&sortorder=issue "John Stuart Mill on Liberty and Control."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914004452/https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=151&sortorder=issue |date=September 14, 2014 }} The Mises Review</ref>

Rothbard was critical of monetarist economist [[Milton Friedman]]. In his polemic "Milton Friedman Unraveled", he called Friedman a "statist", a "favorite of the establishment", a friend of and "apologist" for [[Richard Nixon]] and a "pernicious influence" on public policy.<ref>Ruger, William (2013). Meadowcroft, John, ed. Milton Friedman. Major Conservative and Libertarian Thinkers. New York, NY: Bloomsbury. p. 174</ref><ref>Rothbard, Murray (1971).

Noting that Rothbard has "been nasty to me and my work", Friedman responded to Rothbard's criticism by calling him a "cult builder and a dogmatist".<ref>Doherty, Brian (1995). [http://reason.com/archives/1995/06/01/best-of-both-worlds/3 "Best of Both Worlds."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405013824/http://reason.com/archives/1995/06/01/best-of-both-worlds/3 |date=April 5, 2019 }} ''Reason''</ref>

In a memorial volume published by the Mises Institute, Rothbard's protégé and libertarian theorist [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] wrote that ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]'' "presented a blistering refutation of all variants of mathematical economics" and included it among Rothbard's "almost mind-boggling achievements". Hoppe lamented that, like Mises, Rothbard died without winning the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] that Hoppe says Rothbard deserved "twice over". Although Hoppe acknowledged that Rothbard and his work were largely ignored by academia, he called Rothbard an "intellectual giant" comparable to [[Aristotle]], [[John Locke]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref name="Murray Memoriam">{{cite book|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn|title=Murray N.

====Disputes with other Austrian economists====
Although he self-identified as an Austrian economist, Rothbard's methodology was at odds with that of many other Austrians. In 1956, Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist [[Fritz Machlup]], stating that Machlup was no praxeologist and calling him instead a "positivist" who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard stated that in fact Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist [[Milton Friedman]].<ref>In Defense of "Extreme Apriorism" Murray N. Rothbard Southern Economic Journal, January 1957, pp. 314–20</ref> Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920s Vienna before each relocated to the United States and Mises later urged his American protege [[Israel Kirzner]] to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirzner|first=Israel|title=Interview of Israel Kirzner|url=https://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen17_1_1.asp|publisher=Mises Institute|access-date=June 17, 2013|archive-date=February 10, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210215643/http://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen17_1_1.asp|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to libertarian economists [[Tyler Cowen]] and Richard Fink,<ref name=ERE>{{cite journal|last=Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink|title=Inconsistent Equilibrium Constructs: The Evenly Rotating Equilibrium Economy of Mises and Rothbard|journal=American Economic Review|volume=75|issue=4|pages=866–869|year=1985|jstor=1821365}}</ref> Rothbard wrote that the term evenly rotating economy (ERE) can be used to analyze complexity in a world of change. The words ERE had been introduced by Mises as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of [[static equilibrium]] and [[general equilibrium]] analysis. Cowen and Fink found "serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses". With the sole exception of Rothbard, no other economist adopted Mises' term and the concept continued to be called "equilibrium analysis".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gunning|first=Patrick|title=Mises on the Evenly Rotating Economy|journal=Journal of Austrian Economics|volume=3|issue=3|url=https://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=4|date=November 23, 2014|access-date=September 13, 2014|archive-date=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914050526/https://www.mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=4|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a 2011 article critical of Rothbard's "reflexive opposition" to [[inflation]], ''[[The Economist]]'' noted that his views are increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the right. The article contrasted Rothbard's categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of "sophisticated Austrian-school monetary economists such as [[George Selgin]] and Larry White", [who] follow [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] in treating stability of nominal spending as a monetary ideal—a position "not all that different from [[Scott Sumner|Mr [Scott] Sumner]]'s".<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/07/free-marketeers-and-inflation "free marketeers and inflation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523200054/http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/07/free-marketeers-and-inflation |date=May 23, 2017 }} ''The Economist''</ref>

According to economist Peter Boettke, Rothbard is better described as a [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] economist than as an Austrian economist. In 1988, Boettke noted that Rothbard "vehemently attacked all of the books of the younger Austrians".<ref name="Boettke Nomos">{{cite journal|last=Boettke|first=Peter|title=Economists and Liberty: Murray N.

=== Ethics ===
[[File:Ludwig von Mises.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ludwig von Mises]]]]
Although Rothbard adopted Ludwig von Mises' [[deductive]] methodology for his social theory and economics,<ref>Grimm, Curtis M.; Hunn, Lee; Smith, Ken G. ''Strategy as Action: Competitive Dynamics and Competitive Advantage''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2006. p. 43</ref> he parted with Mises on the question of ethics. Specifically, he rejected Mises' conviction that ethical values remain subjective and opposed [[utilitarianism]] in favor of principle-based, [[natural law]] reasoning. In defense of his free market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies made all of society worse off. On the other hand, Rothbard concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard argued for an objective, natural-law basis for the free market.<ref name="Essential" />{{rp|pages=87–89}} He called this principle "[[self-ownership]]", loosely basing the idea on the writings of [[John Locke]] and also borrowing concepts from [[classical liberalism]] and the anti-imperialism of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]].<ref name="Enemy"/>{{rp|page=134}}

Rothbard accepted the [[labor theory of property]], but rejected the [[Lockean proviso]], arguing that if an individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner eternally and that after that time it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.2004.00298.x|title=31 Reckoning with Rothbard|year=2004|last1=Kyriazi|first1=Harold|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=63|issue=2|pages=451–84}}</ref><!--Regarding pronoun usage in this sentence, what pronouns did Harold Kyriazi use?-->

Rothbard was a strong critic of [[egalitarianism]]. The title essay of Rothbard's 1974 book ''[[Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays]]'' held: "Equality is not in the natural order of things, and the crusade to make everyone equal in every respect (except before the law) is certain to have disastrous consequences".<ref>George C.

[[Noam Chomsky]] critiqued Rothbard's ideal society as "a world so full of hate that no human being would want to live in it{{nbsp}}...

=== Anarcho-capitalism ===
{{anarcho-capitalism sidebar}}
According to anarcho-capitalists, various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to [[anarcho-capitalism]]. However, Rothbard was the first person to use the term as in the mid-20th century he synthesized elements from the Austrian School of economics, [[classical liberalism]] and 19th-century American [[individualist anarchist]]s.<ref>''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-631-17944-3}}, p. 290; quote: "A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker."</ref> According to [[Lew Rockwell]], Rothbard was the "conscience" of all the various strains of what he described as "libertarian anarchism", because their advocates (described as Rothbard's former "colleagues"), had often been personally inspired by his example.<ref>Rockwell, Llewellyn (1995).  [http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/memoriam.pdf "Murray N.

During his years at graduate school in the late 1940s, Rothbard considered whether a strict adherence to libertarian and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' principles required the abolition of the state altogether. He visited [[Baldy Harper]], a founder of the [[Foundation for Economic Education]],<ref name="The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism by Hamowy">{{cite book|editor=[[Ronald Hamowy]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|date=August 15, 2008|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1-4129-6580-4|page=623|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC&q=libertarian+encyclopedia|access-date=November 4, 2020|archive-date=April 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415022033/https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC&q=libertarian+encyclopedia|url-status=live}}{{Cite news | last = Rothbard | first = Murray N | title = Floyd Arthur 'Baldy' Harper, RIP | work = Mises Daily | date = August 17, 2007 }}</ref> who doubted the need for any government whatsoever.

In ''Man, Economy, and State'', Rothbard divides the various kinds of state intervention in three categories: "autistic intervention", which is interference with private non-economic activities; "binary intervention", which is forced exchange between individuals and the state; and "triangular intervention", which is state-mandated exchange between individuals. According to Sanford Ikeda, Rothbard's typology "eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies that appear in Mises's original formulation".<ref>Ikeda, Sanford, ''Dynamics of the Mixed Economy: Toward a Theory of Interventionism'', Routledge UK, 1997, p. 245.</ref><ref>Rothbard, Murray.

=== Race, gender, and civil rights ===
Michael O'Malley, associate professor of history at [[George Mason University]], characterizes Rothbard's "overall tone regard[ing]" the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[women's suffrage]] movement to be "contemptuous and hostile".<ref name=":5">O'Malley, Michael (2012). ''Face Value: The Entwined Histories of Money and Race in America.'' Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press. pp. 205–07</ref> Rothbard criticized women's rights activists, attributing the growth of the [[welfare state]] to politically active [[spinster]]s "whose busybody inclinations were not fettered by the responsibilities of health and heart". Rothbard argued that the [[Progressivism|progressive movement]], which he regarded as a noxious influence on the United States, was spearheaded by a coalition of Yankee Protestants (people from the six [[New England]] states and [[upstate New York]] who were [[Protestants]] of [[English-Americans|English descent]]), Jewish women and "lesbian spinsters".<ref>Murray N.

''mises.org''.</ref>

Rothbard called for the elimination of "the entire 'civil rights' structure" stating that it "tramples on the property rights of every American". He consistently favored repeal of the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]], including Title VII regarding employment discrimination,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch69.html|title=The Great Thomas & Hill Show: Stopping the Monstrous Regiment|website=archive.lewrockwell.com|access-date=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418134336/https://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch69.html|archive-date=April 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and called for overturning the ''[[Brown v.

He also advocated that the police "clear the streets of bums and vagrants."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html|title=Right-Wing Populism|website=archive.lewrockwell.com|access-date=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524131828/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html|archive-date=May 24, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Rothbard held strong opinions about many leaders of the civil rights movement. He considered black separatist [[Malcolm X]] to be a "great black leader" and integrationist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] to be favored by whites because he "was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution".<ref name="Enemy" />{{rp|page=167}} In 1993 he rejected the vision of a "separate black nation", asking "does anyone really believe that ... New Africa would be content to strike out on its own, with no massive "foreign aid" from the U.S.A.?".<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (February 1993). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/murray-n-rothbard/their-malcolm-and-mine/ "Their Malcolm ... and Mine."] LewRockwell.com</ref> Rothbard also suggested that opposition to Martin Luther King Jr., whom he demeaned as a "coercive integrationist", should be a litmus test for members of his "[[paleolibertarian]]" political movement.<ref>Rothbard, Murray (November 1994).

=== Opposition to war ===
Like [[Randolph Bourne]], Rothbard believed that "war is the health of the state". According to David Gordon, this was the reason for Rothbard's opposition to aggressive [[foreign policy]].<ref name="Gordon"/> Rothbard believed that stopping new wars was necessary and that knowledge of how government had led citizens into earlier wars was important. Two essays expanded on these views "War, Peace, and the State" and "Anatomy of the State". Rothbard used insights of [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Gaetano Mosca]] and [[Robert Michels]] to build a model of state personnel, goals and ideology.<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph R. |last=Stromberg |url=http://antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=4296 |title=Murray Rothbard on States, War, and Peace: Part I |date=January 10, 2005 |publisher=[[Antiwar.com]] |orig-year=first published June 12, 2000 |access-date=May 1, 2009 |archive-date=August 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823091728/http://antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=4296 |url-status=live }} Also see [http://www.antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=4420 Part II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417215914/http://antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=4420 |date=April 17, 2009 }}, originally published June 20, 2000.</ref><ref>See both essays: Rothbard, Murray.

Rothbard's endorsing of World War II revisionism and his association with Barnes and other Holocaust deniers have drawn criticism. [[Kevin D.

In the ''Ethics of Liberty'', Rothbard explores issues regarding [[children's rights]] in terms of self-ownership and contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.l4l.org/library/chilroth.html |title=Children's Rights versus Murray Rothbard's ''The Ethics of Liberty'' |first=John |last=Walker |year=1991 |publisher=[[Libertarians for Life]] |access-date=August 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910134053/http://www.l4l.org/library/chilroth.html |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These include support for a woman's right to abortion, condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children.

He argued that parents have the right to put a child out for [[adoption]] or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a "flourishing free market in children". He believes that [[Child-selling|selling children]] as consumer goods in accord with market forces—while "superficially monstrous"—will benefit "everyone" involved in the market: "the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing".<ref name="Children and Rights">{{cite book|author=Murray N Rothbard|title=The Ethics of Liberty|chapter=14 "Children and Rights"|isbn=9780814775592|year=1982|publisher=LvMI|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ethicsofliberty00roth}}</ref><ref>See also: [[Ronald Hamowy|Hamowy, Ronald]] (editor) (2008).

In Rothbard's view of parenthood, "the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights".<ref name="Children and Rights"/> Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation and should be free to engage in other forms of [[child neglect]]. However, according to Rothbard, "the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, "the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum".<ref name="Children and Rights"/>

Economist Gene Callahan of [[Cardiff University]], formerly a scholar at the Rothbard-affiliated Mises Institute, observes that Rothbard allows "the logical elegance of his legal theory" to "trump any arguments based on the moral reprehensibility of a parent idly watching her six-month-old child slowly starve to death in its crib".<ref name="Callahan">{{cite journal |last=Callahan |first=Gene |date=February 2013 |title=Liberty versus Libertarianism |journal=[[Politics, Philosophy & Economics (journal)|Politics, Philosophy & Economics]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=48–67 |doi=10.1177/1470594X11433739 |s2cid=144062406 |issn=1470-594X |oclc=828009007}}</ref>

In ''The Ethics of Liberty'', Rothbard advocates for a "frankly [[Retributive justice|retributive]] theory of punishment" or a system of "a tooth (or two teeth) for a tooth".<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/thirteen.asp |chapter=Punishment and Proportionality |pages=85–97 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8147-7506-6 |access-date=September 13, 2014 |archive-date=November 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117215622/http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/thirteen.asp |url-status=live }}</ref> Rothbard emphasizes that all punishment must be proportional, stating that "the criminal, or invader, loses his rights to the extent that he deprived another man of his".<ref name=":6">Morimura, Susumu (1999). "Libertarian theories of punishment." In P. Smith & P. Comanducci (Eds.), ''Legal Philosophy: General Aspects: Theoretical Examinations and Practical Application'' (pp. 135–38). New York, NY: Franz Steiner Verlag.</ref> Applying his retributive theory, Rothbard states that a thief "must pay double the extent of theft". Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000 and says he not only would have to return the stolen money, but also provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be "put in a [temporary] state of enslavement to his victim" if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished.

==== Torture of criminal suspects ====
In chapter twelve of ''Ethics'',<ref name=SelfDefense>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/twelve.asp |chapter=Self-Defense |pages=77–84 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8147-7506-6 |access-date=September 13, 2014 |archive-date=September 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914010256/https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/twelve.asp |url-status=live }}</ref> Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police.<ref name="Callahan" /> He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard: "Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault".<ref name=SelfDefense/> Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to [[Frameup|frame]] the suspect after having tortured him or her.<ref name="Callahan" />

=== Science and scientism ===
In an essay condemning "[[scientism]] in the study of man", Rothbard rejected the application of [[causal determinism]] to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings—as opposed to those of everything else in nature—are not determined by prior causes, but by "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|free will]]".<ref>Rothbard, Murray (1960). [https://mises.org/rothbard/mantle.asp "The Mantle of Science."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914002839/https://mises.org/rothbard/mantle.asp |date=September 14, 2014 }} Reprinted from ''Scientism and Values'', Helmut Schoeck and James W. Wiggins, eds. (Princeton, N.J.: D. Van Nostrand), 1960, pp. 159–80, {{ISBN|978-0405004360}} ; ''The Logic of Action One: Method, Money, and the Austrian School'' (Cheltenham UK: Edward Elgar, 1997), pp. 3–23. {{ISBN|978-1858980157}}</ref> He argued that "determinism as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will". Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics and political science to create a "science of liberty". Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: ''[[For a New Liberty]]'', published in 1973; and ''[[The Ethics of Liberty]]'', published in 1982. In his ''[[Power and Market]]'' (1970), Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function.

== Political activism ==
Throughout his life, Rothbard engaged in a number of different political movements in an effort to promote his [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] and libertarian political principles. His first political activism came in 1948, on behalf of the [[Jim Crow laws|segregationist]] South Carolinian [[Strom Thurmond]]'s presidential campaign. In the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]], Rothbard, "as a Jewish student at Columbia, horrified his peers by organizing a Students for [[Strom Thurmond]] chapter, so staunchly did he believe in [[states' rights]]".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McCarthy |first=Daniel |date=March 12, 2007 |url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/mar/12/00027/ |title=Enemies of the State |magazine=[[The American Conservative]] |access-date=August 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605015227/http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/mar/12/00027/ |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

By the late 1960s, Rothbard's "long and winding yet somehow consistent road had taken him from anti-[[New Deal]] and anti-interventionist [[Robert A. Taft]] supporter into friendship with the quasi-pacifist [[Nebraska]] Republican Congressman [[Howard Buffett]] (father of [[Warren Buffett]]) then over to the League of (Adlai) Stevensonian Democrats and, by 1968, into tentative comradeship with the anarchist factions of the New Left".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kauffman |first=Bill |author-link=Bill Kauffman |date=May 19, 2008 |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/when-the-left-was-right/ |title=When the Left Was Right |magazine=[[The American Conservative]] |access-date=August 13, 2013 |archive-date=November 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104203634/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/when-the-left-was-right/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Rothbard advocated an alliance with the [[New Left]] anti-war movement on the grounds that the conservative movement had been completely subsumed by the statist establishment. However, Rothbard later criticized the New Left for supporting a "[[People's Republic]]" style [[Conscription|draft]]. It was during this phase that he associated with [[Karl Hess]] and founded ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'' with [[Leonard Liggio]] and George Resch, which existed from 1965 to 1968.

From 1969 to 1984, he edited ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'', also initially with Hess (although Hess's involvement ended in 1971).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/4330 |title=Karl Hess and the Death of Politics |first=Jeff |last=Riggenbach |date=May 13, 2010 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |access-date=August 13, 2013 |archive-date=October 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021020555/http://mises.org/daily/4330 |url-status=live }}</ref> The ''Libertarian Forum'' provided a platform for Rothbard's writing. Despite its small readership, it engaged conservatives associated with the ''[[National Review]]'' in nationwide debate. Rothbard rejected the view that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1980 election as president was a victory for libertarian principles and he attacked Reagan's economic program in a series of ''Libertarian Forum'' articles. In 1982, Rothbard called Reagan's claims of spending cuts a "fraud" and a "hoax" and accused Reaganites of doctoring the economic statistics to give the false impression that their policies were successfully reducing inflation and unemployment.<ref>Ronald Lora, William Henry Longton, editors, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'', Chapter "The Libertarian Forum", Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ioakmq8yxA4C&pg=PA372&dq=Murray+Rothbard+nonintervention+foreign+policy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0HT4UbrPAsKCyAHn44HIAg&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Murray%20Rothbard%20nonintervention%20foreign%20policy&f=false p. 372] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510233147/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ioakmq8yxA4C&pg=PA372&dq=Murray+Rothbard+nonintervention+foreign+policy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0HT4UbrPAsKCyAHn44HIAg&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Murray%20Rothbard%20nonintervention%20foreign%20policy&f=false |date=May 10, 2016 }}, {{ISBN|0313213909}},</ref> He further criticized the "myths of Reaganomics" in 1987.<ref name="mises3">{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/myths-reaganomics|title=The Myths of Reaganomics &#124; Mises Institute|website=mises.org|access-date=August 28, 2017|date=June 9, 2004|archive-date=October 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020062853/https://mises.org/library/myths-reaganomics|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rothbard criticized the "frenzied nihilism" of [[Left-libertarianism|left-wing libertarians]], but also criticized [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarians]] who were content to rely only on education to bring down the state; he believed that libertarians should adopt any moral tactic available to them to bring about liberty.<ref>{{cite book |first=Marvin |last=Perry |chapter=Libertarian Forum 1969–1986 |editor1-last=Lora |editor1-first=Ronald |editor2-last=Henry |editor2-first=William Longton|title=The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-21390-8 |oclc=40481045 |page=369}}</ref>

Imbibing Randolph Bourne's idea that "war is the health of the state", Rothbard opposed all wars in his lifetime and engaged in anti-war activism.<ref name="Gordon"/> During the 1970s and 1980s, Rothbard was active in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. He was frequently involved in the party's internal politics. He was one of the founders of the [[Cato Institute]] and "came up with the idea of naming this libertarian think tank after ''[[Cato's Letters]]'', a powerful series of British newspaper essays by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon which played a decisive influence upon America's Founding Fathers in fomenting the Revolution".<ref name="Burris">{{cite web |last=Burris |first=Charles |date=February 4, 2011 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/kochs-v-soros-a-partial-backstory/ |title=Kochs v.

He opposed the "low-tax liberalism" espoused by 1980 Libertarian Party presidential candidate [[Ed Clark]] and Cato Institute president [[Ed Crane (Libertarian)|Edward H Crane III]]. According to Charles Burris, "Rothbard and Crane became bitter rivals after disputes emerging from the 1980 LP presidential campaign of Ed Clark carried over to strategic direction and management of Cato".<ref name=Burris/>

Rothbard split with the Radical Caucus at the 1983 national convention over cultural issues and aligned himself with what he called the "[[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]" wing of the party, notably [[Lew Rockwell]] and [[Ron Paul]], who [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 1988|ran for president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988]]. Rothbard "worked closely with Lew Rockwell (joined later by his long-time friend [[Burton Blumert]]) in nurturing the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and the publication, ''The Rothbard-Rockwell Report''; which after Rothbard's 1995 death evolved into the website, ''LewRockwell.com''".<ref name=Burris/>

=== Paleolibertarianism ===
[[File:Lewrockwell.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Lew Rockwell]]]]
In 1989, Rothbard left the Libertarian Party and began building bridges to the post-[[Cold War]] anti-interventionist right, calling himself a [[paleolibertarian]], a conservative reaction against the [[cultural liberalism]] of mainstream libertarianism.<ref name="Paul Newsletters">{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Julian |last2=Weigel |first2=David |title=Who Wrote Ron Paul's Newsletters? |journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |date=January 16, 2008 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2008/01/16/who-wrote-ron-pauls-newsletter/singlepage |access-date=August 14, 2013 |archive-date=October 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002130521/http://reason.com/archives/2008/01/16/who-wrote-ron-pauls-newsletter/singlepage |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Rothbard, Murray (November 1994).

According to [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']], Rothbard advocated right-wing populism in part because he was frustrated that mainstream thinkers were not adopting the libertarian view and suggested that former KKK Grand Wizard [[David Duke]] and Wisconsin Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]<ref>{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |url=https://mises.org/library/strategy-right |title=A Strategy for the Right |publisher=[[mises.org]] |date=2010 |access-date=September 18, 2020 |archive-date=October 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030205243/https://mises.org/library/strategy-right |url-status=live }}</ref> were models for an "Outreach to the Rednecks" effort that could be used by a broad libertarian/paleoconservative coalition. Working together, the coalition would expose the "unholy alliance of 'corporate liberal' Big Business and media elites, who, through big government, have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic Underclass". Rothbard blamed this "Underclass" for "looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in America".<ref name="Paul Newsletters" /> Regarding the political program of the former Grand Wizard David Duke, Rothbard asserted that "nothing" in it that "could not also be embraced by paleoconservatives or paleolibertarians; lower taxes, dismantling the bureaucracy, slashing the welfare system, attacking [[affirmative action]] and racial set-asides, calling for equal rights for all Americans, including whites".<ref name="lewrockwell">{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html |title=Right-wing Populism |publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]] |date=January 1992 |access-date=August 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524131828/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html |archive-date=May 24, 2016 |url-status=dead }} Originally published in the January 1992 Rothbard-Rockwell Report.</ref>
