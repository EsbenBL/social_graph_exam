The '''University of Tehran''' ('''Tehran University''' or '''UT''', {{lang-fa|دانشگاه تهران}}) is the oldest modern university located in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. It is also one of the most prestigious universities in the [[Middle East]]. Based on its historical, socio-cultural, and political pedigree, as well as its research and teaching profile, UT has been nicknamed "The Mother University of Iran" ({{lang-fa|دانشگاه مادر}}). In international rankings, UT has been ranked as one of the best universities in the [[Middle East]] and is among the [[College and university rankings|top universities of the world]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/engineering?page=5|title=USNEWS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030180819/http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/engineering?page=5|archive-date=2014-10-30|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arwu.org |title=Academic Ranking of World Universities|publisher=ARWU|access-date=16 September 2011}}</ref><ref name="top universities">{{cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university/1089/university-of-tehran |title=University of Tehran |publisher=Top Universities |access-date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228180851/http://topuniversities.com/university/1089/university-of-tehran |archive-date=28 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is also the premier knowledge producing institute among all [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchtrends.com/issue21-january-2011/a-rebirth-of-science-in-islamic-countries/|title=A rebirth of science in Islamic countries?|publisher=Research Trends|date=26 September 2010|access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref> The university offers more than 111 [[bachelor's degree]] programs, 177 [[master's degree]] programs, and 156 [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]. programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ut.ac.ir/en/main-links/overview.htm|title=University of Tehran|language=fa|publisher=Tehran University|access-date=16 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005052636/http://ut.ac.ir/en/main-links/overview.htm|archive-date=5 October 2011}}</ref> Many of the departments were absorbed into the University of Tehran from the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar al-Funun]] established in 1851 and the [[Tehran School of Political Sciences]] established in 1899.

==History==
{{Main|History of University of Tehran}}
[[File:University of Tehran Memorial Plate.jpg|thumb|left|Opening stone of University of Tehran]]
The first official step for the establishment of the present form of University of Tehran occurred on 31 March 1931 when Minister of Court [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]] wrote [[Isa Sedigh]] who was completing his doctoral dissertation at Columbia University in New York to inquire as to requirements for the establishment of a university in Tehran.<ref>David Menashri, Education and the Making of Modern Iran (Cornell University Press, 1992) page 145</ref> Sadiq considered the letter an invitation to outline a comprehensive scheme for the establishment of a university.

In January 1933, during the cabinet meeting, the subject was brought up. [[Hekmat E Shirazi|Ali Asghar Hekmat]], the acting minister of the Ministry of Education stated the following words there:
"''Of course, there is no doubt on the thriving state and the glory of the capital, but the only obvious deficiency is that this city has no 'university'. It is a pity that this city lags far behind other great countries of the world.''"
His words had a profound impact on everyone in the meeting, resulting in the acceptance of the proposal. Thus allocating an initial budget of 250,000 Tomans, the Ministry of Education was authorized to find a suitable land for the establishment of the university and take necessary measures to construct the building as soon as possible.
Ali Asghar Hekmat in collaboration and consultation with [[André Godard]], a French skillful architect – who was serving the Ministry of Education as an engineer, promptly began looking for a suitable location for the university grounds. By the orders of [[Rezā Shāh]], the compound of Jalaliyeh garden was selected. Jalaliyeh garden was located in the north of the then Tehran between Amirabad village and the northern trench of Tehran. This beautiful garden, full of orchards was founded in the early 1900s during the final years of Nasir ad- Din Shah, by the order of Prince Jalal ad-dawlah.
The master plan of the campus buildings was drawn up by French architects Roland Dubrulle and Maxime Siroux, Swiss architect Alexandre Moser, as well as Andre Godard, Nicolai Markov and Mohsen Foroughi. The influences of early 20th century modernist architecture are today readily visible on the main campus grounds of the university.
The University of Tehran officially inaugurated in 1934. The Amir-abad (North Karegar) campus was added in 1945 after American troops left the property as World War II was coming to an end.
The university admitted women as students for the first time in 1937.<ref>[[History of the University of Tehran#cite note-5]]</ref>

In 1935, the formerly males-only university opened its doors to women as part of the country's sweeping universal education policy.<ref name=sey10>{{cite journal|last=Shojaei|first=Seyedeh Nosrat|author2=Ku Hasnita Ku Samsu|author3=Hossien Asayeseh|title=Women in Politics: A Case Study of Iran|journal=Journal of Politics and Law|date=September 2010|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.5539/jpl.v3n2p257|url=http://us-iran.org/sites/default/files/webform/userarticle-submissions/women_in_politics-iran.pdf|access-date=12 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327061122/http://us-iran.org/sites/default/files/webform/userarticle-submissions/women_in_politics-iran.pdf|archive-date=27 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Lorentz, J. ''Historical Dictionary of Iran''. 1995. {{ISBN|0-8108-2994-0}}</ref>

In 1986, the Iranian parliament, known as the Majlis of Iran, stipulated that the university's overcrowded College of Medicine be separated into the independent [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]] (TUMS), and that TUMS be placed under the leadership of the new ministry of health and Medical Education. With over 13,000 current students, TUMS remains the best medical school in Iran.

In 2011 University of Tehran with an amount equivalent to 70 million dollars got the highest budget among all universities in Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/149763/%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%AC%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86|title=بيشترين بودجه براي دانشگاه تهران|work=Tabnak|access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref>

==Emblems==
The [[emblem]] of the University of Tehran, which was designed by Dr. Mohsen Moghadam, a late faculty member of the Faculty of Fine Arts, is based on an image, which can be found in the [[stucco]] relief and seals of the [[Sasanid]] period. In this case, it is a copy from a stucco relief discovered in the city of [[Ctesiphon]].

The seal symbolized ownership. In the [[Sassanid]] period, these seals were used in stucco [[reliefs]], coins, and silver utensils as a family symbol. Since the alphabet of Sasanid [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]]'s script was used in these badges, they have the nature of a monogram as well.

The motif is placed between two eagle wings. One can also find these motifs in other images of this period, such as in royal crowns, particularly at the end of the Sasanid period. Crowns with these seals have been called "two-feather crowns" in The [[Shahnama|Shahnameh]]. The motif between the wings was made by combining Pahlavi scripts. Some scholars have tried to read these images. The script is in the form of "Afzoot" (Amrood), which means plentiful and increasing.<ref>[[commons:File:Ut logo.pdf|Logo of the University of Tehran]]</ref>

== Colors ==
University of Tehran's official color is University of Tehran Blue (RGB: 29,160,196).

==Main entrance==
[[File:University of Tehran main entrance 2019 2.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right| University of Tehran Southern and Main Entrance Gate]]
University of Tehran main entrance was designed based on more than four thousand years old Elamite linear script cow horns(No. 13 in linear Elamite script) in 1965 by Korosh Farzami, one of the students of the faculty of Fine Arts of the university. The structural engineer was an Armenian-Iranian by the name of Simon Sarkissian. Due to the importance of the university, these gates have gradually become the symbol of Iran's Higher Education system. University of Tehran gates are depicted on the reverse of the Iranian 500 rials banknote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.ir/default_en.aspx |title=Home|publisher=Cbi|access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref>

==Political role==
[[File:UT mosque minaret.jpg|thumb|right|UT's central mosque has been a center for religious and political activity in Tehran during the past 30 years]]
University of Tehran's central place in Iranian elite circles has made it the setting for many political events and cultural works. Perhaps, to historians, the University of Tehran is most notably remembered for its key roles in the political events of recent history. It was in front of the same gates of this school that [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|The Shah's]] army opened fire on dissident students, killing many and further triggering the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] of Iran. It was there and 20 years later in July 1999 that, albeit, a much smaller number of dissident students confronted the police.
University of Tehran (UT) has always been a bastion of political movement and ideology. At UT the leaders of the country deliver some of their most potent speeches often on Friday during prayers. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the main campus of the university and its surrounding streets have been the site for Tehran's [[Friday prayers]].

The political and social role of the University of Tehran in the Iranian domestic arena has continued to be so pronounced that in November 2005 (to February 2008) a senior Islamic scholar became chancellor(president) of the university, replacing Dr. Faraji-dana (professor of electrical engineering faculty). Ayatollah [[Abbasali Amid Zanjani]] (عباسعلی عميد زنجانی) is a professor in Law, is known for his strong ties to Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] in the 1979 revolution, and had spent time in the Shah's prisons before the Islamic Revolution. In February 2008, an Iranian economist, Dr. Farhad Rahbar, a former vice president of Iran and head of Management and Planning Organization of Iran, became the new (31st) chancellor of the university.

One hundred and nineteen faculty members of the University of Tehran are said to have resigned on 15 June 2009 to protest the attack on university dorms in the wake of contested [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]]:<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/06/tehran-universitys-faculty-resigns-en-masse.html|title=Tehran University's Faculty Resigns En Masse|magazine=The Atlantic|date=15 September 2009|access-date=16 September 2011}}</ref> although clear follow-up data is hard to establish, it seems that most or all resignations were not accepted.

[[Lotfi A. Zadeh]]:is a mathematician, electrical engineer, computer scientist, artificial intelligence researcher and professor emeritus of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Zadeh, in his theory of fuzzy sets, proposed using a membership function (with a range covering the interval [0,1]) operating on the domain of all possible values. He proposed new operations for the calculus of logic and showed that fuzzy logic was a generalisation of classical and Boolean logic. He also proposed fuzzy numbers as a special case of fuzzy sets, as well as the corresponding rules for consistent mathematical operations (fuzzy arithmetic). In 1942, he graduated from the University of Tehran with a degree in electrical engineering (Fanni).

He has made significant contributions to the fields of [[metamaterials]], [[transformation optics]], [[plasmonic]] optics, [[nanophotonics]], [[graphene]] photonics, nano-materials, nanoscale optics, [[nanoantennas]] and miniaturized [[antennas]], physics and reverse-engineering of polarization vision in nature, bio-inspired optical imaging, fractional paradigm in electrodynamics, and electromagnetics and microwaves.
