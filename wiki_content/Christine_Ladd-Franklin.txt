'''Christine Ladd-Franklin''' (December 1, 1847 &ndash; March 5, 1930) was an American [[psychologist]], [[logician]], and [[mathematician]].

==Early life and education==
Christine Ladd, sometimes known by her nickname "Kitty",<ref name=Ragsdale /> was born on December 1, 1847, in [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]], Connecticut, to Eliphalet, a merchant, and Augusta ([[née]] Niles) Ladd. During her early childhood, she lived with her parents and younger brother Henry (born 1850) in New York City.<ref name=Scarborough>{{cite book|last=Scarborough|first=Elizabeth|title=Untold lives : the first generation of american women psychologists|page=[https://archive.org/details/untoldlives00eliz/page/120 120]|year=1989|publisher=Columbia Univ Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231051552|author2=Furumoto, Laurel|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/untoldlives00eliz/page/120}}</ref> In 1853 the family moved back to Windsor, Connecticut, where her sister Jane Augusta Ladd McCordia was born the following year. Family correspondence shows that Augusta and one of her sisters were both staunch supporters of [[women's rights]]. Even before Ladd had celebrated her fifth birthday, her mother had taken her to a lecture given by [[Elizabeth Oakes Smith]], a well-known proponent of women's rights. Additionally, her father was a graduate professor who was supportive of his eldest daughter's education.<ref name=Furumoto/>

Following the death of her mother in spring 1860 of pneumonia, Ladd went to live with her paternal grandmother in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], New Hampshire, where she attended school.<ref name=Scarborough/> Ladd's father remarried in 1862 and there were two further children, her half-sister Katherine (born 1862) and half-brother George (born 1867).<ref name=Scarborough/> Ladd was a precocious child who sought to find "a mean to continue her education beyond secondary school."<ref name=Scarborough/> Her father enrolled her in a two-year program at the coeducational [[Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy|Wesleyan Academy]] in Wilbraham, Massachusetts; she took the same courses that prepared boys for entrance to colleges such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]].<ref name=Cadwallader>{{cite book |chapter=Christine Ladd-Franklin (1847-1930) |last1=Cadwallader |first1=J.

In 1865 Ladd graduated as [[valedictorian]] from Wesleyan Academy and pursued further education at [[Vassar College]],<ref name=Ragsdale>{{cite web|last1=Ragsdale|first1=Samantha|title=Christine Ladd-Franklin|url=http://faculty.webster.edu/woolflm/christineladd.html|website=Women's Intellectual Contributions to the Study of Mind and Society|access-date=6 April 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2021|sure=y|reason=This is an unpublished undergraduate student assignment paper}}</ref> supported by her family.<ref name=Furumoto>{{cite journal|last1=Furumoto |first1=Laurel |title=Joining separate spheres: Christine Ladd-Franklin, woman-scientist (1847-1930). |journal=American Psychologist |date=1992 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=175–182|doi=10.1037//0003-066x.47.2.175}}</ref>

In the fall of 1866 Ladd enrolled in Vassar College financed by a loan from her aunt, Juliet Niles,<ref name="Ragsdale" /> but left at the end of the spring term due to lack of money.<ref name=Cadwallader/> Ladd then worked as a public school teacher until her aunt's aid allowed her to re-enter Vassar and graduate with an A.B. degree in 1869. While there, Ladd began working under the mentorship of astronomy professor, [[Maria Mitchell]], who was famous for having been "the first woman to discover a new comet, using a telescope, in 1847".<ref name=Vaughn>{{cite web|last1=Vaughn|first1=Kelli|title=Profile of Christine Ladd-Franklin|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/christine-ladd-franklin/|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|access-date=6 April 2015|archive-date=22 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422224438/http://www.feministvoices.com/christine-ladd-franklin|url-status=dead}}</ref> Mitchell was also a [[suffragette]] and strove to inspire women to gain more self-confidence in order to succeed in the male-dominated academia of the time. Under the guidance of Mitchell, Ladd became proficient and developed a love for physics and mathematics.<ref name=Christine>{{cite web|title=Christine Ladd-Franklin|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404708230.html|website=Encyclopedia of World Biography Online|access-date=6 April 2015}}</ref> Since women in nineteenth-century America were not allowed in physics laboratories, Ladd chose to study mathematics.<ref name=Vaughn /> Later in her life, Ladd would reflect on her decision and say, "had it not been for the impossibility, in those days, in the case of women, of obtaining access to laboratory facilities" she would have eagerly gone on to study physics.<ref name=Vaughn />

In 1887 Vassar College awarded Ladd an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]]<ref name="vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu" />

==Early career==
After graduating, Ladd taught science and mathematics at secondary level in [[Washington, Pennsylvania]]; [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania]]; Massachusetts; and New York for nine years,<ref name="vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu" /> although her diary entries indicate that her interest in teaching diminished over time.<ref name="Ragsdale" /> During this time, she contributed seventy-seven mathematical problems and solutions to the ''Educational Times'' of [[London]]. She also published six items in ''The Analyst: A Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics'' and three in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]''.<ref name=Cadwallader/>

==Graduate education==
In 1878, Ladd was accepted into [[Johns Hopkins University]] with the help of [[James Joseph Sylvester|James J. Sylvester]], an English mathematician among the university's faculty who remembered some of Ladd's earlier works in the ''Educational Times''.<ref name=Cadwallader/> Ladd's application for a fellowship was signed "C. Ladd", and the university offered it to her without realizing she was a woman.<ref name=Riddle>{{cite web |last=Riddle |first=Larry |title=Christine Ladd-Franklin |url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/ladd.htm |publisher=Agnes Scott College |access-date=6 November 2012}}</ref> When they did realize this, the board tried to revoke the offer, but Sylvester insisted that Ladd should be his student, and so she was.<ref name=Riddle/> She held a fellowship at Johns Hopkins University for three years, but the trustees did not allow her name to be printed in circulars with those of other fellows, for fear of setting a precedent.<ref name=Riddle/> Furthermore, dissension over her continued presence forced one of the original trustees to resign.<ref name=Riddle/>

Since the university did not approve of coeducation, at first Ladd was only allowed to attend classes taught by Sylvester. However, after displaying exceptional work in his courses, Ladd was allowed to take courses with additional professors. Even though she was awarded a stipend, she was not allowed to have the title of "[[fellow]]".<ref name="Ragsdale" /> During 1879 and 1880, Ladd took classes taught by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who has been called the first American experimental psychologist.<ref name=Cadwallader/>  She wrote a dissertation "On the Algebra of Logic" with Peirce as her thesis advisor. The dissertation was published in ''Studies in Logic'' (C.S. Peirce, ed.) in 1883. In 1884 Ladd attended [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]]'s [[Master class#History|master class]] and met her future husband, [[Fabian Franklin]]. 

Due to her studies with Sylvester and Peirce, Ladd became the first American woman to formally receive graduate instruction in both mathematics and [[symbolic logic]].<ref name="Vaughn" /> Since women were not allowed to graduate from Johns Hopkins University at that time, Ladd was refused a PhD in mathematics and logic, although she was the first woman to complete all the university's requirements for a PhD. The university eventually officially awarded her a PhD during its 50th-anniversary celebrations in 1926<ref name="Lamb-SciAm-2020">{{cite web |last1=Lamb |first1=Evelyn |title=That Time It Took a Student 44 Years to Get Her Degree because She Was a Woman |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/that-time-it-took-a-student-44-years-to-get-her-degree-because-she-was-a-woman/ |website=Scientific American |access-date=6 February 2021}}</ref> (44 years after she had earned it) when she was seventy-eight.<ref name=Cadwallader/>

In 1893 she sought a teaching position at Johns Hopkins University but was denied. Despite this setback, she remained persistent and determined.<ref name="Ragsdale" />  Laurel Furumoto, in his work discussing the sociopolitical environment of the time, notes that Ladd's "inability to secure a regular academic position was a predictable consequence, in that time period, of her decision to marry."<ref name=Furumoto1994>Furumoto, L. (1994). Christine Ladd-Franklin's color theory: Strategy for claiming scientific authority? In. Adler, H.E. & Rieber, R.W. (Eds.) Aspects of the history of psychology in America: 1892-1992 (pp. 91-100). New York: The New York Academy of Sciences.</ref> Eleven years later, in 1904, she was at last given permission to teach one class per year. For the next five years her position at Johns Hopkins University had to be approved and renewed on a yearly basis. Women who were able to obtain academic positions in universities at this time often chose these positions despite their lack of compensation. Ladd was no different. Many of the teaching positions that she held were on a volunteer basis, creating substantial financial strain on her and her family. Yet, it is evident that Ladd placed a high value on her ability to earn the academic affiliations necessary to become a successful contributor to her field.<ref name="Ragsdale" />

==Personal life and philosophy==
After marriage to [[Fabian Franklin]] on August 24, 1882,<ref name="Ragsdale" /> she adopted the name Christine Ladd-Franklin. The couple had two children, one of whom died in infancy. The other, Margaret Ladd-Franklin, became a prominent member in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].<ref name=Cadwallader/> Ladd-Franklin often wrote of the injustice she observed in the oppression of the female sex. In one such journal entry while at Vassar College she describes her disappointment with the views in society about and among women, stating, "I so despise the idea that woman are not as competent to take care of themselves as men, that they cannot decide for themselves when to go to bed and when to get up, how much exercise to take, how much to pray and go to church. Still my greatest objection is to the class of girls who come here and to the social and political atmosphere of the place&nbsp;... I know of but one girl who declares herself for the rights of women" (September 22, 1866).<ref name="vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu">{{Cite web | url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/christine-ladd-franklin.html |title = Christine Ladd-Franklin - Vassar College Encyclopedia - Vassar College}}</ref> In another journal entry she writes about the lack of recognition of women who have earned advanced educational degrees, "That is the case with our clever girls -- they go to Germany and get the parchments, beautifully signed and sealed, that proclaim them to be doctors of philosophy, but no further consequences follow. They have nothing but the empty satisfaction of exhibiting their 'tickets{{'"}}.<ref name="vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu"/>

She died on March 5, 1930 in New York, New York.<ref name=Cadwallader/>

==Major contributions and achievements==
After leaving Hopkins, Ladd-Franklin worked with German psychologist [[Georg Elias Müller|G. E. Müller]], where she carried out experimental work on vision. Although women in academic settings and laboratories were viewed as equally unwelcome as in the United States, she managed to secure a position.<ref name="vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu"/> Ladd-Franklin was also able to work in the laboratory of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], where she attended his lectures on theory of color vision. After attending these lectures, Ladd-Franklin developed her own theory of color vision.<ref name=Cadwallader/> In 1929 she published ''Color and Color Theories''.

===Ladd-Franklin's theory of color vision===
One of the major contributions that Ladd-Franklin made to psychology was her theory of color vision, which was based on evolution. Ladd-Franklin noted that: "some animals are color blind and assumed that achromatic vision appeared first in evolution and color vision came later." She assumed further that the human eye carries fragments of its earlier evolutionary development. She observed that the most highly evolved part of the eye is the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]], where, at least in daylight, visual acuity and color sensitivity are greatest. Ladd-Franklin assumed that peripheral vision (provided by the [[Rod cell|rods]] of the [[retina]]) was more primitive than foveal vision (provided by the cones of the retina) because night vision and movement detection are crucial for survival."<ref name=Hergenhahn>{{cite book|last=Hergenhahn|first=B.R.|title=An introduction to the history of psychology|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=9780495506218|edition=6th|pages=243&ndash;244 }}</ref>

===Stages of color vision===
Ladd-Franklin concluded that color vision evolved in three stages: achromatic vision (black and white), blue-yellow sensitivity and red-green sensitivity.<ref name=Hergenhahn/> Since red-green sensitivity was the last to evolve it explains why many people suffer from [[Color_blindness#Red–green_color_blindness|red-green color blindness]]. The next one that affects a small population is [[Color_blindness#Blue–yellow_color_blindness|blue-yellow color blindness]]. Since achromatic vision was the first to evolve it explains why the majority of the population are not affected by [[Monochromacy|black-white color blindness]].<ref name=Hergenhahn/>

===Mathematics and logic===
Ladd-Franklin was the first woman to have a published paper in the ''Analyst''. She was also the first woman to receive a PhD in mathematics and logic.<ref name = cLaddFranklin1881 >Peirce's Ph.D. student Christine Ladd-Franklin found the truth table in ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' Proposition 5.101, 40 years earlier than Wittgenstein. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A48XAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA62 Christine Ladd (1881), "On the Algebra of Logic", p.62], ''Studies in Logic'', C. S. Peirce ed., 1883</ref> The majority of her publications were based on visual processes and logic. Her views on logic influenced Charles S. Peirce's logic and she was highly praised by [[Arthur Prior]].<ref name=Cadwallader/>

===Professional involvement===
Ladd-Franklin was among the first women to be inducted into the [[American Psychological Association]] in December 1893. From 1894 to 1925, Ladd-Franklin presented ten papers at APA meetings.<ref name=Cadwallader/> She was also one of the first female members of the [[Optical Society of America]] in 1919. During their meetings she presented six papers and two exhibits.<ref name=Cadwallader/> Ladd-Franklin was included in the ''[[Who's Who in America]]'' during 1901-1902 and 1914-1915. Ladd-Franklin remained a member of both scientific societies until her death.<ref name=Cadwallader/> She was also a prominent member of the women's rights movement.

In 1948, [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote: "I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. Christine Ladd-Franklin, saying that she was a [[solipsist]], and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician and a solipsist, her surprise surprised me."<ref>Russell, B. (1948). Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits. New York: Simon and Schuster. p. 180.</ref>
