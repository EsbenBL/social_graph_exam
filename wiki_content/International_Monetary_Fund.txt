The '''International Monetary Fund''' ('''IMF''') is an international financial institution, headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], consisting of 190 countries "working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce [[poverty]] around the world."<ref name="about">{{cite web |url= https://www.imf.org/external/about.htm|title=About the IMF| website= IMF.org |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> Formed in 1944, started on 27 December 1945,<ref name="IMF-at-a-Glance" /> at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] primarily by the ideas of [[Harry Dexter White]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]],<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2002/wp0252.pdf |title=Why White, Not Keynes?

Quotas, which are pooled funds of member nations, generate most IMF funds. The size of a member's quota depends on its economic and financial importance in the world. Nations with greater economic significance have larger quotas. The quotas are increased periodically as a means of boosting the IMF's resources in the form of [[special drawing rights]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/07/14/12/21/IMF-Quotas |title= IMF Quotas |website= IMF.org |language=en|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>

==Functions==
[[File:Board of Governors International Monetary Fund.jpg|thumb|Board of Governors International Monetary Fund (1999)]]
According to the IMF itself, it works to foster global growth and [[economic stability]] by providing policy advice and financing the members by working with [[developing country|developing countries]] to help them achieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the IMF|url=http://www.imf.org/external/about.htm|publisher=International Monetary Fund|access-date=12 March 2012}}</ref> The rationale for this is that private international capital markets function imperfectly and many countries have limited access to financial markets. Such market imperfections, together with balance-of-payments financing, provide the justification for official financing, without which many countries could only correct large external payment imbalances through measures with adverse economic consequences.<ref name="What's Wrong">{{cite book|last1=Isard|first1=Peter|title=Globalization and the International Financial System: What's Wrong and What Can be Done|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}</ref> The IMF provides alternate sources of financing such as the [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Upon the founding of the IMF, its three primary functions were: to oversee the [[fixed exchange rate system|fixed exchange rate]] arrangements between countries,<ref name="Jensen 2004, April, Issue 48">{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Nathan|title=Crisis, Conditions, and Capital: The Effect of the IMF on Direct Foreign Investment|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|date=April 2004|issue=2 |doi=10.1177/0022002703262860 |volume=48|pages=194–210|s2cid=154419320}}</ref> thus helping national governments manage their [[exchange rate]]s and allowing these governments to prioritize economic growth,<ref name="chorev">{{cite journal|last1=Chorev|first1=Nistan|author2=Sarah Babb|title=The crisis of neoliberalism and the future of international institutions: a comparison of the IMF and the WTO|journal=Theory and Society |doi=10.1007/s11186-009-9093-5|volume=38|issue=5|pages=459–484|date=2009|s2cid=55564202}}</ref> and to provide short-term capital to aid the [[balance of payments]].<ref name="Jensen 2004, April, Issue 48" /> This assistance was meant to prevent the spread of international [[financial crisis|economic crises]]. The IMF was also intended to help mend the pieces of the international economy after the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]<ref name="chorev"/>{{failed verification|date=July 2021|reason=part of Bretton Woods doesn't mean it ''is'' Bretton Woods}} as well as to provide capital investments for economic growth and projects such as [[infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

The IMF's role was fundamentally altered by the [[floating exchange rate]]s post-1971. It shifted to examining the economic policies of countries with IMF loan agreements to determine if a shortage of capital was due to [[business cycle|economic fluctuations]] or economic policy. The IMF also researched what types of government policy would ensure economic recovery.<ref name="Jensen 2004, April, Issue 48"/> A particular concern of the IMF was to prevent financial crises such as those in [[Mexico]] in 1982, [[Brazil]] in 1987, [[East Asia]] in [[Asian financial crisis|1997–98]], and [[Russia]] in [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998]], from spreading and threatening the entire global financial and currency system. The challenge was to promote and implement a policy that reduced the frequency of crises among the emerging market countries, especially the middle-income countries which are vulnerable to massive capital outflows.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Stanley|title=Financial Crises and Reform of the International Financial System|journal=Review of World Economics|volume=139|pages=1–37|date=March 2003 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w9297.pdf|doi=10.1007/BF02659606}}</ref> Rather than maintaining a position of oversight of only exchange rates, their function became one of surveillance of the overall macroeconomic performance of member countries. Their role became a lot more active because the IMF now manages economic policy rather than just exchange rates.

In addition, the IMF negotiates conditions on lending and loans under their policy of [[conditionality]],<ref name="Jensen 2004, April, Issue 48" /> which was established in the 1950s.<ref name="chorev" /> [[developing country|Low-income countries]] can borrow on [[Loan#Concessional|concessional terms]], which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Non-concessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through the [[IMF Stand-By Arrangement|Stand-By Arrangements]] (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Factsheet: IMF Lending |url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/howlend.htm|work=About the IMF|publisher=International Monetary Fund|access-date=8 April 2012}}</ref>

===Surveillance of the global economy===
The IMF is mandated to oversee the international monetary and financial system and monitor the economic and financial policies of its member countries.<ref name="IMF Surveillance: A Case Study on IMF Governance">{{cite web|last1=Bossone|first1=Biagio|title=IMF Surveillance: A Case Study on IMF Governance|url=http://www.ieo-imf.org/ieo/files/completedevaluations/05212008BP08_10.pdf |publisher=Independent Office of the International Monetary Fund}}</ref> This activity is known as surveillance and facilitates international co-operation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Factsheet: IMF Surveillance|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/surv.htm |work=About the IMF|publisher=International Monetary Fund}}</ref> Since the demise of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s, surveillance has evolved largely by way of changes in procedures rather than through the adoption of new obligations.<ref name="IMF Surveillance: A Case Study on IMF Governance"/> The responsibilities changed from those of guardians to those of overseers of members' policies.

The Fund typically analyses the appropriateness of each member country's economic and financial policies for achieving orderly economic growth, and assesses the consequences of these policies for other countries and for the [[global economy]].<ref name="IMF Surveillance: A Case Study on IMF Governance" /> The maximum sustainable debt level of a polity, which is watched closely by the IMF, was defined in 2011 by IMF economists to be 120%.<ref name="imfmsd">{{cite journal |author1=Fiscal Affairs Department |author2=Strategy, Policy, and Review Department |editor1-last=Cottarelli |editor1-first=Carlo |editor2-last=Moghadam |editor2-first=Reza |title=Modernizing the Framework for Fiscal Policy and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis |journal=International Monetary Fund |date=5 August 2011 |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2011/080511.pdf}}</ref> Indeed, it was at this number that the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek economy melted down]] in 2010.<ref name="acii10">{{cite news |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Anis |last2=Islam |first2=Iyanatul |title=Is there an optimal debt-to-GDP ratio? |url=https://voxeu.org/debates/commentaries/there-optimal-debt-gdp-ratio |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=9 November 2010}}</ref>

In 1995 the International Monetary Fund began to work on data dissemination standards with the view of guiding IMF member countries to disseminate their economic and financial data to the public. The International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) endorsed the guidelines for the dissemination standards and they were split into two tiers: [[The General Data Dissemination System]] (GDDS) and the [[Special Data Dissemination Standard]] (SDDS).

The executive board approved the SDDS and GDDS in 1996 and 1997 respectively, and subsequent amendments were published in a revised ''Guide to the General Data Dissemination System''. The system is aimed primarily at statisticians and aims to improve many aspects of statistical systems in a country. It is also part of the [[World Bank]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] and Poverty Reduction Strategic Papers.

The primary objective of the GDDS is to encourage member countries to build a framework to improve data quality and statistical capacity building to evaluate statistical needs, set priorities in improving the timeliness, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]], reliability, and accessibility of financial and economic data. Some countries initially used the GDDS, but later upgraded to SDDS.

Some entities that are not themselves IMF members also contribute statistical data to the systems:
* [[Palestinian Authority]] – GDDS
* [[Hong Kong]] – SDDS
* [[Macau]] – GDDS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2007/pr07179.htm|title=Press Release: Macao SAR Begins Participation in the IMF's General Data Dissemination System}}</ref>
* Institutions of the [[European Union]]:
** the [[European Central Bank]] for the [[Eurozone]] – SDDS
** [[Eurostat]] for the whole EU – SDDS, thus providing data from Cyprus (not using any DDSystem on its own) and Malta (using only GDDS on its own)

===Conditionality of loans===
IMF conditionality is a set of policies or conditions that the IMF requires in exchange for financial resources.<ref name="Jensen 2004, April, Issue 48" /> The IMF does require [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] from countries for loans but also requires the government seeking assistance to correct its macroeconomic imbalances in the form of policy reform.<ref name="guimaraes">{{cite journal|last1=Guimaraes|first1=Bernardo|author2=Iazdi, Oz|title=IMF conditionalities, liquidity provision, and incentives for fiscal adjustment|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|doi=10.1007/s10797-014-9329-9|volume=22|issue=5|pages=705–722|date=2015|title-link=Funding liquidity|s2cid=56183488}}</ref> If the conditions are not met, the funds are withheld.<ref name="Jensen 2004, April, Issue 48" /><ref name="An Analysis of IMF Conditionality">{{cite journal|last1=Buira|first1=Ariel|title=An Analysis of IMF Conditionality|journal=G-24 Discussion Papers|date =August 2003|series=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|issue=22}}</ref> The concept of conditionality was introduced in a 1952 executive board decision and later incorporated into the Articles of Agreement.

Conditionality is associated with economic theory as well as an enforcement mechanism for repayment. Stemming primarily from the work of [[Jacques J. Polak|Jacques Polak]], the theoretical underpinning of conditionality was the "monetary approach to the balance of payments".<ref name="chorev"/>

====Structural adjustment====
{{Further|Structural adjustment}}

Some of the conditions for structural adjustment can include:
* Cutting expenditures or raising revenues, also known as [[austerity]].
* Focusing economic output on direct export and [[resource extraction]],
* [[Devaluation]] of currencies,
* [[Trade liberalisation]], or lifting import and export restrictions,
* Increasing the stability of investment (by supplementing [[foreign direct investment]] with the opening of domestic [[stock market]]s),
* [[Balanced budget|Balancing budgets]] and not overspending,
* Removing [[price control]]s and state [[subsidy|subsidies]],
* [[Privatization]], or [[divestiture]] of all or part of state-owned enterprises,
* Enhancing the rights of [[foreign investors]] vis-a-vis national laws,
* Improving [[governance]] and fighting corruption.

These conditions are known as the [[Washington Consensus]].

====Benefits====
These loan conditions ensure that the borrowing country will be able to repay the IMF and that the country will not attempt to solve their balance-of-payment problems in a way that would negatively impact the [[international economy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Factsheet: IMF Conditionality|url=http://www.imf.org/eternal/np/exr/facts/conditio.htm|work=About the IMF|publisher=International Monetary Fund|access-date=18 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="IMF Conditionality and Country Ownership of Programs">{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=Mohsin S.|author2=Sunil Sharm|title=IMF Conditionality and Country Ownership of Programs|journal=IMF Institute|date=24 September 2001|url=http://www.icrier.org/pdf/harma.pdf}}</ref> The incentive problem of [[moral hazard]]—when [[economic agents]] maximise their own [[utility]] to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than providing collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess internationally valuable collateral anyway.<ref name="IMF Conditionality and Country Ownership of Programs" />

Conditionality also reassures the IMF that the funds lent to them will be used for the purposes defined by the Articles of Agreement and provides safeguards that country will be able to rectify its macroeconomic and structural imbalances.<ref name="IMF Conditionality and Country Ownership of Programs" /> In the judgment of the IMF, the adoption by the member of certain corrective measures or policies will allow it to repay the IMF, thereby ensuring that the resources will be available to support other members.<ref name="An Analysis of IMF Conditionality" />

{{As of|2004}}, borrowing countries have had a good track record for repaying credit extended under the IMF's regular lending facilities with full interest over the duration of the loan. This indicates that IMF lending does not impose a burden on creditor countries, as lending countries receive market-rate interest on most of their quota subscription, plus any of their own-currency subscriptions that are loaned out by the IMF, plus all of the reserve assets that they provide the IMF.<ref name="What's Wrong" />

[[File:Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.jpg|thumb|First page of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, 1 March 1946. Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs archives]]

The IMF was originally laid out as a part of the [[Bretton Woods system]] exchange agreement in 1944.<ref name="Jensen, pp 194-210">{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Nathan|title=Crisis, Conditions, and Capital: The Effect of the International Monetary Fund on Foreign Direct Investment |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=2004|pages=194–210|doi=10.1177/0022002703262860|volume=48|issue=2|s2cid=154419320}}</ref> During the [[Great Depression]], countries sharply raised barriers to trade in an attempt to improve their failing economies. This led to the [[devaluation]] of national currencies and a decline in world trade.<ref Name=CoopAndRecon>{{cite web|title=Cooperation and Reconstruction (1944–71)|url=http://www.imf.org/external/about/histcoop.htm|work=About the IMF|access-date=18 March 2012}}</ref>

This breakdown in international monetary cooperation created a need for oversight. The representatives of 45 governments met at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] in the Mount Washington Hotel in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], in the United States, to discuss a framework for postwar international economic cooperation and how to rebuild Europe.

There were two views on the role the IMF should assume as a global economic institution. American delegate [[Harry Dexter White]] foresaw an IMF that functioned more like a bank, making sure that borrowing states could repay their debts on time.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal|title=IMF History and Structural Adjustment Conditions|journal=UC Atlas of Global Inequality|series=Economic Crises|url=http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/sap/history.php|access-date=18 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422104204/http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/sap/history.php|archive-date=22 April 2012}}</ref> Most of White's plan was incorporated into the final acts adopted at Bretton Woods. British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], on the other hand, imagined that the IMF would be a cooperative fund upon which member states could draw to maintain economic activity and employment through periodic crises. This view suggested an IMF that helped governments and to act as the United States government had during the New Deal to the great recession of the 1930s.<ref name="auto"/>

The IMF formally came into existence on 27 December 1945, when the first 29 countries [[ratified]] its Articles of Agreement.<ref>{{cite book|page=79|url={{Google books|alysnLedf5oC|page=PA79|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=International Financial Management|isbn=978-93-81141-07-6|last1=Somanath|first1=V.S.|year=2011}}</ref> By the end of 1946 the IMF had grown to 39 members.<ref name=Vries86>{{cite book|pages=66–68|url={{Google books|ckFzL3xr8kAC|page=PA66|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=The IMF in a Changing World: 1945–85|isbn=978-1-4552-8096-4|last1=De Vries|first1=Margaret G|year=1986}}</ref> On 1 March 1947, the IMF began its financial operations,<ref>{{cite book|page=269|url={{Google books|NLGFgoJ0qHUC|page=PA269|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=Growth of the International Economy 1820–2000: An Introductory Text|isbn=978-0-203-19935-0|last1=Kenwood|first1=George|last2=Lougheed|first2=Alan|date=2002}}</ref> and on 8 May France became the first country to borrow from it.<ref name=Vries86/>

The IMF was one of the key organizations of the international economic system; its design allowed the system to balance the rebuilding of international capitalism with the maximization of national economic sovereignty and human welfare, also known as [[embedded liberalism]].<ref name="chorev"/> The IMF's influence in the global economy steadily increased as it accumulated more members. The increase reflected, in particular, the attainment of political independence by many African countries and more recently the 1991 [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] because most countries in the Soviet sphere of influence did not join the IMF.<ref Name=CoopAndRecon />

The Bretton Woods exchange rate system prevailed until 1971 when the United States government suspended the convertibility of the US$ (and dollar reserves held by other governments) into gold. This is known as the [[Nixon Shock]].<ref Name=CoopAndRecon /> The changes to the IMF articles of agreement reflecting these changes were ratified in 1976 by the [[Jamaica Accords]]. Later in the 1970s, large commercial banks began lending to states because they were awash in cash deposited by oil exporters. The lending of the so-called money center banks led to the IMF changing its role in the 1980s after a world recession provoked a crisis that brought the IMF back into global financial governance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International monetary cooperation since Bretton Woods|last1=James |first1=Harold|date=1996|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=9781455293070|oclc=955641912}}</ref>

===21st century===

In May 2010, the IMF participated, in 3:11 proportion, in the [[Greek government-debt crisis#Rescue packages provided by the EU and IMF|first Greek bailout]] that totaled €110 billion, to address the great accumulation of public debt, caused by continuing large public sector deficits.

In the October 2013 '''Fiscal Monitor''' publication, the IMF suggested that a [[capital levy]] capable of reducing Euro-area government debt ratios to "end-2007 levels" would require a very high tax rate of about 10%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fm/2013/02/pdf/fm1302.pdf|title=Fiscal Monitor: "Taxing Times" Oct 2013, p. 49}}</ref>

The '''Fiscal Affairs''' department of the IMF, headed at the time by Acting Director Sanjeev Gupta, produced a January 2014 report entitled "Fiscal Policy and Income Inequality" that stated that "Some taxes levied on wealth, especially on immovable property, are also an option for economies seeking more [[progressive taxation]] ... Property taxes are equitable and efficient, but underutilized in many economies ... There is considerable scope to exploit this tax more fully, both as a revenue source and as a redistributive instrument."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2014/012314.pdf|title=IMF: "Fiscal Affairs and Income Inequality" 23 Jan 2014}}</ref>

===Qualifications===
Any country may apply to be a part of the IMF. Post-IMF formation, in the early postwar period, rules for IMF membership were left relatively loose. Members needed to make periodic membership payments towards their quota, to refrain from currency restrictions unless granted IMF permission, to abide by the Code of Conduct in the IMF Articles of Agreement, and to provide national economic information. However, stricter rules were imposed on governments that applied to the IMF for funding.<ref name="chorev"/>

The countries that joined the IMF between 1945 and 1971 agreed to keep their exchange rates secured at rates that could be adjusted only to correct a "fundamental disequilibrium" in the balance of payments, and only with the IMF's agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=What is the IMF?|newspaper=Telegraph|date=12 April 2011|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8443610/What-is-the-IMF.html}}</ref>

===Benefits===
Member countries of the IMF have access to information on the economic policies of all member countries, the opportunity to influence other members' economic policies, [[technical assistance]] in banking, fiscal affairs, and exchange matters, financial support in times of payment difficulties, and increased opportunities for trade and investment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obligations and Benefits of IMF Membership|work=Money Matters: An IMF Exhibit – The Importance of Global Cooperation|publisher=International Monetary Fund|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/center/mm/eng/mm_bnfts.htm|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>

===Board of Governors===
The Board of Governors consists of one governor and one alternate governor for each member country. Each member country appoints its two governors. The Board normally meets once a year and is responsible for electing or appointing an executive director to the executive board. While the Board of Governors is officially responsible for approving quota increases, [[special drawing rights|special drawing right]] allocations, the admittance of new members, compulsory withdrawal of members, and amendments to the Articles of Agreement and By-Laws, in practice it has delegated most of its powers to the IMF's executive board.<ref name="Governance Structure">{{cite web|title=Governance Structure|url=http://www.imf.org/external/about/govstruct.htm|work=About the IMF: Governance|access-date=18 March 2012}}</ref>

The Board of Governors is advised by the [[International Monetary and Financial Committee]] and the Development Committee. The International Monetary and Financial Committee has 24 members and monitors developments in global liquidity and the transfer of resources to [[developing country|developing countries]].<ref name="IMF Factsheet: Guide to Committees, Groups, and Clubs">{{cite web|title=Factsheet: Guide to Committees, Groups, and Clubs|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/groups.htm|work=About the IMF|publisher=International Monetary Fund}}</ref> The Development Committee has 25 members and advises on critical development issues and on financial resources required to promote economic development in developing countries. They also advise on trade and [[environmental issues]].

The Board of Governors reports directly to the managing director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva.<ref name="IMF Factsheet: Guide to Committees, Groups, and Clubs" />

===Executive Board===
24 Executive Directors make up the executive board. The executive directors represent all 189 member countries in a geographically based roster.<ref name=edsa/> Countries with large economies have their own executive director, but most countries are grouped in constituencies representing four or more countries.<ref name="Governance Structure"/>

Following the ''2008 Amendment on Voice and Participation'' which came into effect in March 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2011/pr1164.htm|title=Press Release: The IMF's 2008 Quota and Voice Reforms Take Effect}}</ref> seven countries each appoint an executive director: the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia.<ref name=edsa>{{cite web|title=IMF Executive Directors and Voting Power|work=Member Quotas Shares, Governors, and Voting Power|publisher=International Monetary Fund|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/eds.aspx}}</ref> The remaining 17 Directors represent constituencies consisting of 2 to 23 countries.

==Voting power==
Voting power in the IMF is based on a quota system. Each member has a number of '''basic votes''' (each member's number of basic votes equals 5.502% of the '''total votes'''),<ref>{{cite web|title=Membership|url=http://www.imf.org/external/about/members.htm#function|work=About the IMF|publisher=International Monetary Fund|access-date=18 March 2012}}</ref> plus one additional vote for each special drawing right (SDR) of 100,000 of a member country's quota.<ref name = "Political Economy of IMF voting">{{Harvnb|Blomberg|Broz|2006}}.</ref> The [[special drawing rights|special drawing right]] is the unit of account of the IMF and represents a potential claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias.<ref name="Political Economy of IMF voting" /> Changes in the voting shares require approval by a super-majority of 85% of voting power.<ref name="Lipscy 2015" />

In December 2015, the United States Congress adopted a legislation authorising the 2010 Quota and Governance Reforms. As a result,
* all 190 members' quotas will increase from a total of about XDR 238.5 billion to about XDR 477 billion, while the quota shares and voting power of the IMF's poorest member countries will be protected.
* more than 6 percent of quota shares will shift to dynamic emerging market and developing countries and also from over-represented to under-represented members.
* four emerging market countries (Brazil, China, India, and Russia) will be among the ten largest members of the IMF. Other top 10 members are the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy.<ref>IMF [http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15573.htm IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde Welcomes U.S. Congressional Approval of the 2010 Quota and Governance Reforms], Press release No. 15/573, 18 December 2015.</ref>

===Effects of the quota system===
The IMF's quota system was created to raise funds for loans.<ref name="chorev"/> Each IMF member country is assigned a quota, or contribution, that reflects the country's relative size in the global economy. Each member's quota also determines its relative voting power. Thus, financial contributions from member governments are linked to voting power in the organization.<ref name="Political Economy of IMF voting" />

This system follows the logic of a shareholder-controlled organization: wealthy countries have more say in the making and revision of rules.<ref name="chorev"/> Since decision making at the IMF reflects each member's relative economic position in the world, wealthier countries that provide more money to the IMF have more influence than poorer members that contribute less; nonetheless, the IMF focuses on redistribution.<ref name="Political Economy of IMF voting" />

===Inflexibility of voting power===
Quotas are normally reviewed every five years and can be increased when deemed necessary by the Board of Governors. IMF voting shares are relatively inflexible: countries that grow economically have tended to become under-represented as their voting power lags behind.<ref name="Lipscy 2015" /> Currently, reforming the representation of [[developing countries]] within the IMF has been suggested.<ref name="Political Economy of IMF voting" /> These countries' economies represent a large portion of the global economic system but this is not reflected in the IMF's decision making process through the nature of the quota system. [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues, "There is a need to provide more effective voice and representation for developing countries, which now represent a much larger portion of world economic activity since 1944, when the IMF was created."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stiglitz and Members of a UN Commission on Financial Experts|first1=Joseph E.|title=The Stiglitz Report: Reforming the International Monetary and Financial Systems in the Wake of the Global Crisis|year=2010|publisher=The New Press|location=New York}}</ref> In 2008, a number of quota reforms were passed including shifting 6% of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Factsheet: IMF Quotas|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/quotas.htm|work=About the IMF|publisher=The International Monetary Fund}}</ref>

===Overcoming borrower/creditor divide===
The IMF's membership is divided along income lines: certain countries provide financial resources while others use these resources. Both [[developed country]] "creditors" and [[developing country]] "borrowers" are members of the IMF. The developed countries provide the financial resources but rarely enter into IMF loan agreements; they are the creditors. Conversely, the developing countries use the lending services but contribute little to the pool of money available to lend because their quotas are smaller; they are the borrowers. Thus, tension is created around governance issues because these two groups, creditors and borrowers, have fundamentally different interests.<ref name="Political Economy of IMF voting" />

The criticism is that the system of voting power distribution through a quota system institutionalizes borrower subordination and creditor dominance. The resulting division of the IMF's membership into borrowers and non-borrowers has increased the controversy around conditionality because the borrowers are interested in increasing loan access while creditors want to maintain reassurance that the loans will be repaid.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kafka|first1=Alejandre|title=Some IMF Problems after the Committee of Twenty|work=International Financial Policy: Essays in honour of Jaques J. Polack|url=https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF071/03699-9781557751966/03699-9781557751966/ch05.xml|url-access=subscription|access-date=2 December 2018|date=September 1991}}</ref>

A recent{{when|date=July 2015}} source revealed that the average overall use of IMF credit per decade increased, in real terms, by 21% between the 1970s and 1980s, and increased again by just over 22% from the 1980s to the 1991–2005 period. Another study has suggested that since 1950 the continent of Africa alone has received $300&nbsp;billion from the IMF, the World Bank, and affiliate institutions.<ref name="MukherjeeIEOED">{{cite journal|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Bumba|title=International Economic Organizations and Economic Development|journal=SAIS Review of International Affairs|year=2008|volume=28|issue=2|pages=123–137|doi=10.1353/sais.0.0013|s2cid=154755471}}</ref>

A study by Bumba Mukherjee found that developing [[Democracy|democratic countries]] benefit more from IMF programs than developing [[Autocracy|autocratic countries]] because policy-making, and the process of deciding where loaned money is used, is more transparent within a democracy.<ref Name= "MukherjeeIEOED" /> One study done by [[Randall Stone]] found that although earlier studies found little impact of IMF programs on balance of payments, more recent studies using more sophisticated methods and larger samples "usually found IMF programs improved the balance of payments".<ref name="Jensen, pp 194-210"/>

===Exceptional Access Framework – sovereign debt===
The Exceptional Access Framework was created in 2003 when [[John B. Taylor]] was Under Secretary of the [[US Treasury]] for International Affairs. The new Framework became fully operational in February 2003 and it was applied in the subsequent decisions on Argentina and Brazil.<ref>[https://www.imf.org/external/np/acc/2004/eng/032304.pdf inf.org: "International Monetary Fund – Review of Exceptional Access Policy"], 23 March 2004</ref> Its purpose was to place some sensible rules and limits on the way the IMF makes loans to support governments with debt problem—especially in emerging markets—and thereby move away from the bailout mentality of the 1990s. Such a reform was essential for ending the crisis atmosphere that then existed in emerging markets. The reform was closely related to and put in place nearly simultaneously with the actions of several emerging market countries to place [[collective action clause]]s in their bond contracts.

In 2010, the framework was abandoned so the IMF could make loans to Greece in an unsustainable and political situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economicsone.com/2014/03/25/why-the-imfs-exceptional-access-framework-is-so-important/|title=Why the IMF's Exceptional Access Framework is So Important|first1=John|last1=Taylor|date=26 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=taywsj>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303519404579352883092156074|title=WSJ|via=online.wsj.com}}</ref>

The topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by IMF staff in April 2013 for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled "Sovereign Debt Restructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund's Legal and Policy Framework".<ref name="imf.org"/> The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> summarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize and Jamaica. An explanatory interview with Deputy Director Hugh Bredenkamp was published a few days later,<ref name="ReferenceB"/> as was a deconstruction by Matina Stevis of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/>

The staff was directed to formulate an updated policy, which was accomplished on 22 May 2014 with a report entitled "The Fund's Lending Framework and Sovereign Debt: Preliminary Considerations", and taken up by the executive board on 13 June.<ref name=efj>[http://armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/THE-FUNDS-LENDING-FRAMEWORK-AND-SOVEREIGN-June-2014.pdf "The Fund's Lending Framework and Sovereign Debt – Preliminary Considerations" 22 May 2014] (also bears date June 2014; team of 20 led by [[Reza Bakir]] and supervised by [[Olivier Blanchard]], [[Sean Hagan]], [[Hugh Bredenkamp]], and [[Peter Dattels]])</ref> The staff proposed that "in circumstances where a (Sovereign) member has lost market access and debt is considered sustainable ... the IMF would be able to provide Exceptional Access on the basis of a debt operation that involves an extension of maturities", which was labeled a "reprofiling operation". These reprofiling operations would "generally be less costly to the debtor and creditors—and thus to the system overall—relative to either an upfront debt reduction operation or a bail-out that is followed by debt reduction ... (and) would be envisaged only when both (a) a member has lost market access and (b) debt is assessed to be sustainable, but not with high probability ... Creditors will only agree if they understand that such an amendment is necessary to avoid a worse outcome: namely, a default and/or an operation involving debt reduction ... [[Collective action clause]]s, which now exist in most—but not all—bonds would be relied upon to address collective action problems."<ref name=efj/>

==Impact==
According to a 2002 study by [[Randall Stone|Randall W. Stone]], the academic literature on the IMF shows "no consensus on the long-term effects of IMF programs on growth.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Randall W.|title=Lending Credibility: The International Monetary Fund and the Post-Communist Transition|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09529-5|pages=43|jstor=j.ctt7t6hn}}</ref>

Some research has found that IMF loans can reduce the chance of a future banking crisis,<ref>Papi, Luca, Andrea F. Presbitero, and Alberto Zazzaro. "IMF lending and banking crises."

Some research has found that IMF programs are less effective in countries which possess a developed-country patron (be it by foreign aid, membership of postcolonial institutions or UN voting patterns), seemingly due to this patron allowing countries to flaunt IMF program rules as these rules are not consistently enforced.<ref>Stone, Randall W.

==Criticisms==
[[File:IMF demonstration (10).png|thumb|[[Anarchist]] protest against the IMF and corporate bailout]]
[[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) research undertaken in 1980 included criticisms of the IMF which support the analysis that it is a pillar of what activist Titus Alexander calls [[global apartheid]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Titus|title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: an overview of world politics|year=1996|publisher=Polity press|pages=133}}</ref>
* Developed countries were seen to have a more dominant role and control over [[Developing country|less developed countries]] (LDCs).
* The Fund worked on the incorrect assumption that all payments [[disequilibria]] were caused domestically. The [[Group of 24]] (G-24), on behalf of LDC members, and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) complained that the IMF did not distinguish sufficiently between disequilibria with predominantly external as opposed to internal causes. This criticism was voiced in the aftermath of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Then LDCs found themselves with payment deficits due to adverse changes in their [[terms of trade]], with the Fund prescribing stabilization programmes similar to those suggested for deficits caused by government over-spending. Faced with long-term, externally generated disequilibria, the G-24 argued for more time for LDCs to adjust their economies.
* Some IMF policies may be anti-developmental; the report said that [[deflationary]] effects of IMF programmes quickly led to losses of output and employment in economies where incomes were low and unemployment was high. Moreover, the burden of the deflation is disproportionately borne by the poor.
* The IMF's initial policies were based in theory and influenced by differing opinions and departmental rivalries. Critics suggest that its intentions to implement these policies in countries with widely varying economic circumstances were misinformed and lacked economic rationale.

ODI conclusions were that the IMF's very nature of promoting market-oriented approaches attracted unavoidable criticism. On the other hand, the IMF could serve as a scapegoat while allowing governments to blame international bankers. The ODI conceded that the IMF was insensitive to political aspirations of LDCs while its policy conditions were inflexible.<ref>{{cite web|title=The IMF and the Third World |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5379&title=imf-ldcs |work=ODI briefing paper |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |access-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107124156/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5379&title=imf-ldcs |archive-date=7 January 2012 }}</ref>

Countries such as [[Zambia]] have not received proper aid with long-lasting effects, leading to concern from economists. Since 2005, Zambia (as well as 29 other African countries) did receive debt write-offs, which helped with the country's medical and education funds. However, Zambia returned to a debt of over half its GDP in less than a decade. American economist [[William Easterly]], sceptical of the IMF's methods, had initially warned that "debt relief would simply encourage more reckless borrowing by crooked governments unless it was accompanied by reforms to speed up economic growth and improve governance," according to ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/15/zambias-looming-debt-crisis-is-a-warning-for-the-rest-of-africa|title=Zambia's looming debt crisis is a warning for the rest of Africa|work=The Economist|access-date=19 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>

===Conditionality===
The IMF has been criticised for being "out of touch" with local economic conditions, cultures, and environments in the countries they are requiring policy reform.<ref name="Jensen 2004, April, Issue 48" /> The economic advice the IMF gives might not always take into consideration the difference between what spending means on paper and how it is felt by citizens.<ref name="The End of Poverty">{{cite book|last1=Sachs|first1=Jeffrey|title=The End of Poverty|url=https://archive.org/details/endofpovertyecon00sach|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=New York}}</ref> Countries charge that with excessive conditionality, they do not "own" the programs and the links are broken between a recipient country's people, its government, and the goals being pursued by the IMF.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Boughton|first1=James M.|chapter=Whose programme is it?

[[Jeffrey Sachs]] argues that the IMF's "usual prescription is 'budgetary belt tightening to countries who are much too poor to own belts{{' "}}.<ref name="The End of Poverty" /> Sachs wrote that the IMF's role as a generalist institution specialising in macroeconomic issues needs reform. [[Conditionality]] has also been criticised because a country can pledge collateral of "acceptable assets" to obtain waivers—if one assumes that all countries are able to provide "acceptable collateral".<ref name="IMF Conditionality and Country Ownership of Programs" />

One view is that conditionality undermines domestic political institutions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stiglitz|first1=Joseph E.|title=Making Globalization Work|year=2006|publisher=Allen Lane: an imprint of the Penguin Group|location=Great Britain}}</ref> The recipient governments are sacrificing policy autonomy in exchange for funds, which can lead to public resentment of the local leadership for accepting and enforcing the IMF conditions. Political instability can result from more leadership turnover as political leaders are replaced in electoral backlashes.<ref name="Jensen 2004, April, Issue 48" /> IMF conditions are often criticised for reducing government services, thus increasing unemployment.<ref name="chorev"/>

Another criticism is that IMF programs are only designed to address poor governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention in markets, and too much state ownership.<ref name="The End of Poverty" /> This assumes that this narrow range of issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised and differing contexts are ignored.<ref name="The End of Poverty" /> A country may also be compelled to accept conditions it would not normally accept had they not been in a financial crisis in need of assistance.<ref name="An Analysis of IMF Conditionality"/>

On top of that, regardless of what methodologies and data sets used, it comes to same the conclusion of exacerbating income inequality. With [[Gini coefficient]], it became clear that countries with IMF programs face increased income inequality.<ref name="The distributional effects of IMF program">{{cite book|last1=Garuda|first1=Gopal|title=The distributional effects of IMF program|year=1998|publisher=The Harvard university|location=Cambridge}}</ref>

It is claimed that [[conditionalities]] retard social stability and hence inhibit the stated goals of the IMF, while Structural Adjustment Programs lead to an increase in poverty in recipient countries.<ref name=Hertz>Hertz, [[Noreena]]. ''The Debt Threat''. New York: [[Harper Collins Publishers]], 2004.</ref> The IMF sometimes advocates "[[Austerity|austerity programmes]]", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even when the economy is weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing [[budget deficit]]s. Countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax rate. In ''[[Globalization and Its Discontents]]'', [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], former chief economist and senior vice-president at the [[World Bank]], criticises these policies.<ref name=Stiglitz>Stiglitz, Joseph. ''Globalization and its Discontents''. New York: WW Norton & Company, 2002.</ref> He argues that by converting to a more [[monetarist]] approach, the purpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out [[Keynesian]] reflations, and that the IMF "was not participating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and ideology of the Western financial community."<ref>{{cite web|author=More by Benjamin M. Friedman |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15630 |title=Globalization: Stiglitz's Case |publisher=Nybooks.com |date=15 August 2002 |access-date=30 May 2010}}</ref>

Stiglitz concludes, "Modern high-tech warfare is designed to remove physical contact: dropping bombs from 50,000 feet ensures that one does not 'feel' what one does. Modern economic management is similar: from one's luxury hotel, one can callously impose policies about which one would think twice if one knew the people whose lives one was destroying."<ref name=Stiglitz/>

The researchers Eric Toussaint and Damien Millet argue that the IMF's policies amount to a new form of colonization that does not need a military presence: 
{{quote|"Following the exigencies of the governments of the richest companies, the IMF, permitted countries in crisis to borrow in order to avoid default on their repayments. Caught in the debt's downward spiral, developing countries soon had no other recourse than to take on new debt in order to repay the old debt. Before providing them with new loans, at higher interest rates, future leaders asked the IMF, to intervene with the guarantee of ulterior reimbursement, asking for a signed agreement with the said countries. The IMF  thus agreed to restart the flow of the 'finance pump' on condition that the concerned countries first use this money to reimburse banks and other private lenders, while restructuring their economy at the IMF's discretion: these were the famous conditionalities, detailed in the Structural Adjustment Programs. The IMF and its ultra-liberal experts took control of the borrowing countries' economic policies. A new form of colonization was thus instituted. It was not even necessary to establish an administrative or military presence; the debt alone maintained this new form of submission."<ref>{{cite book|last=Toussaint and Millet|title=Debt, The IMF, and The world Bank|year=2010|publisher=Monthly Review Press U.S.|pages=83}}</ref>}}

International politics play an important role in IMF decision making. The clout of member states is roughly proportional to its contribution to IMF finances. The United States has the greatest number of votes and therefore wields the most influence. Domestic politics often come into play, with politicians in developing countries using conditionality to gain leverage over the opposition to influence policy.<ref name="IMF: Politics of Conditional Lending">{{cite book|last1=Vreeland|first1=James|title=The International Monetary Fund (IMF): Politics of Conditional Lending|year=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis Books UK|location=UK}}</ref>

===Reform===

====Function and policies====
The IMF is only one of many [[international organisations]], and it is a generalist institution that deals only with macroeconomic issues; its core areas of concern in [[developing countries]] are very narrow. One proposed reform is a movement towards close partnership with other specialist agencies such as [[UNICEF]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), and [[the United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP).<ref name="The End of Poverty" />

[[Jeffrey Sachs]] argues in ''[[The End of Poverty]]'' that the IMF and the World Bank have "the brightest economists and the lead in advising poor countries on how to break out of poverty, but the problem is development economics".<ref name="The End of Poverty" /> [[Development economics]] needs the reform, not the IMF. He also notes that IMF loan conditions should be paired with other reforms—e.g., trade reform in [[developed nations]], [[debt cancellation]], and increased financial assistance for investments in [[Infrastructure|basic infrastructure]].<ref name="The End of Poverty" /> IMF loan conditions cannot stand alone and produce change; they need to be partnered with other reforms or other conditions as applicable.<ref name="Lipscy 2015">{{cite journal |last1=Lipscy |first1=Phillip Y. |title=Explaining Institutional Change: Policy Areas, Outside Options, and the Bretton Woods Institutions |journal=American Journal of Political Science |date=2015 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=341–356 |doi=10.1111/ajps.12130}}</ref>

====US influence and voting reform====

The criticism of the American-and-European dominated IMF has led to what some consider 'disenfranchising the world' from the governance of the IMF. [[Raúl Prebisch]], the founding secretary-general of the [[UN Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), wrote that one of "the conspicuous deficiencies of the general economic theory, from the point of view of the periphery, is its false sense of universality."<ref>{{cite book|author=Dosman, J. Edgar|title=The Life and Times of Raúl Prebisch, 1901-1986|publisher=McGill-Queen University Press, Montreal|year=2008|pages=248–249}}</ref>

===Support of dictatorships===
The role of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods institutions]] has been controversial since the late [[Cold War]], because of claims that the IMF policy makers supported [[military dictatorship]]s friendly to American and European corporations, but also other [[anti-communist]] and [[Communist]] regimes (such as [[Zaire|Mobutu's Zaire]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Ceaușescu's Romania]], respectively). Critics also claim that the IMF is generally apathetic or hostile to human rights, and [[labour rights]]. The controversy has helped spark the [[anti-globalization movement]].

An example of IMF's support for a dictatorship was its ongoing support for [[Mobutu]]'s rule in [[Zaire]], although its own envoy, [[Erwin Blumenthal]], provided a sobering report about the entrenched corruption and embezzlement and the inability of the country to pay back any loans.<ref name=dvr>{{cite book| author=David van Reybrouck| title=Congo: The Epic History of a People| publisher=HarperCollins|year=2012 |page=374ff |isbn=978-0-06-220011-2| title-link=Congo: The Epic History of a People| author-link=David van Reybrouck}}</ref>

Arguments in favour of the IMF say that economic stability is a precursor to democracy; however, critics highlight various examples in which democratised countries fell after receiving IMF loans.<ref name='cadtm'>{{cite news|title=IMF support to dictatorships|publisher=World Bank|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article809|work=[[Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt]]|access-date=21 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012105817/http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article809|archive-date=12 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Impact on access to food===
A number of [[civil society]] organisations<ref>Oxfam, [https://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/policy/debt_aid/downloads/bp29_death.pdf Death on the Doorstep of the Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107192935/https://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/policy/debt_aid/downloads/bp29_death.pdf |date=7 January 2012 }}, August 2002.</ref> have criticised the IMF's policies for their impact on access to food, particularly in developing countries. In October 2008, former United States president [[Bill Clinton]] delivered a speech to the United Nations on [[World Food Day]], criticising the World Bank and IMF for their policies on food and agriculture:

{{quote|We need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including me when I was president. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, and we all have to go back to a more responsible and [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable form of agriculture]]. |Former U.S. president Bill Clinton|Speech at United Nations World Food Day, October 16, 2008<ref>Bill Clinton, [http://www.clintonfoundation.org/news/news-media/speech-united-nations-world-food-day "Speech: United Nations World Food Day"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20110605130326/http://www.clintonfoundation.org/news/news-media/speech-united-nations-world-food-day |date=5 June 2011 }}, 13 October 2008</ref>}}

The [[FPIF]] remarked that there is a recurring pattern: "the destabilization of peasant producers by a one-two punch of IMF-[[World Bank]] structural adjustment programs that gutted government investment in the countryside followed by the massive influx of subsidized U.S. and European Union agricultural imports after the [[WTO]]'s Agreement on Agriculture pried open markets."<ref name="Foreign Policy In Focus 2008">{{cite web | title=Destroying African Agriculture | website=[[Foreign Policy In Focus]] | date=3 June 2008 | url=https://fpif.org/destroying_african_agriculture/ | access-date=22 August 2018|quote=At the time of decolonization in the 1960s, Africa was not just self-sufficient in food but was actually a net food exporter, its exports averaging 1.3 million tons a year between 1966-70. Today, the continent imports 25% of its food, with almost every country being a net food importer.}}</ref>

===Impact on public health===
A 2009 study concluded that the strict conditions resulted in thousands of deaths in Eastern Europe by [[tuberculosis]] as [[public health care]] had to be weakened. In the 21 countries to which the IMF had given loans, [[tuberculosis]] deaths rose by 16.6%.<ref>[http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050143&ct=1 International Monetary Fund Programs and Tuberculosis Outcomes in Post-Communist Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920071410/http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050143&ct=1 |date=20 September 2008 }} [[PLoS Medicine]].

In 2009, a book by Rick Rowden titled ''The Deadly Ideas of [[Neoliberalism]]: How the IMF has Undermined Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS'', claimed that the IMF's monetarist approach towards prioritising price stability (low inflation) and fiscal restraint (low budget deficits) was unnecessarily restrictive and has prevented developing countries from scaling up long-term investment in public health infrastructure. The book claimed the consequences have been chronically underfunded public health systems, leading to demoralising working conditions that have fuelled a "[[brain drain]]" of medical personnel, all of which has undermined public health and the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]] in developing countries.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism: How the IMF has Undermined Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS|author=Rowden, Rick|year=2009|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-284-9}}</ref>

In 2016, the IMF's research department published a report titled "Neoliberalism: Oversold?" which, while praising some aspects of the "[[neoliberal]] agenda," claims that the organisation has been "overselling" fiscal [[austerity]] policies and financial deregulation, which they claim has exacerbated both financial crises and [[economic inequality]] around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/06/the-imf-confronts-its-n-word-neoliberalism/

===Impact on environment===
IMF policies have been repeatedly criticised for making it difficult for indebted countries to say no to [[environmental damage|environmentally harmful]] projects that nevertheless generate [[revenue]]s such as [[petroleum industry|oil]], coal, and [[deforestation|forest-destroying]] lumber and agriculture projects. Ecuador, for example, had to defy IMF advice repeatedly to pursue the protection of its [[rainforest]]s, though paradoxically this need was cited in the IMF argument to provide support to Ecuador. The IMF acknowledged this paradox in the 2010 report that proposed the IMF Green Fund, a mechanism to issue [[special drawing rights]] directly to pay for climate harm prevention and potentially other ecological protection as pursued generally by other [[environmental finance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/spn1006.pdf |title=Financing the Response to Climate Change, Staff Position Note 10/06, March 25, 2010 |access-date=30 May 2010}}</ref>

While the response to these moves was generally positive<ref>{{cite web|last1=Robert |first1=Adam |url=http://www.globalissues.org/news/2010/03/25/4980 |title=Finance: IMF Proposes 100-Billion-Dollar Climate Fund|publisher=Globalissues.org |date=25 March 2010 |access-date=30 May 2010}}</ref> possibly because ecological protection and energy and infrastructure transformation are more politically neutral than pressures to change social policy, some experts{{who|date=February 2019}} voiced concern that the IMF was not representative, and that the IMF proposals to generate only US$200&nbsp;billion a year by 2020 with the SDRs as seed funds, did not go far enough to undo the general incentive to pursue destructive projects inherent in the world [[commodity trading]] and banking systems—criticisms often levelled at the [[World Trade Organization]] and large global banking institutions.

In the context of the [[European debt crisis]], some observers{{who|date=February 2019}} noted that{{When|date=March 2021}} Spain and California, two troubled economies{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} within respectively the European Union and the United States, and also Germany, the primary and politically most fragile supporter of a [[euro]] currency bailout would benefit from IMF recognition of their leadership in [[green technology]], and directly from Green Fund-generated demand for their exports, which could also improve their [[credit ratings]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==IMF and globalization==
[[Globalization]] encompasses three institutions: global financial markets and [[transnational companies]], national governments linked to each other in economic and military alliances led by the United States, and rising "global governments" such as [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), IMF, and [[World Bank]].<ref name="People Before Profit">{{cite book|last1=Derber|first1=Charles|title=People Before Profit|url=https://archive.org/details/peoplebeforeprof00derb|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Picador|location=New York}}</ref> [[Charles Derber]] argues in his book ''People Before Profit,'' "These interacting institutions create a new global power system where sovereignty is globalized, taking power and constitutional authority away from nations and giving it to global markets and international bodies".<ref name="People Before Profit" /> Titus Alexander argues that this system institutionalises global inequality between western countries and the Majority World in a form of [[global apartheid]], in which the IMF is a key pillar.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Titus|title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: an overview of world politics|year=1996|publisher=Polity press|pages=127–133}}</ref>

The establishment of globalised economic institutions has been both a symptom of and a stimulus for globalisation. The development of the World Bank, the IMF, [[International financial institutions#Regional development banks|regional development banks]] such as the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD), and multilateral trade institutions such as the WTO signals a move away from the dominance of the state as the primary actor analysed in international affairs. Globalization has thus been transformative in terms of a reconceptualising of [[state sovereignty]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Robert|author2=Richard Fairbrother|title=Globalization and Human Rights|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=August 1999|volume=21|issue=3|pages=735–766|doi=10.1353/hrq.1999.0041|s2cid=144228739}}</ref>

Following United States President [[Bill Clinton]]'s administration's aggressive financial [[deregulation]] campaign in the 1990s, globalisation leaders overturned long standing restrictions by governments that limited foreign ownership of their banks, deregulated currency exchange, and eliminated restrictions on how quickly money could be withdrawn by foreign investors.<ref name="People Before Profit" />

===Impact on gender equality===
The IMF supports women's empowerment and tries to promote their rights in countries with a significant gender gap.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/themes/gender/|title=Gender and IMF, Gender in the workforce|website=www.imf.org}}</ref>
