'''Warren L. Coats, Jr.''' (born May 19, 1942 in Bakersfield, Calif.), is an economist specializing in monetary policy. He retired from the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 2003 to join the board of directors of the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]]. He is president of Economic Consulting, providing technical assistance to central banks, and until recently was adviser to the central banks of Afghanistan (for the IMF) and Kazakhstan (for the government of Kazakhstan).

==Early life==
Coats was born and raised in Bakersfield, California, where he graduated from [[Bakersfield High School]] in 1960 in absentia while spending his senior year abroad with the [http://www.icye.org/ International Christian Youth Exchange] in the German village of Rasdorf. While in Germany he lived with the family of Albert Martin for a year and attended the Gymnasium in Hünfeld near Fulda.

From 1960 to 1962, Coats attended [[Bakersfield College]], where he co-founded and edited the ''Weekly Blatt'',<ref>http://www2.bc.cc.ca.us/bcarchive/content/03/V/04/a/(02)/03-V-04-a-(02)--V7-1.pdf</ref> an underground weekly campus newspaper dedicated to presenting conservative and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] political perspectives on current events.

During 1962–66 Coats attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and received a B.A. in Economics in June 1966. At Berkeley, he served as president of several organizations, including the University Young Republicans (UYR), the University Conservatives, and his fraternity, [[Alpha Tau Omega]]. As president of the UYR, he was a member of the [[Free Speech Movement]] coordinating committee and allied with the presidents of the University Young Democrats, University Conservatives, and the [[Young People's Socialist League]] in an effort to restore free speech to the campus without violence.

In 1966–70 Coats studied economics at the [[University of Chicago]]. His doctoral dissertation was on ''The September 1968 Changes in 'Regulation D' and Their Implications for Monetary Supply Control,'' with [[Milton Friedman]]<ref name=MSkousen>{{cite web|last=Skousen|first=Mark|title=Milton Friedman Turns 100 Today — the Day I Tore up his $20 Bill!|url=http://www.mskousen.com/2012/07/milton-friedman-turns-100-today-the-day-i-tore-up-his-20-bill/|publisher=MSkousen.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>  heading his dissertation committee. His Ph.D was granted in 1972. While studying at Chicago, Coats taught part-time at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (1966–1967 and 1968–1970). In 1968 he took a leave of absence to join Louise Wilkinson at the [[University of Hawaii]] in Honolulu, where both were assistant professors. They married in Hawaii before returning to Chicago to resume their graduate studies. Coats has several children and grandchildren. His partner for the last 20+ years is Dr Ito Briones, a physician and artist.

==Career==
Coats was an assistant professor of economics at the [[University of Virginia]] from 1970–75 and assistant chairman of the economics department in 1975. He joined the IMF at the beginning of 1976 and became chief of the [[Special Drawing Rights]] (SDR) division in the finance department in 1983. He is author of two books and editor or co-editor of three books on money and banking topics and more than two dozen articles on the SDR and other monetary topics.

In January 1992, Coats rejoined what is now the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM) in the IMF to lead a technical assistance mission to Bulgaria followed by back-to-back missions to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. His career focused on an intensive program of developing new central banks and currencies that lasted beyond his retirement. He has led more than 70 missions that have provided practical advice and assistance to central banks around the globe often under crisis conditions. These include missions to Afghanistan, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, Iraq,<ref name=Bakersfield>{{cite news|last=Stevenson|first=Joe|title=Iraq latest trouble spot visited by former IMF official|url=http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/archive/x922532823/Iraq-latest-trouble-spot-visited-by-former-IMF-official|accessdate=1 September 2012|newspaper=The Bakersfield Californian|date=February 10, 2006}}</ref>  Israel, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Malta, Moldova, Nigeria, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Sudan, Turkey, the West Bank and Gaza Strip<ref name=Amsterdam>{{cite web|last=Amsterdam|first=Robert|title=Warren Coats on Democracy|url=http://robertamsterdam.com/2008/05/warren_coats_on_democracy/|publisher=RobertAmsterdam.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He supervised the establishment of new central banks in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], and the reestablishment, transformation, and development of the payment and banking systems in [[Kosovo]], and helped Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and later Bosnia and Herzegovina and South Sudan introduce their own currencies.

Coats’ work on banking sector issues in Moldova, Bulgaria, Croatia, Turkey and Yugoslavia has provided him with the practical experience reflected in his several articles on banking sector soundness issues (including several papers on [http://works.bepress.com/warren_coats/17/ Bank Insolvency Law]). He has also written on various monetary theory and policy issues, including digital money and inflation targeting. He edited a book on Inflation Targeting in Transition Economies published by the IMF and the Czech National Bank and co-edited a book on the same subject published by the Czech National Bank in 2003. The difficult negotiations he led for the IMF to establish a new central bank following the end of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina are chronicled in his book, ''One Currency for Bosnia: Creating the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina'', published in August, 2007, by Jameson Books.<ref>{{cite web|title=SelectedWorks of Warren Coats|url=http://works.bepress.com/warren_coats/|publisher=bepress|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>

Coats’ monetary advice has not always been trouble free. At a widely attended press conference in Kabul in January 2002, Coats was asked by [[Mark Landler]], a ''New York Times'' reporter whether the IMF was recommending that Afghanistan replace the existing currency with U.S. dollars. He responded that dollarization was one of the options under consideration. When he failed to explain that if the policy to dollarize were adopted then the existing currency would be redeemed for dollars, the Afghani immediately depreciated about 25%. The next day acting central bank governor Abdul Fitrat detailed more fully how the adoption of dollarization (which was rejected in any event), would work and the exchange rate recovered fully within a day.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite news|last=Landler|first=Mark|title=I.M.F.

At the time he retired from the IMF in May, 2003, to become a Director of the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]] (CIMA),<ref>{{cite web|title=Contributors at a Glance: Warren L. Coats|url=http://www.compasscayman.com/cfr/bio.aspx?id=1070|publisher=Cayman Financial Review|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref> Coats was the Assistant Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). Coats was a visiting economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1979 and was seconded to the World Bank for one year to help write the [http://wdronline.worldbank.org/worldbank/a/c.html/world_development_report_1989/abstract/WB.0-1952-0788-2.abstract.sec1 1989 World Development Report] on the Financial System.

Following his IMF retirement, he continued providing technical assistance to central banks<ref name=C-SPAN>{{cite web|title=Debate on Abolishing the Federal Reserve|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/287860-1|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>  as a consultant with the IMF, BearingPoint, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Treasury, [[Overseas Development Institute]], and [[Deloitte]] Consulting.

Coats is a member of Alpha Tau Omega (past president of Berkeley chapter), [[American Economic Association]], The [[Mont Pelerin Society]], [[Order of the Golden Bear]], The [[Philadelphia Society]] (past member of board of directors), and the [http://www.weai.org/index.html Western Economic Association International], (past member of the executive committee).<ref name=CoatsBlog>{{cite web|title=Warren's Space|url=http://wcoats.wordpress.com/|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>

His honors include Kyrgyzstan’s Certificate of Honor, presented by President Askar Akaev in Bishkek in 1997,<ref name="IMF Agenda">{{cite web|title=Challenges to Economies in Transition: Stabilization, Growth, and Governance|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/eu2/kyrgyz/index.htm|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> in recognition of his work to prepare Kyrgyzstan to introduce its own currency, and he was inducted into [[Confrérie de la Chaîne des Rôtisseurs]] in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1999. He has been a fellow of Johns Hopkins [[Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences]], [[Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise]] since 2018. He received the 2019 Central Banking Award for Outstanding Contribution for Central Bank Capacity Building.<ref name="Awards">{{cite web|title=Outstanding Contribution for Capacity Building|url=https://www.centralbanking.com/awards/3979781/outstanding-contribution-for-capacity-building-warren-coats |publisher=Central Banking Journal|accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref>
