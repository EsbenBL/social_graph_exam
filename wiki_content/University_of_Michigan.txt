The '''University of Michigan''' ('''UM''', '''U-M''', '''U of M''', '''UMich''', or '''Michigan''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Founded in 1817 by an act of the old [[Michigan Territory]], as the [[History of the University of Michigan#The Catholepistemiad (1817–1821)|''Catholepistemiad'']], or the ''University of Michigania'', 20 years before the [[Michigan Territory|territory]] became a state, the university is [[Michigan]]'s oldest. The school was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the flagship university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than {{convert|780|acre|km2}} spread out over Central Campus and North Campus, two [[satellite campuses]] in [[University of Michigan–Flint|Flint]] and [[University of Michigan–Dearborn|Dearborn]] (each separately accredited universities), and a [[University of Michigan Detroit Center|Center]] in Detroit. Since the university had already been in existence for two decades before the territory earned statehood in 1837, the university was granted [[Autonomous university|autonomy]] by the [[Constitution of Michigan|state constitution]]. The university has been governed by [[Regents of the University of Michigan|an elected board of regents]] independently of the state since 1850, when the state's [[Constitution of Michigan|second constitution]] was officially adopted. At Michigan, nearly half of the students are now from out of state.

Michigan has ranked among the top universities in the United States by college and university rankings.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=September 9, 2020|title=Top Public Colleges & Universities|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 January 2021|website=U.S. News & World Report}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-07|title=Best public universities in the United States 2021|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-public-universities-united-states|access-date=2021-01-18|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=zh-hans}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=2021 Top Public Universities in America|url=https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/top-public-universities/|access-date=2021-01-18|website=Niche|language=en}}</ref> The university is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".<ref name="Carnegie"/> Michigan offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and [[STEM fields]] (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as well as professional degrees in architecture, business, medicine, law, public policy, pharmacy, nursing, social work, public health, and dentistry.

From 1900 to 1920, the growth of [[higher education]] led the university to build numerous new facilities, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, chemistry, natural sciences, Hill Auditorium, large hospital and library complexes, and two residence halls. The [[Martha Cook Building]] was constructed as an all-female residence in 1915 as the result of a gift from [[William W.

In 1920, the university reorganized the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and formed an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives.

After World War II, enrollment expanded and by 1950, it reached 21,000. In 1947, the regents appointed a War Memorial Committee to consider establishing a war memorial in honor of students and alumni who fell in World War II, and in 1948, approved a resolution to “create a war memorial center to explore the ways and means by which the potentialities of atomic energy may become a beneficent influence in the life of man, to be known as the Phoenix Project of the University of Michigan,” leading to the world’s first academic program in nuclear science and engineering.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=August 28, 2010 |url=http://www.energy.umich.edu/about/#history |title=MMPEI–History |publisher=Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute |archive-date=December 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229015555/http://www.energy.umich.edu/about |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="um2017.org"/> The Memorial Phoenix Project was funded by over 25,000 private contributors by individuals and corporations, such as the [[Ford Motor Company]].<ref>{{cite journal|first = Joseph D.|last=Martin|date=February 2016 |title = The Peaceful Atom Comes to Campus|journal = Physics Today|volume = 69|issue = 2|pages = 40–46|doi=10.1063/pt.3.3081|bibcode=2016PhT....69b..40M|doi-access = free}}</ref>

In April 1968, following the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff.

In the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus. In its 2011 annual financial report, the university announced that it had dedicated $497 million per year in each of the prior 10 years to renovate buildings and infrastructure around the campus.

In the early 2000s, Michigan faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls.

U-M's golf course is located south of Michigan Stadium and Crisler Arena. It was designed in the late 1920s by [[Alister MacKenzie]], the designer of [[Augusta National Golf Club]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]], home of the [[Masters Tournament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/golf-course.html|title=University of Michigan Golf Course|work=MGoBlue|publisher=University of Michigan Athletic Department|access-date=August 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901045032/http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/golf-course.html|archive-date=September 1, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The course opened to the public in the spring of 1931. The University of Michigan Golf Course was included in a listing of top holes designed by what ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' calls "golf's greatest course architect". The U-M Golf Course's signature No. 6 hole—a {{convert|310|yd|m|-1|adj=on}} par 4, which plays from an elevated tee to a two-tiered, kidney-shaped green protected by four bunkers—is the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five-person panel that includes three-time Masters champion [[Nick Faldo]] and golf course architect [[Tom Doak]].

The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in [[University of Michigan–Dearborn|Dearborn]] and [[University of Michigan-Flint|Flint]]. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections<ref name=Hebel2004>{{harvnb|Hebel|2004}}</ref> for overlapping eight-year terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regents.umich.edu/about/|title=About the Board of Regents|publisher=University of Michigan Board of Regents|access-date=December 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221204929/http://www.regents.umich.edu/about/|archive-date=December 21, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=October 3, 2007 |access-date=December 26, 2008 |url=https://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/regents/history.php |title=Regents of the University of Michigan: Historical Background |publisher=Bentley Historical Library |archive-date=September 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908002643/http://www.bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/regents/history.php |url-status=dead }}</ref> Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did.

The [[President of the University of Michigan]] is the principal executive officer of the university.

===Student government===

Housed in the Michigan Union, the [[Student governments in the United States#University of Michigan|Central Student Government]] (CSG) is the central student government of the university. With representatives from each of the university's colleges and schools, including graduate students, CSG represents students and manages student funds on the campus. CSG is a 501(c)(3) organization, independent from the University of Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://csg.umich.edu/files/files/FY%202012.pdf|title=IRS Form 990, FY 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018114552/https://csg.umich.edu/files/files/FY%202012.pdf|archive-date=October 18, 2014}}</ref> In recent years CSG has organized Airbus, a transportation service between campus and the [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]], and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004. VYV also works to improve access to non-partisan voting-related information and increase student voter turnout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msa.umich.edu/mgovote2006/about.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003010504/http://www.msa.umich.edu/mgovote2006/about.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 3, 2007 |title=About Voice Your Vote |year=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan CSG |access-date=March 21, 2007 }}</ref> CSG was successful at reviving [[Homecoming]] activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007,<ref>{{cite news|last=Shubert |first=Cathe |url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/09/19/StudentGovernment/Homecoming.Parade.Carnival.To.Return-2977420.shtml |title=Homecoming parade, carnival to return |work=The Michigan Daily |date=September 19, 2007 |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426130223/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/09/19/StudentGovernment/Homecoming.Parade.Carnival.To.Return-2977420.shtml |archive-date=April 26, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and during the 2013–14 school year, was instrumental in persuading the university to rescind an unpopular change in student football seating policy at Michigan Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|last=Woodhouse|first=Kellie|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/03/how_a_persistent_student_presi.html|title=How a Persistent Student Government Got Michigan to Scrap General Admission Football Seating|date=March 12, 2014|publisher=MLive|access-date=October 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017150125/http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/03/how_a_persistent_student_presi.html|archive-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, CSG successfully petitioned the Ann Arbor City Council to create a Student Advisory Council to give student input into Ann Arbor city affairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ann Arbor City Council Unanimously Approves Student Advisory Council|url=https://csg.umich.edu/2017/01/19/ann-arbor-city-council-unanimously-approves-student-advisory-council/|access-date=April 2, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403194746/https://csg.umich.edu/2017/01/19/ann-arbor-city-council-unanimously-approves-student-advisory-council/|archive-date=April 3, 2017}}</ref>

There are student governance bodies in each college and school, independent of Central Student Government. Undergraduate students in the LS&A are represented by the LS&A Student Government (LSA SG).<ref>{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=https://csg.umich.edu/about/who-we-are|access-date=February 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515010245/https://csg.umich.edu/about/who-we-are|archive-date=May 15, 2013}}</ref>  Engineering Student Government (ESG) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government (RSG), and law students are represented by the Law School Student Senate (LSSS) as is each other college with its own respective government. In addition, the students who live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association (RHA), which contains the third most constituents after CSG and LSA SG.<ref>{{cite web|title=Residence Hall Government|url=http://www.housing.umich.edu/reshalls/rha|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204230644/http://www.housing.umich.edu/reshalls/rha|archive-date=February 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

A longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body.<ref name="student regent">{{cite news|url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/jun/06-29-98/edit/edit1.html |title=Denied again: University should have a student regent |work=The Michigan Daily |date=June 29, 1998 |access-date=September 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013100636/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/jun/06-29-98/edit/edit1.html |archive-date=October 13, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents.

=== Collegiate secret societies ===

The University of Michigan hosts three secret societies: Michigauma, Adara, and the Vulcans. Michigauma and Adara were once under the umbrella group "The Tower Society", the name referring to their historical locations in the Michigan Union tower. Michigauma was all-male while Adara was all-female, although both later became co-ed.

*[[Order of Angell|Michigauma]], more recently known as the Order of Angell, was formed in 1902 by a group of seniors in coordination with University president James Burrill Angell. The group disbanded itself in 2021 due to public concerns about elitism and the society's history. The group was granted a lease for the top floor of the Michigan Union tower in 1932, which they referred to as the "tomb," but the society vacated the space in 2000. Until more recent reforms, the group's rituals were inspired by the culture of [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]].<ref name="michigamua">{{cite web |url=http://www.goodspeedupdate.com/michigamua-images.html |title=Michigamua Image Gallery |access-date=2008-05-09}}</ref> Some factions on campus identified Michigauma as a [[secret society]], but many disputed that characterization, as its member list has been published some years in ''[[The Michigan Daily]]'' and the ''[[Michiganensian]]'', and online since 2006 reforms. 
*Adara, known as Phoenix, was formed in the late 1970s by women leaders on campus and disbanded itself in 2021 amid campus criticisms of secret societies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Horne|first=Brooke Van|date=1970-01-01|title=Phoenix, a secret society at U-M, votes to disband permanently|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/campus-life/phoenix-female-only-secret-society-u-m-votes-disband/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=The Michigan Daily|language=en-US}}</ref> In the early 1980s they joined the tower society and occupied the sixth floor of the tower just below Michigamua.
*Vulcans, occupied the fifth floor of the Union tower though were not formally a part of the tower society. They draw their heritage from the Roman god [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. The group which used to do its tapping publicly is known for its long black robes and for its financial contributions of the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]].

===Fight songs and chants===
The University of Michigan's [[fight song]], "[[The Victors]]," was written by student Louis Elbel in 1898 following the last-minute football victory over the [[University of Chicago]] that won a league championship. The song was declared by [[John Philip Sousa]] as "the greatest college fight song ever written."<ref>{{cite book |author=Michael Hondorp, Fabrikant Alexis |title=University of Michigan College Prowler Off the Record|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=College Prowler, Inc|isbn=1-59658-163-8|page=118}}</ref> The song refers to the university as being "the Champions of the West." At the time, U-M was part of the Western Conference, which would later become the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old [[Northwest Territory]].

Although mainly used at sporting events, the Michigan fight song is often heard at other events as well. President [[Gerald Ford]] had it played by the [[United States Marine Band]] as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977, in preference over the more traditional "[[Hail to the Chief]]",<ref>{{cite book |last=Rozell |first=Mark J. |title=The Press and the Ford Presidency|date=October 15, 1992|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10350-4|page=38}}</ref> and the [[Michigan Marching Band]] performed a slow-tempo variation of the fight song at his funeral.<ref>{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Michelle|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/02/politics/main2320308.shtml|title=Gerald Ford Returns Home For The Last Time|date=January 3, 2007|work=CBS News|access-date=February 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221044716/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/02/politics/main2320308.shtml|archive-date=February 21, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's [[alma mater]] song is "[[The Yellow and Blue]]." A common rally cry is "[[Let's Go Blue|Let's Go Blue!]]" which has a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a [[Drum major (marching band)|drum major]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Stieg |first=Bill |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122081/index.htm |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |date=May 21, 1984 |work=Sports Illustrated |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202160254/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122081/index.htm |archive-date=December 2, 2008 |access-date=December 25, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
