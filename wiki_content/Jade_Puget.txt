'''Jade Errol Puget''' (born November 28, 1973) is an American musician and producer, best known as the guitarist for the rock band [[AFI (band)|AFI]] (joined in 1998), the guitarist/writer for the [[straight edge]] [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] band [[XTRMST]], and the keyboardist/synthesizer operator for the [[electronica|electronic]] duo [[Blaqk Audio]]. Puget is vegetarian and [[straight edge]].<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI Guitarist Jade Puget On XTRMST + Straight Edge Hardcore|url= http://diffuser.fm/jade-puget-xtrmst-interview/ |publisher=Diffuser.fm|first=Tim|last=Karan|access-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
Before joining AFI on November 2, 1998, Jade Puget played in various bands, including Loose Change and [[Redemption 87]].<ref>[http://www.afireinside.net/bio/default.aspx]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201223040/http://www.afireinside.net/bio/default.aspx|date=December 1, 2007}}</ref> His first album with AFI was 1999's ''[[Black Sails in the Sunset]]''.

The first song he wrote for the band was "Malleus Maleficarum".<ref>''I Heard a Voice'' DVD</ref> Puget's addition to the band introduced fans to a more melodically acute and dynamic sound that was vastly different from earlier material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/18104|title=Interviews: Jade Puget (AFI)|publisher=Punknews.org|access-date=October 25, 2014}}</ref>

AFI next released the ''[[All Hallow's E.P.]]'' in October 1999, which featured various elements of [[horror punk]] and a sound disparate from much of the band's earlier material. The EP's single was "[[Totalimmortal]]". The song received some airplay on television programs such as [[MTV2]], and was even covered by [[The Offspring]] for use in the film ''[[Me, Myself, and Irene]]''.

The year 2000 saw the release of ''[[The Art of Drowning (album)|The Art of Drowning]]''. The album sold 88,000 copies by March 2002<ref>"AFI – Burn Unit." Guitar World, March 2002. Page 31.</ref> and the single, "[[The Days of the Phoenix]]", peaked at number 152 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

After ''The Art of Drowning'', AFI were signed by the major label [[DreamWorks Records]] in 2002. ''[[Sing the Sorrow]]'', AFI's major label debut, was released in March 2003. The album yielded three singles that found success on the U.S. [[Alternative Songs]] chart: "[[Girl's Not Grey]]" (No. 7), "[[The Leaving Song Pt. II]]" (No. 16), and "[[Silver and Cold]]" (No. 7). The album was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=AFI&format=&LP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2007&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=RIAA – Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – October 25, 2014|publisher=Riaa.com|access-date=October 25, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151656/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=AFI&format=&LP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2007&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref>

''[[Decemberunderground]]'', the follow-up to ''Sing the Sorrow'', was released in June 2006. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling over 182,000 copies in its first week. The single, "[[Miss Murder]]," peaked at No. 1 on the Alternative Songs chart for five weeks and also reached No. 24 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album produced the singles "[[Love Like Winter]]" (No. 4) and "[[The Missing Frame]]" (No. 17). ''Decemberunderground'' sold over 993,000 copies by 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267404/afi-revs-up-the-rock-on-crash-course|title=AFI Revs Up The Rock On 'Crash Course'|date=September 14, 2009|work=Billboard|access-date=October 25, 2014}}</ref>

In 2007, Puget and AFI bandmate [[Davey Havok]] released the album ''[[CexCells]]'' as the electronic duo [[Blaqk Audio]]. The album reached No. 18 on the Billboard 200 and featured the single "[[Stiff Kittens]]", which peaked at No. 20 on the Alternative Songs chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2007-09-01/alternative-songs|title=Alternative Songs|date=December 19, 2012|work=Billboard|access-date=October 25, 2014}}</ref>

AFI's eighth studio album, ''[[Crash Love]]'', was released in September 2009 and debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/on-the-charts-barbra-streisand-stuns-paramore-and-mariah-carey-20091007|title=On the Charts: Barbra Streisand Stuns Paramore and Mariah Carey|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=October 25, 2014}}</ref> The album produced the two singles: "[[Medicate]]", and "[[Beautiful Thieves]]", which charted at No. 7 and No. 23 on the Alternative Songs Chart, respectively. In the time off after the Crash Love tour, Puget and Havok returned to Blaqk Audio, releasing their second album, ''[[Bright Black Heaven]]'', made available September 11, 2012.<ref>{{Citation|title=Bright Black Heaven by Blaqk Audio|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/bright-black-heaven/1045598439|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>

On October 22, 2013, AFI's 9th studio album, ''[[Burials (album)|Burials]]'', was released. In the months prior to the release, two songs were released as singles. The first, ''[[I Hope You Suffer]]'', was released July 22. The second single, ''[[17 Crimes]]'', was released August 6. The album received mixed reviews, with the most notable one being from Mike Powell of ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'', giving the album a meagre 2/5 stars, and commenting that, "'17 Crimes' and 'Greater Than 84' survive with the band's flair for camp still intact. Others drown in pools of eyeliner. Flamboyant, serious, plagued by problems he never gets too specific about, Davey Havok invents a role part Morrissey, part Bret Michaels – hair-metal pinup for the Hot Topic era."{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In February 2014, numerous cassette tapes were distributed from record shops in Southern California, titled "XTRMST" and described as "Straight edge hardcore". In the following weeks, numerous sources leaked rumors that XTRMST was a side project of Puget and [[Davey Havok]]. Shortly after, Puget confirmed on his Twitter account that XTRMST was indeed a product of him and Havok.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jadepuget/status/445363872455598080|title=Jade Puget on Twitter: "Now that the cat is out of the bag, XTRMST is indeed Davey and I. More to come."|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=March 16, 2014}}</ref>

On October 2, 2014, it was announced the XTRMST would release a full-length LP, available on November 18. The album was made available for purchase either digitally or on vinyl record. Puget has stated that he and Havok had no intent on releasing a full-length record, but the overwhelming positive reaction motivated them to move forward with the project.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Personal life==
Puget has a half-sister named Alisha, a half-brother named Gibson, and a younger brother named Smith, who is also AFI's tour manager. Gibson appears in the poem in the interlude of "...But Home Is Nowhere" full-length album version ''[[Sing the Sorrow]]''.

With straight As throughout his K-12 career, Puget dropped out of school at the age of 17{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and continued his education at [[UC Berkeley]], where he received a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1996. After graduating from college, Puget joined AFI.

Puget has various tattoos, including an "18" (which was originally a "13"), a cat jumping through a 9 (a tattoo he shares with Nick 13 of [[Tiger Army]] and [[Davey Havok]]), and the word "committed" arched across his stomach. On his arms, he has the words "Boys Don't Cry" (a homage to [[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure song)|The Cure]]) and the words "[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]" (a [[Joy Division]] tribute).
