'''Edmond Malinvaud''' (25 April 1923 – 7 March 2015) was a French [[economist]]. He was the first president of the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]].<ref>{{cite news|title=L'économiste Edmond Malinvaud est décédé|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2015/03/10/l-economiste-edmond-malinvaud-est-decede_4590569_3234.html|access-date=10 March 2015|agency=Le Monde|publisher=La Vie-Le Monde|date=10 March 2015|language=fr}}</ref>

Trained at the [[École Polytechnique]] and at the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique ([[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique|ENSAE]]) in Paris, Malinvaud was a student of [[Maurice Allais]].
In 1950, Malinvaud left Allais to join the [[Cowles Commission]] in the United States. At Cowles, Malinvaud produced work in many directions. His famous article, "Capital Accumulation and the Efficient Allocation of Resources" (1953), provided an intertemporal theory of capital for [[general equilibrium theory]] and introduced the concept of dynamic efficiency. He became director of the ENSAE (1962–1966), director of the forecast department of French Treasury (1972–1974), director of the [[INSEE]] (1974–1987) and Professor at the [[Collège de France]] (1988–1993).

He also worked on uncertainty theory, notably the theory of "first order certainty equivalence" (1969) and the relationship between individual risks and social risks (1972, 1973). His 1971 microeconomics textbook and his econometrics textbook, ''Statistical Methods in Econometrics'', have since become classics.

Malinvaud's main contribution to macroeconomics is represented in his slim 1977 book, ''Theory of Unemployment Reconsidered'' which provided a clear and unified reconstruction of dynamic "disequilibrium" macroeconomics; this theory built on previous results of  [[Robert W. Clower|Clower]], [[Axel Leijonhufvud|Leijonhufvud]], and "Non-Walrasian" theory. Malinvaud's influence on the subsequent generation of European economists has been profound.
