== Biography ==

=== Early Life and Background ===
Luckmann was born in [[Jesenice, Jesenice|Jesenice]], which at the time was  part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. His father was an [[Austria]]n industrialist, while his mother was from a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] family from [[Ljubljana]].<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |last1=Novotný |first1=Lukáš |title=Sociální a komunikativní konstrukce reality – vzpomínka na Thomase Luckmanna |trans-title=Social and communicative construction of reality - memory of Thomas Luckmann |language=cs |journal=Sociologický časopis |date=2016 |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=581–589 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=423553 |id={{ProQuest|1836869345}} |jstor=43920836 }}</ref> On his mother's side, he was the cousin of the Slovene poet '''[[:sl:Božo_Vodušek|Božo Vodušek]]'''.

He attended Slovene-language schools while in Jesenice until the year 1941, when the occupation of Slovenia during World War II forced him to transfer to a high school in Austria. 

He and his mother relocated to Vienna in 1943, after the death of his father and several other relatives during [[World War II]].<ref name=":2" /> Living in Austria during this period automatically granted him German citizenship, and in 1944 he was drafted for the army,<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Endreß |first1=Martin |title=Thomas Luckmann (October 14, 1927–May 10, 2016) |journal=Human Studies |date=November 2016 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=487–491 |doi=10.1007/s10746-016-9416-2 |s2cid=151719771 }}</ref> joining the [[Luftwaffe]] where he served as a [[Luftwaffenhelfer]].<ref>Thomas Luckmann: ''„Teilweise zufällig, teilweise, weil es doch Spaß macht“.''

After liberation, in 1945 Luckmann became a [[prisoner of war]] and escaped after three months. He then settled in Vienna.<ref name=":0" />

=== Education ===
Luckmann attended high school in Klagenfurt, after he and his family fled Italian occupation in Ljubljana in 1941. After escaping being a prisoner of war, Luckmann began studying [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Vienna]] and [[University of Innsbruck|Innsbruck]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1950 he married Benita Petkevic, with whom he moved to the United States, where he studied at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=":1" /> The couple had three daughters.<ref name=":2" />
[[File:Social Construction of Reality.png|thumb|The Social Construction of Reality]]
It was his time at The New College, did Luckmann begin to discern his career as a sociologist. He was introduced to the sociological discipline, was familiarized with Alfred Sch[[Alfred Schütz|ü]]<nowiki/>tz’s work on sociological phenomenology, and met Peter Berger, where he would later go on to co-author ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''. Together, he and his colleagues produced some of the most influential sociological works of the 20th century.

Luckmann never intended to become a sociologist. His initial academic interests resided in linguistics, history and philosophy. At The New School, Luckmann primarily studied philosophy and chose to study sociology as a second subject after admiring how his teachers specialized in these dual subjects.<ref name=":7" /> For example, Luckmann was introduced to the sociology of religion when his teacher at the time, Carl Meyer, asked him to do field work about churches in Germany after World War II. Captivated by his experience in Germany, Luckmann used his fieldwork to pursue a Ph.D in sociology.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal |last1=Dreher |first1=Jochen |last2=Göttlich |first2=Andreas |title=Structures of a Life-Work: A Reconstruction of the Oeuvre of Thomas Luckmann |journal=Human Studies |date=March 2016 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=27–49 |doi=10.1007/s10746-016-9392-6 |s2cid=147459455 |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-2-g37is75x7h360 }}</ref>

He obtained his first academic position at Hobart College, in Geneva, New York, before returning to teach at The New School after the death of Alfred Sch[[Alfred Schütz|ü]]<nowiki/>tz. Luckmann was eventually granted a professorship position at The University of Frankfurt in 1965. After publishing two books in 1963 and 1966, and several successful essays, Luckmann worked as a professor of [[Sociology]] at the [[University of Konstanz]] in [[Germany]] from 1970 to his retirement,<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Adam|first1=F|last2=Čas|first2=B|date=2004|title=Utemeljitev za imenovanje dr.

== Work  ==
'''<big>Early Work</big>'''

Luckmann worked as a chauffeur and his, Benita, worked as a typist when they first moved to New York. During this time he continued studying sociology and philosophy at the New School for Research. It was there where he first met some of the great influences of his life, including Peter L. Berger. <ref>Stegmaier, Peter & vom Lehn, Dirk. (2016). Thomas Luckmann dies aged 88. 10.13140/RG.2.1.4175.5762. </ref>

=== Philosophy and Social Thought ===
Luckmann was a follower of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologically]] oriented school of [[sociology]], established by the Austrian-American scholar [[Alfred Schütz]]. He contributed to the foundation of phenomenological sociology, the sociology of religion in modern societies, and the sociology of knowledge and communication.<ref name=":0" /> The interdisciplinary nature of his work remains relevant in sociology and other disciplines today.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sica |first1=Alan |title=Social Construction as Fantasy: Reconsidering Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann's The Social Construction of Reality after 50 Years |journal=Cultural Sociology |date=March 2016 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=37–52 |doi=10.1177/1749975515614869 |s2cid=147527965 }}</ref>

==== Social Constructionism ====
In several of his works, he developed the theory of [[social constructionism]], which argues that all knowledge, including the most basic common sense knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by social interactions. Together with [[Peter L. Berger]], he wrote the book ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' in 1966. The book was an important part of the move in sociology, and particularly the sociology of religion, away from the view of religion and religious values as central to [[Social order|the social order]], arguing that social order is socially constructed by individuals and/or groups of individuals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of global religion|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Juergensmeyer, Mark., Roof, Wade Clark.|isbn=9781452266565|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=767737455}}</ref> Since publication, the book has been translated into thirteen different languages and serves as a cornerstone in sociological literature.<ref name=":6" />  Berger wrote on their experience writing the book saying "someone asked, Why did not The Social Construction of Reality immediately have a huge effect? The effect came much later, and my answer was that you cannot play chamber music at a rock concert. And compared to what was going on all around us in the social sciences, we were doing chamber music."<ref>Vera, H. (2016). An Interview with Peter L. Berger: Chamber Music at a Rock Concert. ''Cultural Sociology'', ''10''(1), 21–29. <nowiki>https://doi-org.holycross.idm.oclc.org/10.1177/1749975515616825</nowiki></ref>

==== Sociology of Religion ====
Following his field work in Germany and the completion of his dissertation, Luckmann was asked to complete several reviews on the surrounding sociological literature concerning religion. Disappointed by the positivistic, unauthentic views of a Church-backed sociology of religion, Luckmann was compelled to write ''The Invisible Religion'' in 1963.<ref name=":6"/> The book was then translated into English in 1967. Luckmann proposes that there are four derivative types of religion the first of those being a "is a universal and nonspecific elementary social form which is an objective total worldview providing social meaning for a society's existence."<ref>Weigert, A. J. (1974). Whose Invisible Religion? Luckmann Revisited. Sociological Analysis, 35(3), 181–188. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.2307/3710648</nowiki></ref>  The second, "the specific institutional social form of religion constituted by configurations of religious representations form- ing a sacred cosmos which is part of the worldview."<ref>Weigert, A. J. (1974). Whose Invisible Religion? Luckmann Revisited. Sociological Analysis, 35(3), 181–188. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.2307/3710648</nowiki></ref> The third, "a universal nonspecific form of individual religiosity which is an internalized subjective system of relevance reflecting the objectivated universal and nonspecific elementary social form of religion."<ref>Weigert, A. J. (1974). Whose Invisible Religion? Luckmann Revisited. Sociological Analysis, 35(3), 181–188. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.2307/3710648</nowiki></ref> Lastly, "a specific biographical form of religiosity in individual consciousness."<ref>Weigert, A. J. (1974). Whose Invisible Religion? Luckmann Revisited. Sociological Analysis, 35(3), 181–188. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.2307/3710648</nowiki></ref>  Drawing from Durkheim, Luckmann developed a functional perspective in his theoretical objectives. Luckmann's theory reiterate's Durkheim's notion that "the original symbol system whereby man emerged from the animal world was religious."<ref>Weigert, A. J. (1974). Whose Invisible Religion? Luckmann Revisited. ''Sociological Analysis'', ''35''(3), 181–188. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.2307/3710648</nowiki></ref> Rather than reverting to popular explanations of secularization, Luckmann explained the emergence of a new kind of religion in the 20th century: private religion<ref name=":5" /> He explains the diffusion of world views and institutional de-specialization of religion led to a privatization, rather than a retreat, from religion.<ref name=":7">{{cite journal |last1=Estruch |first1=Joan |title=A Conversation with Thomas Luckmann |journal=Social Compass |date=December 2008 |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=532–540 |doi=10.1177/0037768608097237 |s2cid=144043334 }}</ref> Though Luckmann initially received harsh criticisms, ''The Invisible Religion'' became a pivotal move within the sociology of religion in the 20th century, especially in conjunction with ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.

==== Sociology of Knowledge and Communication ====
Luckmann’s contribution to the sociology of knowledge and communication is based on his careful analysis of the link between socio-cultural linguistic practices, and the construction of social reality.<ref name=":7" /> Based on his empirical research of conversational analysis, Luckmann explains his theory of “communicative genres” in which linguistic types, such as, gossip, proverbs, or jokes, all serve as forms of social knowledge, and act as tools for the formation of social structure.<ref name=":7" /> His ethnography of speaking, modeled a social interactional code that gave a dissimilar approach to sources of social constraint.<ref name=":7" />


==== Social Action ====
Luckmann continued this analysis of social action, and in 1982 he continued the work of Alfred Schütz, drawing on Schütz's notes and unfinished manuscripts to complete ''Structures of the Life-World'', published (posthumously for Schütz) in 1982.<ref name=":0" /> Luckmann then built upon Schütz's analysis and published, ''Theory of Social Action'' in 1992.<ref name=":0" />

Together with [[Richard Grathoff]] and Walter M. Sprondel, Luckmann founded the Social Science Archive Konstanz (also known as the Alfred Schütz Memorial Archives).<ref name=":0" /> What became the official archive of the [[German Sociological Association]], Luckmann and his colleagues gathered research accounts of German social science.<ref name=":7" />

In 1998 he was awarded an [[List of Honorary Doctors of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology|honorary doctorate from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary Doctors|website=www.ntnu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>

In 2004 Luckmann became an honorary member of the Slovenian Sociological Association.<ref name=":3" /> The [[German Sociological Association]] awarded him a prize for his outstanding lifetime contribution to sociology at its 2002 Congress, and Luckmann became an honorary member in 2016.<ref name=":0" />
