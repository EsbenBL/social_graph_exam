'''Duke University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

The campus spans over {{convert|8600|acre|ha|abbr=off}} on three contiguous sub-campuses in Durham, and a [[Duke University Marine Laboratory|marine lab]] in [[Beaufort, North Carolina|Beaufort]].

Duke is ranked among the top universities in the United States.

=== Beginnings ===
{{Main|History of Duke University}}

[[File:Wdukebuild.jpg|thumb|alt=Early 20th-century black-and-white photo of three-story building|One of the first buildings on the original Durham campus ([[Duke University East Campus|East Campus]]), the Washington Duke Building ("Old Main"), was destroyed by a fire in 1911]]
Duke first opened in 1838 as Brown's Schoolhouse, a private subscription school founded in [[Randolph County, North Carolina|Randolph County]] in the present-day town of [[Trinity, North Carolina|Trinity]].<ref name="chronology">{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/uarchives/history/chronology.html|title=A Chronology of Significant Events in Duke University's History|publisher=Duke University Archives|access-date=May 23, 2011}}</ref> Organized by the Union Institute Society, a group of Methodists and Quakers, Brown's Schoolhouse became the Union Institute Academy in 1841 when North Carolina issued a charter. The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851 and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Church]].<ref name="chronology" /> In 1892, Trinity College moved to Durham, largely due to generosity from [[Julian Carr (industrialist)|Julian S. Carr]] and [[Washington Duke]], powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco and electrical industries.<ref name="king" /> Carr donated land in 1892 for the original Durham campus, which is now known as East Campus. At the same time, Washington Duke gave the school $85,000 for an initial endowment and construction costs—later augmenting his generosity with three separate $100,000 contributions in 1896, 1899, and 1900—with the stipulation that the college "open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111206/depret.html |last=Pyatt |first=Tim |date=November–December 2006 |title=Retrospective: Selections from University Archives |journal=Duke Magazine|publisher=Duke Office of Alumni Affairs |volume=92 |issue=6 |access-date=May 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515204431/http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111206/depret.html |archive-date=May 15, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1924 Washington Duke's son, [[James B. Duke]], established [[The Duke Endowment]] with a $40 million trust fund. Income from the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the [[Methodist Church]], and four colleges (including Trinity College). [[William Preston Few]], the president of Trinity at the time, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the "Trinity" name. At first, James B. Duke thought the name change would come off as self-serving, but eventually, he accepted Few's proposal as a memorial to his father.<ref name="king" /> Money from the endowment allowed the University to grow quickly. Duke's original campus, [[Duke University East Campus|East Campus]], was rebuilt from 1925 to 1927 with [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style buildings. By 1930, the majority of the [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]]-style buildings on the campus one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west were completed, and construction on [[Duke University West Campus|West Campus]] culminated with the completion of Duke Chapel in 1935.<ref name="chapel">

In 1878, Trinity (in Randolph County) awarded A.B. degrees to three sisters—Mary, Persis, and Theresa Giles—who had studied both with private tutors and in classes with men. With the relocation of the college in 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke's donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed "on an equal footing with men" at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members' children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the Board of Trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman's residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke's daughter. By 1904, fifty-four women were enrolled in the college. In 1930, the Woman's College was established as a coordinate to the men's undergraduate college, which had been established and named Trinity College in 1924.<ref name="WashingtonDukeWomen">{{cite web |last = King |first = William, E. |title = Washington Duke and the Education of Women|website = University Archives |publisher = David M.

=== Expansion and growth ===
[[Engineering]], which had been taught at Duke since 1903, became a [[Pratt School of Engineering|separate school]] in 1939. The university president's official residence, the [[J. Deryl Hart House]], was completed in 1934. In athletics, Duke hosted and competed in the first [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] ever played outside California in [[Wallace Wade Stadium]] in 1942; the second such game was played in [[Arlington, Texas]], in 2021, moved as a result of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="chronology"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Witz |first1=Billy |title=In Pasadena, Moving the Rose Bowl Makes For Unusual Rancor |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/sports/ncaafootball/rose-bowl-move-pasadena.html |access-date=May 11, 2021 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 1, 2021}}</ref> During World War II, Duke was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a navy commission.<ref name="duke-v-12">{{cite web|url=http://archives.mc.duke.edu/taxonomy/term/794 |title=Navy V-12 Program |publisher=[[Durham, North Carolina]]: Duke University |access-date=September 28, 2011 |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305105215/http://archives.mc.duke.edu/taxonomy/term/794 |archive-date=March 5, 2011 }}</ref> In 1963 the Board of Trustees officially [[desegregation|desegregated]] the undergraduate college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanrights.fhi.duke.edu/who-we-are/history-of-human-rights-at-duke/slavery-and-segregation/ |title=Slavery and Segregation |publisher=Duke Human Rights Center|author=Marianne Twu|date=2010 |access-date=January 8, 2016}}</ref>

Increased activism on campus during the 1960s prompted [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] to speak at the University in November 1964 on the progress of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Following [[Douglas Knight]]'s resignation from the office of university president, [[Terry Sanford]], the former governor of North Carolina, was elected president of the university in 1969, propelling The [[Fuqua School of Business]]' opening, the William R. Perkins library completion, and the founding of the [[Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy|Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs]] (now the Sanford School of Public Policy). The separate Woman's College merged back with Trinity as the liberal arts college for both men and women in 1972.

Beginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke's reputation both nationally and internationally. Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting minority faculty and students. During this time it also became the birthplace of the first Physician Assistant degree program in the United States.<ref>

In 2019, Duke paid $112.5 Million to settle False Claims Act allegations related to scientific research misconduct. A researcher at the school was falsifying or fabricating research data, in order to win grants for financial gain.
