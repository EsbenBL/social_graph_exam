==Why Social Preferences Matter==
In his 2002 collaboration with [[Urs Fischbacher]], ''Why Social Preferences Matter – The Impact of Non-Selfish Motives on Competition, Cooperation and Incentives'', he begins with the abstract:

<blockquote>A substantial number of people exhibit social preferences, which means they are not solely motivated by material self-interest but also care positively or negatively for the material payoffs of relevant reference agents.  We show empirically that economists can fail to understand fundamental economic questions when they disregard social preferences, in particular, that without taking social preferences into account, it is not possible to understand adequately (i) effects of competition on market outcomes, (ii) laws governing cooperation and collective action, (iii) effects and the determinants of material incentives, (iv) which contracts and property rights arrangements are optimal, and (v) important forces shaping social norms and market failures.</blockquote>

He conjectures that we could call economics "[[the dismal science]]" because it consistently assumes the worst in human motives, which contrasts sharply with the pervasive idea that consumer tastes are heterogeneous.  He attacks the idea on two fronts.  First, because a great amount of evidence has contradicted the selfishness hypothesis; second, because failure to regard other-concerning behavior ignores central market activities.<ref>''The Economic Journal'', "Why Social Preferences Matter – The Impact of Non-Selfish Motives on Competition, Cooperation and Incentives" (Blackwell Publishers, Oxford and Malden, 2002) Vol. 112, No. 489 C1–C33</ref>
