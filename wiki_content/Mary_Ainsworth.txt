==Life==
Mary Dinsmore Salter was born in [[Glendale, Ohio|Glendale]], [[Ohio]] on December 1, 1913, the eldest of three daughters born to Mary and Charles Salter. Her father, who possessed a master's degree in history, worked at a manufacturing firm in [[Cincinnati]] and her mother was a nurse. Both her parents were graduates of [[Dickinson College]] who placed "high value on a good liberal arts education" and expected their children to have excellent academic achievements.<ref name="psychology.sunysb.edu">{{cite book|editor1=O’Connell, A.N. |editor2=Russo, N.F. |title=Models Of Achievement: Reflections Of Eminent Women In Psychology|date=1983|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=200–219|chapter-url=http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/pdf/mda_autobio.pdf|chapter=Mary D. Salter Ainsworth}}</ref> In 1918, her father's manufacturing firm transferred him and the family moved to [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, where Salter would spend the rest of her childhood.

Salter was a precocious child who thirsted for knowledge. She began reading by the age of three, and the family would once a week visit the local library where her mother would select appropriate books for her level.<ref name="psychology.sunysb.edu"/> She was close with her father, who assumed the duties of tucking her in at night and singing to her, but did not have a warm relationship with her mother; Salter later stated that their relationship was marked by her mother's jealousy and interference with the bond she had with her father.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Study Guide for Psychologists and Their Theories for Students: MARY SALTER AINSWORTH|author=Gale|asin=B013EU4PSK|date=2015|page=7}}</ref> Salter excelled in school, and decided to become a psychologist after reading [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]'s book ''Character and the Conduct of Life'' (1926) at the age of 15.<ref name="psychology.sunysb.edu"/>

She began classes at the [[University of Toronto]] at the age of 16, where she was one of only five students to be admitted into the honors course in psychology. She completed coursework for her bachelor's degree in 1935, and decided to continue her education at the University of Toronto with the intention of earning her doctorate in psychology. She earned her master's degree in 1936 and her PhD was granted in 1939.<ref name="www2.webster.edu"/><ref name="NYT"/> Salter's dissertation was titled "An Evaluation of Adjustment Based on the Concept of Security". Her dissertation stated that "where family security is lacking, the individual is handicapped by the lack of a secure base from which to work."<ref>Salter, 1940, p.45</ref>

After graduation, Salter stayed on at the University of Toronto as a teacher before joining the [[Canadian Women's Army Corps]] in 1942.<ref name="www2.webster.edu"/> While with the army, Salter began as an Army Examiner who interviewed and selected personnel in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. Her duties included administering clinical evaluations and personnel assessment tests. Soon she was promoted as an Advisor to the Director of Personnel Selection of the Canadian Women's Army Corps, and reached the rank of [[Major]] in 1945.<ref name="Psychologists and Their Theories for Students"/><ref name="psychology.sunysb.edu"/>

After victory in the war, Salter returned to Toronto to continue teaching [[personality psychology]], conducted research, and worked with Klopfer on a revision of the Rorschach.<ref>Klopfer, B., Ainsworth,

After many other academic positions, including a long tenure at [[Johns Hopkins University]], she eventually settled at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1975, where she remained for the rest of her academic career until 1984. From then she became a professor emeritus and stayed active until the year of 1992.<ref name="NYT"/> While working at Johns Hopkins, Ainsworth did not receive the proper treatment considering her skills and expertise, such as a proper salary she deserved considering her age, experience, and contribution to the job.<ref name="www2.webster.edu"/><ref name="NYT"/> She had to wait two years for an associate professor position even though her qualifications surpassed the job description.<ref name="www2.webster.edu"/><ref name="NYT"/> At the time, women had to eat in separate dining rooms than men, which ultimately meant women could not meet male head department members the "normal way".<ref name="Psychologists and Their Theories for Students"/>

==Early work==
During graduate school, Mary studied under the mentorship of [[William E. Blatz]]. Blatz focused on studying what he referred to as "security theory." This theory outlined Blatz's idea that different levels of dependence on parents meant different qualities of relationships with those parents, as well as the quality of relationships with future partners. His tiers of dependence were labeled secure dependence, independent security, immature dependent security, and mature secure dependence. Blatz theorized that the more secure and mature that the interaction was between individuals, the more likely the relationship to be healthy and without insecurities.

After leaving the Canadian Women's corps she returned to Toronto to continue teaching personality psychology and conduct research. She married Leonard Ainsworth in 1950 and moved to London with him to allow him to finish his graduate degree at University College. While in England, Ainsworth joined the research team of [[John Bowlby]] at the [[Tavistock Clinic]], investigating the effects of maternal separation on child development. Comparison of disrupted mother-child bonds to normal mother-child relationship showed that a child's lack of a mother figure lead to "adverse development effects."<ref name="kendracherry"/>

In 1954, she left the Tavistock Clinic to do research in Africa where she carried out her longitudinal field study of mother-infant interaction. She chose to examine a common weaning practice in the area, in which the child is sent away for several days to live with relatives and "forget the breast." Ainsworth conducted detailed interviews with families from 6 villages surrounding Kampala, Uganda, but was originally met with a language barrier. In order to overcome this, she made a great effort to learn the language to the extent that she could carry out simple conversation. Through learning this, she developed an appreciation for the culture, and later said, "It is a pity that one cannot require field work in another society of every aspiring investigator of child development."<ref name=" Bretherton">Bretherton, I. (2003). Mary Ainsworth: Insightful observer and courageous theoretician.  Portraits of pioneers in psychology, 5, 317-331.</ref> Ainsworth's book from that field study, ''Infancy in Uganda'', remains an exceptional and classic ethological study in the development of attachment and demonstrates that the process reflects specific universal characteristics that cross linguistic, cultural and geographic lines.

Mary Ainsworth followed her husband when a position as a forensic psychologist brought him to Baltimore.<ref name="Bretherton" /> She spoke on clinical psychology at The Johns Hopkins University. In 1958, she was given a permanent position as an associate professor of developmental psychology. During this time at Johns Hopkins, Ainsworth's professional relationship with John Bowlby grew. While he had previously been a mentor, they started working together as equal partners, exchanging paper drafts for comments and finding the time to meet on rare occasions, since he was still primarily in London. Bowlby gave Ainsworth a copy of his new paper "The Nature of the Child’s Tie to His Mother" for her comments and Ainsworth was able to provide Bowlby information on her studies of infant-mother attachment in Uganda.<ref name="Bretherton" />

Ainsworth underwent a difficult divorce in 1960, but continued with her research. She had an opportunity to present the findings from her Uganda study at a Tavistock Mother-Infant Interaction Study Group in London.<ref name="Bretherton" /> It was her first time publicly presenting results, and the reactions were not enthusiastic. The primary question that developmental psychologists brought up was her definition for "attachment." Ainsworth was motivated by this and other questions to create a catalogue of behaviors like "crying when the mother left the room, following her, greeting her on return with smiling, vocalization, excited bouncing, reaching or approach behavior" that she could use to qualify attachment.<ref name="Bretherton" />

==Strange Situation==
{{Details|Strange situation}}

In 1965, Ainsworth designed the Strange Situation Procedure as a way of assessing individual differences in attachment behaviour by evoking individual's reaction when encountering stress. The Strange Situation Procedure is divided into eight episodes, lasting for three minutes each.<ref>Davidson, J. (Director), & Davidson, F. (Producer). (2005). Mary Ainsworth: Attachment and the Growth of Love [Video file]. Davidson Films, Inc. Retrieved October 20, 2014, from Education in Video: Volume I.</ref> In the first episode, the infant and his or her caregiver enter into a pleasant laboratory setting, with many toys. After one minute, a person unknown to the infant enters the room and slowly tries to make acquaintance. The caregiver leaves the child with the stranger for three minutes; and then returns. The caregiver departs for a second time, leaving the child alone for three minutes; it is then the stranger who enters, and offers to comfort the infant. Finally, the caregiver returns, and is instructed to pick up the child. As the episodes increase the stress of the infant by increments, the observer can watch the infant's movement between behavioural systems: the interplay of exploration and attachment behaviour, in the presence and in the absence of the parent.<ref>Bretherton, I., & Ainsworth, M. D. S. (1974). "One-year-olds in the Strange Situation." In M. Lewis & L. Rosenblum (Eds.), ''The Origins of Fear'' (pp. 134- 164), New York: Wiley.</ref>

On the basis of their behaviors, the 26 children in Ainsworth's original Baltimore study were placed into one of three classifications. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver, and implies different forms of communication, emotion regulation, and ways of responding to perceived threats.

Despite the many findings from her Strange Situation experiment, there was also criticism. It was said to have too much emphasis on the mother and did not measure a general attachment style. It was said that Ainsworth's work was biased because the study was conducted with only [[American middle class|middle class American]] families. Critics also believed the experiment was artificial and lacked ecological validity.

===Anxious-Avoidant Insecure Attachment ===
A child with the anxious-avoidant insecure attachment style will avoid or ignore the caregiver – showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The child will not explore very much regardless of who is there. There is not much emotional range regardless of who is in the room or if it is empty. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell (1970) theorised that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants is in fact as a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.<ref>Sroufe, A. & Waters, E. (1977) Attachment as an Organizational Construct. Child Development, 48: 1184-1199</ref>

===Secure Attachment ===
A child who's securely attached to its mother will explore freely while the caregiver is present, using her as a 'safe base' from which to explore. The child will engage with the stranger when the caregiver is present, and will be visibly upset when the caregiver departs but happy to see the caregiver on his or her return. In the United States, about seventy percent of middle-class babies present secure attachment in this study.<ref>A sensitive mother creates a secure attachment : Mary Ainsworth (1913-1999). (2012). In Big ideas simply explained: The psychology book.</ref><ref>Sroufe, L. A., & Waters, E. (1977). Attachment as an organizational construct. Child Development, 48, 1184-1199.</ref>

===Anxious-Resistant Insecure Attachment===
Children classified as Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant (C) showed distress even before separation, and were clingy and difficult to comfort on the caregiver's return. They either showed signs of resentment in response to the absence (C1 subtype), or signs of helpless passivity (C2 subtype). In Ainsworth's original sample, all six C infants showed so much distress in the course of the episodes of the Strange Situation Procedure 'that observations had to be discontinued.'<ref>Ainsworth, M.D., Blehar, M, Waters, E, & Wall, S. (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, p. 167</ref> One percent of infants had responded with high degree of passivity and inactivity in a situation of helpless settings.<ref>Carlson, V., Cicchetti, D., Barnett, D., Braunwald, K. (1989) Developmental Psychology, 25, p. 525-531</ref>

===Disorganized/Disoriented Attachment===
A fourth category was added by Ainsworth's colleague [[Mary Main]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Mary |last1=Main |first2=Judith |last2=Solomon |year=1990 |chapter=Procedures for Identifying Infants as Disorganized/Disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHIfiCXE8EC&pg=PA121 |pages=121–60 |editor1-first=Mark T. |editor1-last=Greenberg |editor2-first=Dante |editor2-last=Cicchetti |editor3-first=E. Mark |editor3-last=Cummings |title=Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-30630-8}}</ref> In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as 'open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished', as she worried that the D classification might be too encompassing and might subsume too many different forms of behaviour<ref>Ainsworth, M. (1990). 'Epilogue' in Attachment in the Preschool Years, ed. M.T. Greenberg, D. Ciccheti & E.M. Cummings. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, pp.463-488.</ref>  In contrast to infants in other categories classified by Mary Ainsworth, which possess a standard path of reaction while dealing with the stress of separation and reunion, type D infants appeared to possess no symptom of coping mechanism. In fact, these infants had mixed features such as "strong proximity seeking followed by strong avoidance or appeared dazed and disoriented upon reunion with their caretakers (or both)."<ref>Hertsgaard, L., Gunnar, M., Erickson, Martha, F. ; Nachmias, Melissa.(1995). Child Development[Peer Reviewed Journal],(4), p.1100(7)</ref>

From Project STEEP, infants that were having Disorganized/Disoriented (Type D) tested of secreting higher cortisol concentrations in saliva than infants in the traditional (ABC) classifications. Results of this study demonstrate a model of stress reactivity that reflects how the various classification of traditional (ABC) behaviors become a factor that is affecting physiological stress responses.<ref>Hertsgaard (1995) Child Development[Peer Reviewed Journal], p.1100-06</ref>
