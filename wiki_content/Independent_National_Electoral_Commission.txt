==History==

=== Regulation and administration of elections ===
The administration of democratic elections in Nigeria dates back to the period before Independence when the Electoral Commission of Nigeria(ECN) was inaugurated in 1958 to conduct the 1959  federal elections. Prior to 1958, regional laws and government regulated and conducted elections.<ref name="INEC History – INEC Nigeria">{{Cite web|title=INEC History – INEC Nigeria|url=https://www.inecnigeria.org/home/inec-history/|website=www.inecnigeria.org|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965355951|title=Myths of peace & democracy? : towards building pillars of hope, unity and transformation in Africa|others=Marongwe, Ngonidzashe, Mawere, Munyaradzi.|isbn=978-9956-764-60-0|location=Mankon, Bamenda, Cameroon|pages=128–131|oclc=965355951}}</ref> ECN was headed by an expatriate, [[Ronald Wraith|Ronald Edward Wraith]] and four Nigerian members representing each region and the Federal Capital Territory of Lagos. The Federal Electoral Commission (FEC), established in 1960 conducted the immediate post-independence federal and regional elections of 1964 and 1965. Prior to the conduct of the 1964 election, the Chief Electoral Officer, Kofo Abayomi resigned and some party officials from the NCNC and Action Group doubted the credibility of a free and fair election.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alao|first=Akin|date=2001-10-01|title=The Republican Constitution of 1963: The Supreme Court and Federalism in Nigeria|url=https://repository.law.miami.edu/umiclr/vol10/iss2/10|journal=University of Miami International and Comparative Law Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=91}}</ref> The electoral body was dissolved after the military coup of 1966. In 1978, the Federal Electoral Commission(FEDECO) was constituted by the regime of General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], organizing the elections of 1979 which ushered in the [[Nigerian Second Republic]] under the leadership of Alhaji [[Shehu Shagari]].  It also conducted the general elections of 1983.<ref name="self">{{cite web

In December 1995, the military government of General [[Sani Abacha]] established the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria which conducted another set of elections. These elected institutions were not inaugurated before the sudden death of General Abacha on June 1998 aborted the process. In 1998, General [[Abdulsalam Abubakar]]'s Administration dissolved NECON and established the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).<ref name="INEC History – INEC Nigeria"/> INEC organized the transitional elections that ushered in the [[Nigerian Fourth Republic]] on May 29, 1999.<ref name=self/>

In January 2015, the "[[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping|#BringBackOurGirls]] group raised the alarm over plans by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to exclude [[Chibok]] and some communities currently under the control of the [[Boko Haram]] from getting the permanent voter cards (PVCs) for the [[2015 Nigerian general election|February elections]]."<ref>{{Cite web

==== Leadership ====
The Chairman of the first Nigerian Federal Electoral Commission was Chief [[Eyo Esua]] (1964–1966) in the [[Nigerian First Republic|First Republic]]. When General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] prepared for a return to civilian power in the [[Nigerian Second Republic|Second Republic]], he established a new Federal Electoral Commission headed by Chief [[Michael Ani]] to supervise the 1979 elections. Ani was succeeded by Justice [[Victor Ovie Whisky]].
During the [[Ibrahim Babangida]] and [[Sani Abacha]] regimes, which attempted returns to democracy, the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria was headed by Professor [[Eme Awa]] (1987–1989), Professor [[Humphrey Nwosu]] (1989–1993), Professor [[Okon Uya]] and Chief [[Sumner Dagogo-Jack]] (1994–1998).<ref>{{cite web

== INEC ==
General [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]] established the current INEC, with Justice [[Ephraim Akpata]] as chairman.
Akpata had to deal with 26 political associations, giving only nine provisional registration as political parties for the 1998/1999 elections, eventually whittled down to three parties.<ref>{{cite web

Guobadia was responsible for the 2003 elections, which were marred by widespread violence and other irregularities.<ref>{{cite web

In June 2005, Guobadia retired and was succeeded by Professor [[Maurice Iwu]]. Soon after being appointed, Iwu announced that foreign monitors would not be allowed during elections, but only foreign election observers. This decision was condemned by politicians and civil society groups who called for his immediate removal from office.<ref>{{cite web

On 8 June 2010, Professor [[Attahiru Muhammadu Jega]] was nominated by President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] as the new INEC Chairman, subject to Senate confirmation, as a replacement for Iwu, who had vacated the post on 28 April 2010.<ref name=dtrust599>{{cite web

The Senate President [[David Mark]], Speaker of the House of Representatives [[Oladimeji Bankole]], and most of the state Governors also attended the meeting.
Unanimous approval by the council of the nominee for this critical appointment avoided controversy about whether or not the President should appoint the chairman of the INEC.<ref>{{cite web

Attahiru Jega's five-year term came to an end on June 30, 2015, and though he was qualified for re-appointment, the chances of such became remote given the allegations of bias against him by campaign officials of President Goodluck.<ref>{{cite web

==Controversies==
The INEC has encountered several controversies in the run-up to elections in the country, most notably the [[2007 Nigerian general election|April 2007 general elections]], including criticism about its preparedness from [[Sada Abubakar]], [[List of Sultans of Sokoto|Sultan of Sokoto]]<ref name=angop>{{cite web|url= http://www.angolapress-angop.ao/noticia-e.asp?ID=517493|title= Sultan slams Nigeria's election preparations|access-date= 2007-03-19|date= 2007-03-17|work= Angola Press website|publisher= Angola Press Agency|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133625/http://www.angolapress-angop.ao/noticia-e.asp?ID=517493|archive-date= 2007-09-29}}</ref>

On the subject of election irregularities, INEC spokesman Philip Umeadi said on April 19 that "We are not sitting on any crisis in Nigeria.".<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |first= Lydia|last=Polgreen|author-link=Lydia Polgreen |title= Nigeria Frets Over How to Give Voters a Real Say|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|page= A3|date= 2007-04-20|access-date= 2007-04-20|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/world/africa/20nigeria.html}}</ref>
The mission of INEC is to serve as an independent and effective EMB committed to the conduct of free, fair and credible elections for sustainable democracy in Nigeria. The vision of INEC is to be one of the best Election Management Bodies (EMB) in the world that meets the aspirations of the Nigerian people.

In the buildup to 2015 general elections, INEC under Jega introduced smart card reader for the verification of voters and their voting cards to minimize incidence of fraud and rigging.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guardian.ng/politics/questions-and-answers-on-card-readers/|title=Questions And Answers On Card Readers|website=guardian.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The introduction of card readers was hailed by many Nigerians but a group of four minor political parties who claimed to be acting on behalf of 15 political parties kicked against it and urged INEC to suspend the use of card reader in the 2015 elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://silverbirdtv.com/uncategorized/18312/4-political-parties-want-jega-fired-threaten-to-boycott-elections-over-card-readers/|title=4 Political Parties Want Jega Fired; Threaten To Boycott Elections Over Card Readers|date=2015-03-05|website=SilverbirdTV|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The 2015 general elections were adjudged the most credible, free and fair election since the return of democracy in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecable.ng/pvc-card-reader-orubebe-four-things-defined-jegas-time-inec|title=Jega|date=2015-06-30|website=TheCable|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailypost.ng/2015/06/21/the-use-of-card-readers-in-elections-has-come-to-stay-jega/|title=The use of card readers in elections has come to stay – Jega|last=Ugwuanyi|first=Sylvester|date=2015-06-21|website=Daily Post Nigeria|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>

INEC was accused of widespread electoral irregularities in the 2019 presidential elections including cases of ballot paper unavailability, smart card readers malfunctioning and large cancellation of valid votes. The main opposition People's Democratic Party and its presidential candidate challenged the results of the election in court.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thisday Newspapers |title=NBA Accuses INEC Officials of Aiding Election Rigging |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/02/27/nba-accuses-inec-officials-of-aiding-election-rigging/ |website=Thisdaylive}}</ref>
