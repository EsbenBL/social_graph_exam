==Views==
Fair has published several articles defending the use of [[drone strikes in Pakistan]] and has been critical of analyses by [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], and other humanitarian organizations, arguing that drone strikes are accurate, have reduced casualties, have targeted Taliban leadership, and are popular among some Pakistanis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/06/ethical-and-methodological-issues-in-assessing-drones-civilian-impacts-in-pakistan/|title=Ethical and methodological issues in assessing drones' civilian impacts in Pakistan|last=Fair|first=C.

== Academic controversies ==
Fair's work and viewpoints have been the subject of criticism.<ref name="Salon">{{Cite news|last=Norton |first=Ben |date=November 4, 2015 |title=Not playing fair: How Christine Fair, defender of U.S. drone program in Pakistan, twists the facts — and may have conflicts of her own |url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/04/i_am_a_rambo_bch_meet_the_drone_defender_who_hates_neo_cons_attacks_glenn_greenwald_and_may_have_conflicts_of_her_own/ |website=Salon |access-date=November 4, 2015 }}</ref>  In 2015, journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] dismissed Fair's arguments in support of drone strikes as "rank propaganda", arguing there are "enormous amounts of evidence" showing drones are counterproductive, pointing to mass civilian casualties and independent studies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2015/10/drone-strikes-create-terrorists-kill-151023152321140.html|title=Do drone strikes create more terrorists than they kill?|work=Al Jazeera|date=October 23, 2015|access-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref>  Commenting on her debate with Greenwald,  [[Brookings Institution]] senior fellow Shadi Hamid called Fair's arguments "surprisingly weak".<ref name="Salon"/>  In 2010, Fair denied the notion that drones caused any civilian deaths, alleging Pakistani media reports were responsible for creating this perception.<ref name="Scahill">{{cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/georgetown-professor-drones-are-not-killing-innocent-civilians-pakistan/|title=Georgetown Professor: 'Drones Are Not Killing Innocent Civilians' in Pakistan|work=The Nation|date=May 10, 2010|access-date=September 6, 2016|first=Jeremy|last=Scahill}}</ref> [[Jeremy Scahill]] wrote that Fair's statement was "simply false" and contradicted by [[New America (organization)|New America]]'s detailed study on drone casualties.<ref name="Scahill"/> Fair later said that casualties are caused by the UAVs, but maintains they are the most effective tool for fighting terrorism.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/world/asia/12drones.html?_r=0|title=C.I.A.

Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Conor Friedersdorf]] challenged Fair's co-authored narrative that the U.S. could legitimize support in Pakistan for its drone program using 'education' and 'public diplomacy'; he called it an "example of interventionist hubris and naivete" built upon flawed interpretation of public opinion data.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/01/yes-pakistanis-really-do-hate-americas-killer-drones/272468|title=Yes, Pakistanis Really Do Hate America's Killer Drones|work=The Atlantic|date=January 24, 2013|access-date=September 6, 2016|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf}}</ref> An article in the [[Middle East Research and Information Project]] called the work "some of the most propagandistic writing in support of President [[Barack Obama]]’s targeted kill lists to date."<ref name="Waheed">{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/drones-us-propaganda-imperial-hubris|title=Drones, US Propaganda and Imperial Hubris|work=Middle East Research and Information Project|first=Sarah|last=Waheed|date=January 25, 2013|access-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref> It censured the view that Pakistanis needed to be informed by the U.S. what is "good for them" as fraught with imperialist condescension; or the assumption that the [[Urdu]] press was less informed than the English press – because the latter was sometimes less critical of the U.S.<ref name="Waheed"/>

Fair's journalistic sources have been questioned for their credibility<ref name="Ahmad">{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/06/2011613931606455.html|title=The magical realism of body counts|work=Al Jazeera|date=June 14, 2011|access-date=September 6, 2016|first=Muhammad Idrees|last=Ahmad}}</ref> and she has been accused of having a [[conflict of interest]] due to her past work with U.S. government think tanks, as well as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].<ref name="Salon"/> In 2011 and 2012, she received funding from the [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|U.S. embassy in Islamabad]] to conduct a survey on public opinion concerning militancy. However, Fair states most of the grants went to a survey firm and that it had no influence on her research.<ref name="Salon"/> [[Pakistani media]] analysts have dismissed Fair's views as hawkish rhetoric, riddled with factual inaccuracies, lack of objectivity, and being selectively biased.<ref name="Ahmad"/><ref name="Haider">{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/729946/an-unfair-comment|title=An unFair comment|work=Dawn|first=Murtaza|last=Haider|date=June 27, 2012|access-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name="TN">{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/96617-US-professors-anti-Pak-agenda|title=US professor's anti-Pak agenda?|work=The News|date=February 7, 2016|access-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Prejudice Dominates Christine Discourse|work=[[Islamabad Policy Research Institute]]|first=Khalid|last=Chandio|date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>  She has also been rebuked{{by whom|date=March 2019}} for comments on social media perceived as provocative, such as suggesting burning down Pakistan's embassy in Afghanistan or asking India to "squash Pakistan militarily, diplomatically, politically and economically."{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} She has been accused of double standards, partisanship towards [[India]], and has been criticized for her contacts with dissident leaders from [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], a link which they claim "raises serious questions if her interest in Pakistan is merely academic."<ref name="TN"/>

== Personal controversies ==
In January 2017, Fair was involved in a [[Twitter]] dispute with [[Asra Nomani|Asra Q. Nomani]]. In response to Nomani's tweet that as a [[Muslims|Muslim]], she voted for [[Donald Trump|President Trump]], Fair tweeted that she had "written [Nomani] off as a human being" and that Nomani had "pimped herself out to all media outlets." Nomani responded by filing a complaint with Georgetown University, Fair's employer, alleging discrimination and harassment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/01/06/muslim-woman-who-voted-for-trump-asks-georgetown-to-intervene-over-professors-hateful-vulgar-messages/|title=Muslim woman who voted for Trump asks Georgetown to intervene over professor's 'hateful, vulgar' messages|last=Moyer|first=Justin Wm.|date=January 6, 2017|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref>

In May 2017, Fair began an altercation with white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] at a gym in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. While the two were working out, Fair approached Spencer and accused him of being a [[Nazism|Nazi]], along with a number of other accusations, leading a third gym patron to intervene on behalf of him. This incident resulted in Spencer's membership being terminated by the manager of the gym.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/richard_spencer_gym_professor.html#incart_most-comments|title=Professor confronts white nationalist at the gym - which terminates his membership|date=May 21, 2017|work=[[The Times-Picayune|Nola.com]]|access-date=September 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306000842/https://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/richard_spencer_gym_professor.html|archive-date=March 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2018, Fair was involved in an incident at [[Frankfurt Airport]]. When her bag was flagged for possibly containing explosives, it was searched and [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] instructed Fair that she would have to dispose of a liquid [[deodorant]] or transfer it to her checked bag. German police stated that Fair was uncooperative, as she accused them of sexism and of being Nazis and thugs, and directed expletives at them. Fair was charged with slander under Germany's [[defamation]] law. She subsequently published an article on ''[[HuffPost]]'' partially rejecting the police account of the incident.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article196872084.html|title=U.S. professor sued for calling a German cop a Nazi claims 'extraordinary corruption'|last=Londberg|first=Max|date=January 26, 2018|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|access-date=September 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215043305/https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article196872084.html|archive-date=February 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the midst of the [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings]] in September 2018, Fair tweeted that [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] were "entitled white men justifying a serial rapists' arrogated entitlement" and that they "deserve miserable deaths while [[Feminism|feminists]] laugh as they take their last gasps." She made additional comments expressing support for post-mortem [[castration]] and corpse desecration of the senators.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11369|title=Georgetown prof: White GOP senators in Kavanaugh hearing 'deserve miserable deaths'|last=Marone|first=Abigail|date=September 30, 2018|work=[[Campus Reform]]|access-date=September 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930234421/https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11369|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> At least one student expressed the fear that Fair's comments would cause students who hold opposing views to feel threatened.
