The school is co-educational and enrolls over 35,000 undergraduate and over 6,000 post-graduate students. The school has approximately 7,000 international students from 150 countries, accounting for 17 per cent of the student population.<ref name="University of Ottawa"/>  The university has a network of more than 195,000 alumni. The university's athletic teams are known as the [[Ottawa Gee-Gees|Gee-Gees]] and are members of [[U Sports]].

==History==
The university was established on 26 September 1848 as the College of Bytown by the first Roman Catholic bishop of Ottawa, [[Joseph-Bruno Guigues]]. He entrusted administration to the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Missionary Oblates of h Mary Immaculate: a clerical religious congregation with brothers|publisher=Saint Paul University|last=Woestman|first=William H.|year=1995|page=297|isbn=0-9192-6137-X}}</ref> The college was originally located in [[Lower Town]], housed in a wooden building next to the [[Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica, Ottawa|Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica]]. However, space quickly became an issue for administrators, triggering two moves in 1852 and a final move to Sandy Hill in 1856.<ref name=tarbs>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabaret.uottawa.ca/article_e_275.html|title=Childhood Friends|work=Tabaret: The magazine of the University of Ottawa|last=Prévost|first=Michel|year=2005|access-date=6 June 2012}}</ref> The Sandy Hill property was donated by [[Louis-Theodore Besserer]], where he offered a substantial parcel from his estate for the college.<ref name=citot /> The college was renamed College of Ottawa in 1861, following the city's name change from [[Bytown]] to [[Ottawa]]. In 1866, the college received its first charter, as well as university status, making it the final institution in [[Canada]] to receive a [[Royal Charter]] from London before the [[British North America Acts|British North America Act, 1867]] made education a provincial responsibility.<ref name=hist /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/university-of-ottawa|title=University of Ottawa|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=The Historica Dominion Institute|year=2012|last=Beaton|first=B.}}</ref> By 1872 the university had already begun to confer undergraduate degrees, with master's degrees coming in 1875 and doctoral degrees in 1888.<ref name=hist /> On 5 February 1889, the university was granted a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII, elevating the university to a pontifical university.<ref name=pontch />

The university faced a crisis when fire destroyed the main building on 2 December 1903. After the fire, the university hired New York architect [[Albert Olszewski Von Herbulis|A. O. Von Herbulis]] to design its replacement, Tabaret Hall. It was among the first Canadian structures to be completely fireproof, built of reinforced concrete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabaret.uottawa.ca/article_e_220.html|title=1994: Prime Minister Honoured|work=Tabaret|last=Prévost|first=Michel|year=2004|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=15 June 2012}}</ref> Women first enrolled in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web5.uottawa.ca/mcs-smc/since1848/timeline/timeline.php|title=Timeline|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=15 June 2012}}</ref>

In total 1,158 students and alumni of the university enrolled the [[Canadian Forces]] during the Second World War, of which 50 died overseas.<ref name=wwii /> The unit was eventually disbanded during the unification of the Armed Forces in 1968.<ref name=wwiifonds/>

The Ottawa architecture firm of Burgess, McLean & MacPhadyen designed the Eastern Ontario Institute of Technology (later to merge with the Ontario Vocational Centre and renamed [[Algonquin College]]), opened its new Rideau Campus on a 12-acre city owned Lees Avenue site in 1964. After being unused for a number of years, the midcentury academic complex was sold to the University of Ottawa in January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1dMxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EuUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4637,197554|title=Ottawa Citizen - Google News Archive Search}}</ref>

The university was reorganized on 1 July 1965 as a corporation independent from any outside body or religious organization, becoming publicly funded. As a result, the civil and pontifical charters were transferred to the newly created Saint Paul University, federated with the corporation, while the remaining civil faculties were retained by the reorganized university.<ref name=hist />

The property now houses the university's department of Visual Arts. It is located at the corner of Laurier Avenue and Cumberland Street, near the Rideau Canal.

In 1974, a new policy mandated by the [[Government of Ontario]] strengthened institutional [[bilingualism]] at the university, with specific instructions to further bilingualism and biculturalism and preserve and develop French culture.<ref name=bilact>{{cite web|url=http://web5.uottawa.ca/admingov/bilingualism.html|title=Regulation on Bilingualism at University Of Ottawa 1974|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=29 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606013859/http://web5.uottawa.ca/admingov/bilingualism.html|archive-date=6 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 11 November 1998, during the University of Ottawa's 150th-anniversary celebrations, two war memorial plaques were unveiled in the foyer of Tabaret Hall which honour 1000 graduates of the university community who took part in armed conflict, especially the list of 50 graduates who lost their lives.<ref>{{National Inventory of Canadian Military Memorials|id=8177|title=Second World War memorial: University of Ottawa: Memorial 35061-020 Ottawa, ON|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>

In 2020, the University of Ottawa attracted significant global media attention due to a [[Controversy over academic freedom at the University of Ottawa|controversy over academic freedom]].

==Campus==
The university's main campus is situated within the neighbourhood of Sandy Hill (''Côte-de-Sable''). The main campus is bordered to the north by the [[ByWard Market]] district, to the east by Sandy Hill's residential area, and to the southwest by [[Nicholas Street]], which runs adjacent to the Rideau Canal on the western half of the university. As of the 2010–2011 academic year, the main campus occupied {{convert|35.3|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, though the university owns and manages other properties throughout the city, raising the university's total extent to {{convert|42.5|ha|acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name=physass>{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.uottawa.ca/en/facts|title=Facts - Physical Resource Services|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=6 June 2012}}</ref> The main campus moved two times before settling in its final location in 1856. When the institution was first founded, the campus was located next to the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. With space a major issue in 1852, the campus moved to a location that is now across from the [[National Gallery of Canada]]. In 1856, the institution moved to its present location.<ref name=tarbs />

The buildings at the university vary in age from [[100 Laurier]] (1893) to 120 University ([[University of Ottawa Faculty of Social Sciences|Faculty of Social Sciences]], 2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.uottawa.ca/en/inventory-buildings|title=Space Inventory by Building 2010-2011|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=6 June 2012}}</ref> In 2011 the average age of buildings was 63.<ref name=physass /> In the 2011–2012 academic year, the university owned and managed 30 main buildings, 806 research laboratories, 301 teaching laboratories and 257 classrooms and seminar rooms.<ref name=Quick /><ref name=physass /> The main campus is divided between its older Sandy Hill campus and its Lees campus, purchased in 2007.

====History====
The library dates back to the foundation of the institution in 1848. In 1903, the main building of the university where the library was located was destroyed by fire; therefore, all the intellectual treasures were lost. After this fire, it was top priority for the university authorities to rebuild the library and it had received donations from Canadian Federal and Provincial Governments and Foreign governments, particularly from France, United States, Great Britain, and other countries. On October 15, 1932, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] informed that a grant of {{USD|1,500}} would be donated to the library over a period of three years which was used for the foundation of the library. In addition, in 1938, the French Government donated a gift which allowed the library to purchase books to the value of {{CAD|800}} and the foundation of the Society of Friends of the Library of the University of Ottawa was founded to help the library restore.<ref>Records and Archives Management of the University of Ottawa, Fonds 315, 215086, BA12.B35R4 and BA12.B35R.2.</ref>

===Museum===
The University of Ottawa Museum of Classical Antiquities was established in 1975 as a teaching collection, operated by the Department of Classical and Religious Studies. Composed of artifacts which reflect daily life during the period from the 7th century BC to the 7th century AD, the permanent collection is enhanced by touring exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cla-srs.uottawa.ca/eng/musee_greco.html|title=Museum of Classical Antiquities|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=28 June 2012}}</ref> The university also houses a student-run gallery space, known as Gallery 115 on the main floor of 100 Laurier East. The student-run gallery provides students the opportunity to work within a gallery setting. It provides graduate and undergraduate students a chance to develop curatorial and administrative skills, as well as, display their own art pieces. In co-operation with the University of Ottawa, the Gallery operates under a democratic structure representing many students enrolled in various programs, including Visual Arts, Art History and Art Administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vasaaeav.com/#!gallery/c1hmr|title=Gallery 115|website=vasaaeav.com|access-date=14 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020023114/http://www.vasaaeav.com/#!gallery/c1hmr|archive-date=20 October 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Several programs from the university placed in the 2011 [[Corporate Knights]] rankings, which measures how well Canadian universities integrate sustainability into their curriculum. Telfer School of Management ranked fifth in Canada for undergraduate business programs. The Corporate Knights also ranked Telfer eighth in Canada for MBA program. The University of Ottawa has implemented a variety of activities in order to increase sustainability across campus. The university has been working on creating a more sustainable campus through the efforts of the Office of Campus Sustainability.

One of the main programs occurring at the University of Ottawa to promote waste reduction is RecycleMania. RecycleMania is a competition among colleges and universities that occurs within a 10-week period of time.<ref name="sustainable.uottawa.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable.uottawa.ca/events/recycle-mania.html|title=RecycleMania 2012 |publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=19 November 2012}}</ref> Each school is to report their trash and recycling data which are then ranked according to the largest quantity of recyclables.<ref name="sustainable.uottawa.ca"/> The purpose of this competition is to see who has the highest recycling rate. As results fluctuate among competitors, schools get more enticed to keep reducing waste.<ref name="sustainable.uottawa.ca"/> In 2011, the University of Ottawa was awarded first place among Canadian universities in the RecycleMania competition.<ref name="sustainable.uottawa.ca"/> The university also ranked 14th out of 180 universities in the “waste minimization” category in the international RecycleMania competition. The RecycleMania program will continue to encourage and inform University of Ottawa students on how to change their consumption habits as well as recycle.<ref name="sustainable.uottawa.ca"/>

One of the newer programs initiated by the University of Ottawa is the Free Store.<ref name="Free Store">{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable.uottawa.ca/freestore.html|title=Free Store|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=19 November 2012}}</ref> The Free Store is a location in which students can drop off items they no longer want and pick up items they do want for free.<ref name="Free Store"/> The reason this was created was to reduce consumption by offering free items to students who no longer want items that may be used by someone else.<ref name="Free Store"/> Items that are dropped off include clothing, textbooks, electronics, and office supplies. The Free Store is located at 647 King Edward.<ref name="Free Store"/> In 2007, the Office of Campus Sustainability coined the term “Gratuiterie” as the French translation to their Free Store. Since then, the concept of la Gratuiterie has gained widespread popularity in France, namely in Grenoble where the first Gratuiterie appeared.<ref name=Gratuiterie>{{cite news|title=La " gratuiterie " récupèreet redistribue|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/grenoble/730144-8239gratuiterie8239-recupereet-redistribue|access-date=16 December 2014|agency=20minutes.fr|publisher=20minutes.fr|date=25 May 2011}}</ref> Since then France has seen a boom of “Gratuiteries” around the country.

On September 1 of 2010, the University of Ottawa stopped selling bottled water on campus and created a [[bottled water ban]] in order to reduce plastic consumption, and encourage students to carry reusable water bottles and use campus water fountains.

The new Social Sciences Building at the University of Ottawa is the school's latest green initiative. The fifteen-storey building that took about four years of planning and construction to complete opened its doors in September 2012.<ref name="socialsciences.uottawa.ca"/> The Social Sciences Building that cost a grand total of $112.5 million provides students and faculty with an array of space for individual studying and group work.<ref name="socialsciences.uottawa.ca"/> This building is the newest addition to the University of Ottawa with its green and sustainable architecture and facilities.<ref name="socialsciences.uottawa.ca"/> This building is very different among the rest of the university's buildings as its structure and characteristics are very eco-friendly. Some features that the building includes are: construction materials that were chosen due to their recycled content, a living wall that is five stories tall and composed of numerous plants that with act as an air filtration system, and a green roof.<ref name="socialsciences.uottawa.ca"/> The green wall is the tallest living [[biofilter]] wall in North America. The wall is situated in the main agora of the Faculty of Social Science building and is visible from the outside. The green wall is a unique component of the building's air handling system, for it is capable of treating a large quantity of air at a time, and it provides a source of humidity that doesn't need to be artificially introduced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Living Walls|first=Nedlaw|title=University of Ottawa: Project Details|url=http://www.naturaire.com/projects/university-of-ottawa|publisher=Nedlaw Living Walls|access-date=16 March 2014}}</ref>

The living wall was built on 14 October 2012, by Diamond & Shmitt Architects.<ref>{{cite web|last=Living Walls|first=Nedlaw|title=University of Ottawa: Project detail|url=http://www.naturaire.com/projects/university-of-ottawa|publisher=Nedlaw Living Walls|access-date=16 March 2014}}</ref> Eighty per cent of the building's heating will be recycled and created through the building's data centres (computer labs, etc.).
<ref name="socialsciences.uottawa.ca"/> This heating system will also heat nearby buildings including Vanier Hall. Not only has the University of Ottawa stayed true to their reputation of being on the forefront of sustainable living by creating the green wall, but they have also created a [[green roof]], which is potentially the first green roof constructed on a Canadian university campus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Campus of Sustainability: Green Buildings and Greenspace|url=http://www.sustainable.uottawa.ca/campus-initiatives/buildings-and-greenspace.html|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=16 March 2014}}</ref>  The green roof was established in 1971 on the rooftop of the Colonel By building.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Campus Sustainability|url=http://www.sustainable.uottawa.ca/campus-initiatives/buildings-and-greenspace.html|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=16 March 2014}}</ref> One of the faculty's goals is to achieve a LEED Gold Certification, which is given to green buildings that meet specific environmental guidelines.<ref name="socialsciences.uottawa.ca"/>

In 2006, the University of Ottawa established the first community campus garden. Over the course of the past eight years, the community garden has expanded in terms of the number of plants that occupy it, and has grown into a full-fledged garden containing more than thirty pots in various locations on campus. The community garden is open from early spring until mid-autumn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Campus of Sustainability: Community Garden|url=http://www.sustainable.uottawa.ca/community-garden.html|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=16 March 2014}}</ref> In addition to the various eco-friendly accomplishments that have been added to the university over the years, in 2005, the university established a boreal forest and wetland environment, and is in the middle of creating a living classroom for students to enjoy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Campus Sustainability: Community Garden|url=http://www.sustainable.uottawa.ca/community-garden.html|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=16 March 2014}}</ref>  The University of Ottawa is on the rise to being one of the top eco-friendly Canadian universities in North America.<ref>{{cite web|title=News: Sustainability at the University of Ottawa|url=http://www.sustainable.uottawa.ca/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=6|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140316175927/http://www.sustainable.uottawa.ca/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=6|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 March 2014|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=16 March 2014}}</ref>

The University of Ottawa has also introduced a bike share program to encourage cycling to and from school. The university offers free bicycle rentals and access to free maintenance and repair workshops.<ref name="socialsciences.uottawa.ca"/> Along with new bike routes and services, the university has enhanced car-pooling and shuttle services, and is served by [[uOttawa station|uOttawa]] and [[Lees station|Lees]] stations along the [[Confederation Line]], encouraging students to use public transit via a discounted university student bus pass.<ref name="socialsciences.uottawa.ca"/>

The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) provides various activities that attempt to increase sustainability practices among individuals and institutions, promote resource sharing, and make sustainable practices a norm within higher education institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aashe.org/about|title=About AASHE |publisher=AASHE |access-date=19 November 2012}}</ref> The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS), created by AASHE, was designed to provide guidelines for better understanding of sustainability and build a more sustainable community throughout university campuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainability.tufts.edu/programs/sustainability-tracking-and-assessment-rating-system-stars/|title=Sustainability Advancement and Tracking System |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=19 November 2012}}</ref> It is a way for universities and colleges to measure their sustainability efforts.

===Bilingualism and biculturalism===
[[File:OLBI at 70 Laurier Avenue East.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Official Languages and Bilingualism Institute]], a language institute affiliated with the university, is housed at Hamelin Hall.]]
As of 2016, the university was the world's largest English-French bilingual university.<ref name=Quick /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obj.ca/Local/2012-05-24/article-2985971/U-of-O-contributes-billions-to-economy-each-year:-study/1|title=U of O contributes billions to economy each year: study|work=Ottawa Business Journal|publisher=Great River Media|date=24 May 2012|access-date=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317110334/http://www.obj.ca/Local/2012-05-24/article-2985971/U-of-O-contributes-billions-to-economy-each-year:-study/1|archive-date=17 March 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The university is one of the three bilingual universities in Ontario that is not [[Affiliated school|federated]] with a larger university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/eng/postsecondary/schoolsprograms/frenchlanguage.html#universities|title=French Language and Bilingual Colleges and Universities|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|date=13 April 2011|access-date=29 May 2012}}</ref> Since its inception the university has seen itself as fostering English-French bilingualism.<ref>{{cite book|title=No Lesser Place: The Taaldebat at Stellenbosch|last=Brink|first=Chris|publisher=African Sun Media|year=2006|page=54|isbn=1-9199-8095-4}}</ref> However, bilingualism was only made an official university policy in 1965 when the Government of Ontario passed ''An Act respecting Université d'Ottawa'' through the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/administration-and-governance/1965-university-of-ottawa-act|title=Administration and Governance - University of Ottawa|website=www.uottawa.ca}}</ref> Section 4 of that Act specifically states that an object and purpose of the university is"to further bilingualism and biculturalism and to preserve and develop French culture in Ontario", and "to further ... Christian principles".  Despite that law, these parts of the university's mandate are now arguably superseded by the 1982 ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which constitutionalizes multiculturalism (not biculturalism) and freedom of religion.

The university operates the [[Official Languages and Bilingualism Institute]] (OLBI). The OLBI was officially opened on 1 July 2007, replacing its predecessor, the Second Language Institute. Both institutes promoted English-French bilingualism, although the OLBI holds an expanded mandate, to strengthen research, innovation and outreach efforts in official languages and bilingualism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olbi.uottawa.ca/institute.php|title=The Institute|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=29 May 2012}}</ref> The university is a member of the [[Association of Universities of the Canadian Francophonie]], an association which promotes post-secondary education and research in French.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aufc.ca/accueil.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110706164817/http://www.aufc.ca/accueil.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2011|title=Association des universités de la francophonie canadienne|publisher=association des universités de la francophonie canadienne|year=2012|access-date=29 May 2012|language=fr}}</ref>

The two main student unions on administrative and policy issues are the [[University of Ottawa Students' Union]] (UOSU) for all undergraduate students and the Graduate Students' Association (GSAÉD) for graduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uosu-seuo.com/about|title=UOSU- About Us|publisher=University of Ottawa Students' Union|access-date=25 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202203506/https://www.uosu-seuo.com/|archive-date=2 February 2019|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gsaed.ca/en/section/12|title=GSAÉD - About Us|publisher=GSAÉD|year=2012|access-date=28 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914025302/http://gsaed.ca/en/section/12|archive-date=14 September 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Additionally, graduate (and undergraduate) students who are employed as research assistants, teaching assistants, markers, proctors, and lifeguards are members of CUPE2626, a local chapter of the [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]]. The union and the university are bound by a collective agreement.

Until December 2018, the [[Student Federation of the University of Ottawa]] acted as the undergraduate student union, until it lost its official status, after their agreement was terminated with the university. The university cited the SFUO's handling of allegations of financial mismanagement, fraud, and workplace misconduct as the reason. In 2019, students voted to choose a new undergraduate student association in a referendum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.uottawa.ca/news/university-ottawa-terminates-agreement-sfuo#QA|title = University of Ottawa Terminates Agreement with SFUO}}</ref> On February 11, 2019 the University of Ottawa announced the results of the student referendum. The University of Ottawa announced the University of Ottawa Students’ Union (UOSU) had been selected as the new student union to represent undergraduate students. The university will make its best efforts to have a new agreement in place by May 1, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.uottawa.ca/news/statement-university-student-referendum-results|title = A statement by the University on the student referendum results}}</ref>

Eventually the shorthand became official.<ref name=sport /> Because the term gee gee also describes the lead horse in a race, the horse became UOttawa's mascot.<ref name=sport />

The university owns and operates three athletic facilities on the university's two campuses.

Montpetit is centrally located on campus and is the home to the varsity basketball and swimming teams. The Minto Sports Complex houses the university's two arena ice rinks, which seat 840 as well as Matt Anthony Field the home of Gee-Gees soccer and rugby, which seats 1,500.
