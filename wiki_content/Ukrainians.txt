==Origin==
{{further|Early Slavs|East Slavs|Ruthenians|Prehistoric Ukraine}}
The [[East Slavs]] emerged from the undifferentiated [[early Slavs]] in the [[Slavic migrations]] of the 6th and 7th centuries CE. The state of [[Kyivan Rus]] united the East Slavs during the 9th to 13th centuries. East Slavic tribes cited{{By whom|date=June 2019}} as "proto-Ukrainian" include the [[Volhynians]], [[Drevlyans|Derevlianians]], [[Polans (eastern)|Polianians]], and [[Severians|Siverianians]] and the less significant [[Ulichs|Ulychians]], [[Tivertsi]]ans, and [[White Croats]].<ref>

Differentiation between separate East Slavic groups began to emerge in the later medieval period, and an East Slavic [[dialect continuum]] developed within the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the [[Ruthenian language]] emerging as a written standard. The active development of a concept of a Ukrainian nation and a Ukrainian language began with the [[Ukrainian National Revival]] in the early 19th century. In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet era]] (1917–1991), [[Historiography in the Soviet Union|official historiography]] emphasized "the cultural unity of 'proto-Ukrainians' and 'proto-Russians' in the fifth and sixth centuries".<ref name="Yekelchyk2004">{{cite book|author=Serhy Yekelchyk|author-link=Serhy Yekelchyk|title=Stalin's Empire of Memory: Russian-Ukrainian Relations in the Soviet Historical Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzSEEqjp9vUC&pg=PA94|access-date=19 March 2016|year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8808-6|page=94}}</ref>

[[File:Structure plot of European populations from the Genome Ukraine Project.jpg|thumb| Structure plot of European populations from the Genome Ukraine Project]] In addition to the close geographic distance between these populations, this may also reflect the insufficient representation of samples from the surrounding populations.

Ukraine has had a very turbulent history, a fact explained by its geographical position. In the 9th century the [[Varangians]] from [[Scandinavia]] conquered the proto-Slavic tribes on the territory of today's Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia and laid the groundwork for the [[Kyivan Rus]] state. The ancestors of the Ukrainian nation such as [[Polans (eastern)|Polianians]] had an important role in the development and culturalization of Kyivan Rus state. The internecine wars between Rus princes, which began after the death of [[Yaroslav the Wise]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\Y\A\YaroslavtheWise.htm |title=Grand prince of Kyiv from 1019; son of Grand Prince Volodymyr the Great and Princess Rohnida of Polatsk |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |access-date=2 November 2012}}</ref> led to the political fragmentation of the state into a number of principalities. The quarreling between the princes left Kyivan Rus vulnerable to foreign attacks, and the invasion of the Mongols in 1236. and 1240. finally destroyed the state. Another important state in the history of the Ukrainians is [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Kingdom of Ruthenia]] (1199–1349).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\K\Y\KyivanRushDA.htm |title=The first state to arise among the Eastern Slavs |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |access-date=2 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\G\A\Galicia6VolhyniaPrincipalityof.htm |title=A state founded in 1199 by Roman Mstyslavych, the prince of Volhynia from 1170, who united Galicia and Volhynia under his rule |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |access-date=2 November 2012}}</ref>

The third important state for Ukrainians is [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. The Cossacks of [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporizhia]] since the late 15th century controlled the lower bends of the river Dnieper, between Russia, Poland and the [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars of Crimea]], with the fortified capital, [[Zaporizhian Sich]]. Hetman [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] is one of the most celebrated and at the same time most controversial political figures in Ukraine's early-modern history. A brilliant military leader, his greatest achievement in the process of national revolution was the formation of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] state of the Zaporozhian Host (1648–1782). The period of the [[The Ruin (Ukrainian history)|Ruin]] in the late 17th century in the history of Ukraine is characterized by the disintegration of Ukrainian statehood and general decline. During the Ruin Ukraine became divided along the Dnieper River into [[Left-Bank Ukraine]] and [[Right-Bank Ukraine]], and the two-halves became hostile to each other. Ukrainian leaders during the period are considered to have been largely opportunists and men of little vision who could not muster broad popular support for their policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\R\U\Ruin.htm |title=The disintegration of Ukrainian statehood and general decline – Ruina |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |access-date=2 November 2012}}</ref> There were roughly 4 million Ukrainians at the end of the 17th century.<ref>Ukraine, Orest Subtelny, page 152, 2000</ref>

At the final stages of the First World War, a powerful struggle for an independent Ukrainian state developed in the central Ukrainian territories, which, until 1917, were part of the [[Russian Empire]]. The newly established Ukrainian government, the [[Central Rada]], headed by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], issued four universals, the Fourth of which, dated 22 January 1918, declared the independence and sovereignty of the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] (UNR) on 25 January 1918. The session of the Central Rada on 29 April 1918 ratified the Constitution of the UNR and elected Hrushevsky president.<ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/>

During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], Soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in the Ukrainian culture and language. Ukrainisation was part of the Soviet-wide policy of [[Korenisation]] (literally indigenisation). The Bolsheviks were also committed to universal health care, education and social-security benefits, as well as the right to work and housing. Starting from the late 1920s with a centrally planned economy, Ukraine was involved in [[Soviet industrialisation]] and the republic's industrial output quadrupled during the 1930s.

During 1932–1933, millions of Ukrainians were starved to death by a Soviet regime which led to a [[famine]], known as the [[Holodomor]].<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm Ukraine remembers famine horror]". BBC News. 24 November 2007.</ref> The Soviet regime remained silent about the Holodomor and provided no aid to the victims or the survivors. But news and information about what was going on reached the West and evoked public responses in Polish-ruled Western Ukraine and in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. Since the 1990s the independent Ukrainian state, particularly under President [[Viktor Yushchenko]], the Ukrainian mass media and academic institutions, many foreign governments, most Ukrainian scholars, and many foreign scholars have viewed and written about the Holodomor as genocide and issued official declarations and publications to that effect.

Following the [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, German and Soviet troops divided the territory of Poland. Thus, [[Eastern Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]] with their Ukrainian population became part of Ukraine. For the first time in history, the nation was united.
German armies invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, initiating nearly four years of total war.
In total, the number of ethnic Ukrainians who fought in the ranks of the Soviet Army is estimated from 4.5 million to 7 million. The pro-Soviet partisan guerrilla resistance in Ukraine is estimated to number at 47,800 from the start of occupation to 500,000 at its peak in 1944, with about 50% being ethnic Ukrainians. Of the estimated 8.6 million Soviet troop losses, 1.4 million were ethnic Ukrainians. [[Victory Day]] is celebrated as one of ten Ukrainian national holidays.

===Historical maps of Ukraine===
The Ukrainian state has occupied a number of territories since its initial foundation. Most of these territories have been located within Eastern Europe, however, as depicted in the maps in the gallery below, has also at times extended well into [[Eurasia]] and South-Eastern Europe. At times there has also been a distinct lack of a Ukrainian state, as its territories were on a number of occasions, annexed by its more powerful neighbours.

The watershed period in the development of modern Ukrainian national consciousness was the struggle for independence during the creation of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] from 1917 to 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\U\K\UkrainianNationalRepublic.htm|title=Ukrainian National Republic|publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com|year=1993|access-date=15 March 2016}}</ref> A concerted effort to reverse the growth of Ukrainian national consciousness was begun by the regime of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the late 1920s, and continued with minor interruptions until the most recent times.

Despite this, many Ukrainians played prominent roles in the Soviet Union, including such public figures as [[Semyon Timoshenko|Semen Tymoshenko]].

The creation of a sovereign and independent Ukraine in 1991, however, pointed to the failure of the policy of the "merging of nations" and to the enduring strength of the Ukrainian national consciousness. Today, one of the consequences of these acts is [[Anti-Ukrainian sentiment|Ukrainophobia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\U\K\Ukrainians.htm|title=Development of modern Ukrainian national consciousness|publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com|date=16 July 1990|access-date=2 November 2012}}</ref>

[[Biculturalism]] is especially present in southeastern Ukraine where there is a significant Russian minority.

Attempts to introduce a territorial-political concept of Ukrainian nationality on the Western European model (presented by political philosopher [[Viacheslav Lypynsky]]) were unsuccessful until the 1990s.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Ukraine}}
[[File:08574 IV International Folklore Festival Etnovyr in Lviv August, 2011.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian traditional clothes]]
Due to Ukraine's geographical location, its culture primarily exhibits Eastern European influence as well as Central European to an extent (primarily in the western region). Over the years it has been influenced by movements such as those brought about during the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Renaissance. Today, the country is somewhat culturally divided with the western regions bearing a stronger Central European influence and the eastern regions showing a significant Russian influence. A strong [[Christianity|Christian culture]] was predominant for many centuries, although Ukraine was also the center of conflict between the Catholic, Orthodox and Islamic spheres of influence.

===Languages===
{{Main|Ukrainian language}}

[[File:Ukrainians en.svg|thumb|Spread of Ukrainian language in the beginning of 20th century]]
[[File:Ukraine census 2001 Ukrainian.svg|thumb|Population of those whose mother tongue is Ukrainian in Ukraine (2001)]]

Ukrainian ({{lang|uk|украї́нська мо́ва}}, ''ukraі́nska móva'') is a language of the [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic subgroup]] of the [[Slavic languages]]. It is the only [[official language|official state language]] of Ukraine. Written Ukrainian uses the [[Ukrainian alphabet]], one of many based on the [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic alphabet]].

The Ukrainian language traces its origins to the [[Old East Slavic language]] of the medieval state of [[Kyivan Rus]]. In its earlier stages it was called [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] in Latin. Ukrainian, along with all other East Slavic languages, is a lineal descendant of the colloquial language used in Kyivan Rus (10th–13th century).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Ukrainian-language|title=Ukrainian language|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=15 March 2016}}</ref>

While the [[Golden Horde]] placed officials in key [[Kyivan Rus]] areas, practised forced resettlement, and even renamed urban centers to suit their own language, the Mongols did not attempt to annihilate [[Kyivan Rus]] society and culture. The second onslaught began with the destruction of [[Kyiv]] by the Golden Horde in 1240. This khanate formed the western part of a great [[Mongol Empire]] that had been founded by [[Genghis Khan]] in the early 13th century.  After the [[Mongol]] destruction of [[Kyivan Rus]] in the 13th century, literary activity in Ukraine declined. A revival began in the late 18th century in eastern Ukraine with overlapping literary and academic phases at a time when nostalgia for the [[Cossack]] past and resentment at the loss of autonomy still lingered on.

The language has persisted despite several periods of bans and/or discouragement throughout centuries as it has always nevertheless maintained a sufficient base among the people of Ukraine, its folklore songs, [[kobzar|itinerant musicians]], and prominent authors.

===Religions===
{{Main|Religion in Ukraine}}
[[File:P1510026-1.JPG|thumb|left|The historic [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kyiv]].]]

Ukraine was inhabited by [[Paganism|pagan]] tribes until [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine rite]] Christianity was introduced by the turn of the first millennium. It was imagined by later writers who sought to put Kyivan Christianity on the same level of primacy as Byzantine Christianity that [[Apostle Andrew]] himself had visited the site where the city of [[Kyiv]] would be later built.

However it was only by the 10th century that the emerging state, the [[Kievan Rus'|Kyivan Rus]], became influenced by the [[Byzantine Empire]]; the first known conversion was by the Princess [[Olga of Kiev|Saint Olga]] who came to [[Constantinople]] in 945 or 957. Several years later, her grandson, Kniaz [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] baptised his people in the [[Dnieper River]]. This began a long history of the dominance of the Eastern Orthodoxy in Ruthenia (Ukraine).

Ukrainians are predominantly [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christians, and they form the [[List of contemporary ethnic groups|second largest ethno-linguistic group among Eastern Orthodox]] in the world.<ref name="Pew20152016">{{cite web|title=Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/religious-belief-and-national-belonging-in-central-and-eastern-europe/|website=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|date=10 May 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Orthodox Christianity in the 21st Century

===Music===
[[File:Театр оперы и балета. Зал.jpg|thumbnail|[[Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater|Odessa Opera House]]]]
{{Main|Music of Ukraine}}
Ukrainian music incorporates a diversity of external cultural influences. It also has a very strong indigenous [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and Christian uniqueness whose elements were used among many neighboring nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/alphasearch.asp?q=music|title=Ukrainian Music Elements|work=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies|year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/Culture.asp#Topic_3|title=Ukrainian Wandering Bards: Kobzars, Bandurysts, and Lirnyks|publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies|year=2001|access-date=15 March 2016|quote=The artistic tradition of Ukrainian wandering bards, the kobzars (kobza players), bandurysts (bandura players), and lirnyks (lira players) is one of the most distinctive elements of Ukraine's cultural heritage.}}</ref>

Ukrainian folk oral literature, poetry, and songs (such as the dumas) are among the most distinctive ethnocultural features of Ukrainians as a people. Religious music existed in Ukraine before the official adoption of Christianity, in the form of plainsong "obychnyi spiv" or "musica practica". Traditional Ukrainian music is easily recognized by its somewhat melancholy tone. It first became known outside of Ukraine during the 15th century as musicians from Ukraine would perform before the royal courts in Poland (latter in Russia).

A large number of famous musicians around the world was educated or born in Ukraine, among them are famous names like [[Dmitry Bortniansky]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Myroslav Skoryk]], etc. Ukraine is also the rarely acknowledged musical heartland of the former [[Russian Empire]], home to its first professional music academy, which opened in the mid-18th century and produced numerous early musicians and composers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/country/content.country/ukraine/en_US|title=Ukraine is the rarely acknowledged musical heartland of the former Russian Empire|work=National Geographic Society|year=2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515005555/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/country/content.country/ukraine/en_US|archive-date=15 May 2011}}</ref>

===Dance===
{{Main|Ukrainian dance}}
[[File:Hopak at Rapid Trident 2014.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian dance ''[[Hopak]]''.]]
[[Ukrainian dance]] refers to the traditional [[folk dance]]s of the peoples of Ukraine. Today, Ukrainian dance is primarily represented by what [[Ethnography|ethnographers]], [[Folklore|folklorists]] and dance historians refer to as "Ukrainian Folk-Stage Dances", which are stylized representations of traditional dances and their characteristic movements that have been choreographed for [[concert dance]] performances. This stylized art form has so permeated the [[culture of Ukraine]], that very few purely traditional forms of Ukrainian dance remain today.

Ukrainian dance is often described as energetic, fast-paced, and entertaining, and along with traditional Easter eggs (''[[pysanky]]''), it is a characteristic example of Ukrainian culture recognized and appreciated throughout the world.
