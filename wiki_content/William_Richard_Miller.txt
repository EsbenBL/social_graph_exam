==Career==

Miller is emeritus distinguished professor of [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] and affiliated with the Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addictions (CASAA) at the [[University of New Mexico]] (UNM).<ref>http://www.williamrmiller.net</ref> He joined the UNM faculty in 1976. He has taught a wide range of subjects, including courses on [[alcoholism]] and [[abnormal psychology]], and seminars on [[positive psychology]] and on [[self-fulfilling prophecies]]. His primary scientific interest is in the psychology of change, but his research spans the treatment of addictive behaviors, self-regulation, spirituality and psychology, motivation for change, and pastoral psychology. He has been a visiting scholar at the Oregon Health & Science University, the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, Stanford University, and the University of Bergen and the Hjellestad Clinic in Norway.

===Motivational interviewing===

Miller has changed the way clinicians think about the nature of [[substance use disorders]], their treatment and the means to effect change in patients. Early in his career, he emphasized that not all alcohol problems are severe and tested briefer interventions for mid-range problem drinkers. His [[meta-analysis]] of the research on treatments of alcohol problems shows a [[rank ordering]] of those treatments with the most effective being active and empathic (brief interventions and motivational enhancement), while the least effective are passive (films, lectures) or confrontational.<ref name="Hester Miller 2003">Hester, R. K. & Miller, W. R., eds. ''Handbook of Alcoholism treatment Approaches: Effective Alternatives 3rd ed.''Allyn & Bacon, 2003</ref> He also demonstrated through controlled experiment that confrontation leads to states of resistance and denial, which many in the addiction field attribute to traits of those with [[addiction]]. [[Motivational interviewing]], or motivational enhancement therapy, avoids creating such resistance by avoiding confrontation and eliciting motivation with open-ended questions and empathy.<ref name="Hester Miller 2003"/>
