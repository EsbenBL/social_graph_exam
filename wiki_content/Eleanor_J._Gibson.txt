'''Eleanor Jack Gibson''' (7 December 1910 – 30 December 2002) was an American [[psychologist]] who focused on reading development and perceptual learning in infants. Gibson began her career at Smith College as an instructor in 1932, publishing her first works on research conducted as an undergraduate student. Gibson was able to circumvent the many obstacles she faced due to the [[Great Depression]] and gender discrimination, by finding research opportunities that she could meld with her own interests. Gibson, with her husband [[James J. Gibson]], created the [[Gibsonian ecological theory of development]], which emphasized how important perception was because it allows humans to adapt to their environments. Perhaps her most well-known contribution to psychology was the "[[visual cliff]],” which studied [[depth perception]] in both human and animal species, leading to a new understanding of perceptual development in infants. Gibson was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1971, the [[National Academy of Education]] in 1972, and to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1977. In 1992, she was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].

== Early life ==
Eleanor (née Jack) Gibson was born on December 7th, 1910 in [[Peoria, Illinois]]. Her father, William Alexander Jack, was a businessman who specialized in the wholesale of hardware. Her mother, Isabel Grier Jack, was a homemaker who graduated from [[Smith College]]. Gibson had one sibling, Emily Jack, who was born in 1916.<ref name="Caudle, F. M. (2003)">Caudle, F. M. (2003). Eleanor Jack Gibson (1910-2002). American Psychologist, 58(12), 1090-1091. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.58.12.1090</ref>

=== Family ===
Gibson met her husband, [[James J. Gibson|James Gibson]], at the end of her junior year at Smith while attending a graduation garden party. James was an assistant professor, and the day after meeting James, Gibson changed her schedule to include James’ advanced [[experimental psychology]] course. They married in September 1932. Their first child, James J. Gibson, Junior, was born in 1940. Their second child, Jean Gibson, was born in 1943. Gibson decided to take a break from research for a few years in order to focus on her children and teaching.<ref name="Caudle, F. M. (2003)"/>

=== Education ===
Gibson began attending Smith College at the age of sixteen with the intention of studying languages. She graduated in 1931 with a [[B.A. degree]]. While at Smith, she became interested in experimental psychology.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)">Eppler, M. (2006). Eleanor Jack Gibson: 1910-2002. The American Journal of Psychology, 119(1), 121-127.</ref> Gibson completed her [[master's degree]] at Smith, graduating in 1933.<ref name="Caudle, F. M. (2003)"/> In 1935, Gibson began her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[Yale University]]. While attending Yale, Gibson became interested in [[comparative psychology]]. Originally, Gibson had asked [[Robert Yerkes]] to be her dissertation advisor. He declined, stating that he does not permit women to work in his lab. [[Clark L. Hull]], a [[Behaviorism|behavioural psychologist]], became her dissertation supervisor,<ref name=":1">American psychological foundation awards for 1986: Gold medal Awards. (1987). ''American Psychologist, 42''(4), 327-332. </ref><ref name=":2">Rodkey, E. N. (2011, July). The woman behind the visual cliff. ''Monitor on Psychology'', ''42''(7). <nowiki>http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/07-08/gibson</nowiki></ref> despite the fact that they did not necessarily have the same theoretical perspective.<ref name="Caudle, F. M. (2003)"/> Gibson completed her dissertation on differentiation using behaviourist terminology. After a year at Yale, Gibson passed the required exams and moved back to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], where she continued to teach at Smith. She completed her dissertation two years later in 1938, at which point she received her doctorate from Yale.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/>

== Academic career ==
Gibson began working at Smith College as an instructor in 1932. She took a year off in 1935 to pursue her Ph.D. at Yale University, before returning as an instructor at Smith College. In 1940, Gibson became an assistant professor at Smith.<ref name="Caudle, F. M. (2003)"/> In 1941, James Gibson was requested to conduct perception research in the Flying Training Command of the [[United States Air Force]] at which point the family moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. After a period of time, they moved to [[Santa Ana, California]]. After [[World War II]] ended, they moved back to Northampton, Massachusetts. Gibson resumed her position at Smith College in 1946.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/> 

In 1949, James Gibson took a job at [[Cornell University]], requiring that the family move to [[Ithaca, New York]]. Gibson was unable to obtain a job at Cornell due to [[Nepotism|anti-nepotism]] policies prohibiting her from working in the same department as her husband. Thus, Gibson became an unpaid research associate. She continued her research by reaching out to other Cornell faculty, working alongside [[Howard Liddell (psychologist)|Howard Liddell]], a professor in Psychology. Gibson worked in Liddell's Behaviour Farm Laboratory, giving her experience working with and rearing baby animals.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">Szokolszky, A. (2003). An interview with Eleanor Gibson. ''Ecological Psychology, 15''(4), 271-281. doi:10.1207/s15326969eco1504_2</ref> Gibson's interest in development grew after working with the animals.<ref name=":3" /> Liddell's Behaviour Farm is where the discovery of the behaviour that led to the Visual Cliff took place. After conducting research there for two years, Gibson left the Behaviour Farm upon finding out that her control group of goats was given away.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/> Later, Gibson received funding from the United States Air Force and grants from the [[United States Navy]] to work on perceptual learning. In order to further explore this topic, Gibson and her husband, James, co-authored a study on the perception of nonsense scribbles, eventually leading to the differentiation theory.<ref name="Caudle, F. M. (2003)"/> Additionally, when Richard Walk was hired at Cornell University, Gibson and Walk decided to explore discrimination learning on rats who were raised in different environments, eventually leading to the Visual Cliff experiment.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/> Their work together ended when Walk left Cornell University to pursue work at [[George Washington University]].<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/> 

In 1966, James took a job elsewhere and was no longer employed by Cornell University. With anti-nepotism policies no longer an issue, Gibson became a professor at Cornell with tenure. After her academic partnership with Walk ended, Gibson was asked to join an interdisciplinary project with the goal of achieving a better understanding of the reading processes.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/> 

In 1972, Gibson became the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Psychology and was given her own lab. At this point, Gibson turned her focus to perception in infants and turned her new lab into an infant perception lab.<ref name="Caudle, F. M. (2003)"/>

In 1979, Gibson was forced to retire from her faculty position, the same year that her husband, James, passed away. Prior to her retirement, she began visiting other universities, and continued to do so for many years afterwards. Gibson continued to work in her lab until 1987, at which point she moved to [[Middlebury, Vermont]], to live closer to her daughter.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/>

=== Zeitgeist (Spirit of the Times) ===
Eleanor Gibson lived through the period of the Great Depression and when [[gender discrimination]] was considered the norm.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)" /> The time and social norms influenced her career. Gibson attended Smith College to complete her B.A. degree and M.S. degree. Smith College, at the time, provided Gibson the opportunity to be in an atmosphere that challenged and encouraged women to be scholars and scientists. Living through the Great Depression impacted her in a way where, due to financial issues and marriage, she could not begin her Ph.D. program until years later. She stayed as an instructor at Smith College for two years teaching labs before she set off to Yale University to obtain her Ph.D.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)" /> 

In the spirit of the times, Yale University, unlike Smith College, did not support women's careers. Yale University did not provide financial assistance toward Gibson's post-secondary studies. Smith College awarded Gibson with a scholarship to continue her studies at Yale University, covering her tuition. Eleanor Gibson had strong interests in comparative psychology. Her interests led her to approach [[Robert Yerkes]] as her dissertation advisor.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)" /> As gender discrimination was the norm, Yerks initially dismissed Gibson. Yerkes did not allow women to work in his laboratory.<ref name=":1" /> Gibson faced many gender barriers but sought alternatives to complete her goals. Gibson successfully completed her studies at Yale University, earning her Ph.D. in 1938.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)" />

Gibson's academic career was disrupted due to the [[World War II|war]]<ref name=":1" /> and after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on Pearl Harbour]] in 1941.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)" /> She accompanied her husband, James Gibson, to Texas and later California as he conducted research in the Flying Training Command of the [[Army Air Force]]. Eleanor Gibson continued her academic career at Smith College as a teacher after a 4-year hiatus.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)" />

In 1949, Gibson and her husband left [[Smith College]] and moved to Cornell University.<ref name=":1" /> Cornell, at the time, did not hire women as part of their faculty.<ref name=":3" /> Cornell also had an anti-nepotism rule that did not allow her to work as a faculty member because her husband, James Gibson, had already been hired into their Psychology department.<ref name=":2" /> Gibson would work as a research associate for 16 years,<ref name=":1" /> unpaid.<ref name=":2" /> Gibson continued her research whilst facing gender discrimination and anti-nepotism rules.

== Death ==
In Eleanor Gibson's final years she was focused on writing and publishing books. Her goal was to illustrate her progression of thinking. Her book titled, “An Odyssey in Learning and Perception”<ref>Gibson, E. J. (1991). ''Learning, development, and conceptual change. An odyssey in learning and perception''. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.</ref> is a collection of her academic papers starting from the 1930s. The book encompasses her 50 years of work toward [[perceptual learning]] and [[Developmental psychology|development]].<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/>

In 2002, before her death, Gibson published a final book. Her final book was initially written as a personal family history but later evolved into a story about the lives of two psychologists.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)"/>  She titled her final book: “Perceiving the affordances: A portrait of two psychologists.”<ref>Gibson, E. J. (2002). ''Perceiving the affordances: A portrait of two psychologists''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates</ref> Gibson died on December 30, 2002, in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].

== Contributions to psychology ==

=== Perceptual learning ===

Gibson was highly influenced by the work of her husband, James Gibson. Together they developed the [[Gibsonian ecological theory of development]]. This theory influenced her research on [[perceptual learning]].

Gibson believed that a radically different new view of [[perceptual learning]] was needed. One of her major studies involved the steps to how children perceive their environment.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”">Benjafield, J. G. (2015). A History of Psychology (4th ed.). Don Mills, ON, Canada: Oxford University Press</ref> Gibson and her husband argued that the aspect of learning is to strengthen your insight or perception of the environment.<ref name="“Gibson_&_Gibson_1955”">Gibson, J. J., & Gibson, E. J. (1955). Perceptual learning: Differentiation or enrichment? Psychological Review, 62(1), 32-41.</ref> This process of perceptual learning was deemed a part of [[#Differentiation theory|differentiation]] by Gibson and her husband. Humans first have the tendency to [[categorize]] everything that appears similar into groups. In other words, people tend to [[overgeneralize]]. With perceptual learning, humans can battle the tendency to overgeneralize by learning to make appropriate distinctions, such as the specific patterns and properties of different stimulus. An example Gibson and her husband used to describe this is that someone who regularly participates in wine tasting can taste the differences in many wines. However, someone participating for the very first time might think many if not all wines taste the same.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”" />

Gibson worked with her husband James on a joint study to explore the perception of nonsense scribbles to clarify this concept of perceptual learning. The study consisted of three different groups. The first group had ten participants between 6 and 8 year olds. The second group had ten participants between 8½ to 11 year olds. The third group had twelve participants that were adults.<ref name="“Gibson_&_Gibson_1955”" /> 

The participants were tasked to identify one standard scribble from a set of similar scribbles varying in many different dimensions. The scribbles contained coils ranging from three to five and they were different in lengths. Some coils spiral clockwise while other coils spiral counter-clockwise. The experiment had a deck of cards with a different scribble on each card. Also included within the deck were various cards printed with other figures.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”" /> The participants were given a target to look at for around 5s. They were informed that some of the cards had coils printed on them that are identical to the target. Next, each card was presented to the participant for about 3s.<ref name="“Gibson_&_Gibson_1955”" /> They were tasked in choosing the cards that were identical to the target.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”" /> In the first trial, the deck of cards consist of 17 scribbles that were similar to the target and 12 other prints that were all very different from both the target and each other.<ref name="“Gibson_&_Gibson_1955”" />

Results showed that three groups learned to identify and differentiate items at various levels and various rates. In the first trial, the group with the youngest participants were able to identify most of the scribbles identical to the target, an average of 13.4. This was followed by the group with the older children who identified more than the third group, an average of 7.9. The group consisting of adults identified the least identical items, an average of 3.0. However, results also indicated that the group of adults were able to achieve perfect identification within an average of 3.1 trials, while the group of older kids achieved it within an average of 4.7 trials.<ref name="“Gibson_&_Gibson_1955”" /> On the contrary, many of the young children in the first group failed to match any correct coil to the target.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”" /> The number of trials needed to achieve perfect identification could not be achieved within the duration of the study.<ref name="“Gibson_&_Gibson_1955”" />

At first the standard scribble was imperceptible from the other scribbles but after repeated tests the standard scribble became clear. The participants were tested until the standard was identified correctly without any correction given. The Gibson's then stated that the stimulus held all the information for perception rather than the participants learning to perceive through an associative process. This resulted in perceptual learning as being redefined as a change in what was perceived by an observer became more sensitive to the different aspects of a stimulus. At the beginning of the study, many of the stimuli or coil, appear to look identical. But with practice, the participants learn to tell the stimuli apart from one another. The process of perceptual learning occurs faster over time through repetition.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”" />

Gibson states that differentiation is a crucial aspect to both [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[developmental psychology]]. Perceptual learning allow humans to respond differently yet appropriately to the stimuli in their environment.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”" /> Gibson said that the links between the perceiver and their environment is the domain for where perceptual development occurs. She states that a person has only achieved perceptual learning of [[Perceptual learning#Selective reweighting|specificity]] if they can differentiate one object from another and if they can identify the properties of that object.<ref name="“Gibson_&_Gibson_1955”" />

Another study Gibson did in perceptual learning is the perception of words and spelling patterns. Learning to read is a crucial aspect in child development and is complicated as words can have different meanings when perceived by the reader. Gibson was interested in factors enabling a reader to reach the stage where they can instantly tell words apart. Gibson argues that pronounceability has an impact in reading as certain combinations of the alphabet are easier to pronounce than others. Certain letters pair well in certain positions in words which allows for easier perception. According to Gibson, these particular spelling patterns are pronounced the same. For example, the positions of the letters “glurck” is pronounceable despite it not being an English word. On the other hand, the positions of “ckurgl” is not as easy to pronounce. A person fluent in English may notice that the letters “gl” is the start of many words while “ck” is at the end of many words. Such spelling patterns in words allow a reader to easily perceive the words to pronounce.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”" />

==== Differentiation theory ====

Within her research on perceptual learning, Eleanor Gibson was particularly interested in, what she termed, the ''differentiation theory''.<ref name="Gibson 1969">Gibson, E. J. (1969). ''Principles of perceptual learning and development''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.</ref> The differentiation theory states that in the information received from sensory stimulation, individuals discriminate objects in the environment and experiences by identifying unique characteristics about them, termed ''distinctive features''.<ref name="Gibson 1969" />

[[File:Eleanor Gibson 1962 letter-like forms study - standard forms and transformations.png|thumb|Eleanor Gibson 1962 letter-like forms study - standard forms and transformations]]

Eleanor Gibson performed a study to examine how young children discriminate between different “letter-like forms”.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962">Gibson, E. J., Gibson, J. J., Pick, A. D., & Osser, H. (1962). A developmental study of the discrimination of letter-like forms. ''Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 55''(6), 897-906. doi:10.1037/h0043190</ref> The children used in the study were between ages 4 and 8 years old.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> The children were given 13 standard letter-like forms in a column on the left-hand side of the page to examine.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> Several variations in each letter-like form, termed [[Geometric transformation|''transformations'']], were given along the rows.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> The transformations were either slight changes in appearance by altering the lines in the form (“topological transformation” and “line-to-curve transformation”) or a change in the perspective of the letter (“rotational-reversal transformation” and “perspective transformation”) while keeping the form identical.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> The task given to the children was to determine and indicate which transformations were no different from the standard forms.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> Overall, as age increased, the amount of incorrect differentiations made decreased.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> However, this varied depending on the level of difficulty of the transformations.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> The results demonstrated that the 4 to 5 year olds had great difficulties with all variations of the forms whereas the 6 to 8 year olds performed much better and were able to discriminate between the standard letter-like forms and the variations shown.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> The following list is ordered from the transformations that had the largest decrease in errors (largest improvement) to the smallest (least improvement), as age increased: rotational-reversal, line-to-curve, perspective, topological.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" /> These results contribute to the research on perceptual learning in that they suggest that children learn distinctive characteristics to be used for differentiation which is a large component of the identification of letters.<ref name="Gibson et al. 1962" />

=== Visual cliff ===

Eleanor had been studying the development and process of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] in goats when the inspiration for the visual cliff was spontaneously discovered.<ref name="Rodkey, N, E. (2015)">Rodkey, N, E. (2015). The visual cliff’s forgotten menagerie: rats, goats, babies, and myth-making in the history of psychology. ''Journal of the History of the Behavioural Sciences, 51''(2), 113-140. doi: 10.1002/jhbs.21712</ref> While washing one of the baby goats, another was about to be born.<ref name="Rodkey, N, E. (2015)"/> Acting quickly, she placed the goat on an object elevated off the ground.<ref name="Rodkey, N, E. (2015)"/> The newborn did not move from where she placed it, giving some indication of depth perception.<ref name="Rodkey, N, E. (2015)"/>[[File:NIH visual cliff experiment (cropped).png|thumb|Visual cliff used with human infants]]

At the time the visual cliff study had initially been designed, Gibson had been researching with a professor at Cornell, Richard Walk.<ref name="Rodkey, N, E. (2015)" /> Walk & Gibson were examining the development of rats and how this was influenced by their rearing environments.<ref name="Rodkey, N, E. (2015)" /> Walk & Gibson included dark-reared rats in their experiment, whose raising was extremely time-consuming.<ref name="Rodkey, N, E. (2015)" /> A combination of 1) wanting to get the most use out of the rats along with, 2) inspiration from both Eleanor's experience with the goats and a similar previous experiment done by Lashley & Russell in 1934,<ref name="Lashley, K. S., Russel, J. T. (1934)">Lashley, K. S., Russel, J. T. (1934). The mechanism of vision. XI. A preliminary test of innate organization. ''Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 45'', 136-144.</ref> produced the idea of studying depth perception with the visual cliff.<ref name="Rodkey, N, E. (2015)" />

Walk & Gibson studied visual depth perception in rats, chickens, turtles, lambs, baby goats, pigs, dogs, cats, and monkeys.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960">Gibson, E. J., & Walk, R. D. (1960). The “visual cliff”. ''Scientific American, 202''(4), 64-71. doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0460-64</ref> In the original study with rats, the apparatus was made of two sheets of glass standing “parallel to the floor and 53 inches above it” with a thin board along the middle.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> The rats were either placed into the experimental group with the shallow and deep side or a control group having no deep side, only shallow.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> The results of the study demonstrated that the rats in the experimental group spent the majority of their time on the shallow side while the rats in the control condition did not show a preference.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> A follow-up study was then conducted with an apparatus having both deep sides with no shallow, along with the same control condition.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> The results of the follow-up study demonstrated that majority of the rats stayed on the center board and those that did not took longer to walk onto the glass than did rats in the control condition.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> Gibson then used a larger apparatus to test chickens, turtles, lambs, kids (baby goats), pigs, dogs, cats, and monkeys; all showing similar results.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" />

Walk & Gibson further experimented with dark-reared vs. light-reared rats to determine whether the depth perception found previously was innate.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> The results were similar.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> This indicated the possibility that depth perception was inherent in all animals.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> However, when tested with cats, this result was not found.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> This demonstrated the belief that depth perception is innate in some species while in others (such as cats), they must learn depth perception.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" />

Finally, Walk & Gibson examined visual depth perception in human infants with a larger apparatus.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> The infants ranged from 6 months old to 14 months old.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> Each child was placed on the center board with his or her mother standing on either the shallow side or the deep side, attempting to motivate the child to crawl toward the mother.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> The results demonstrated that the majority (approximately 90%) of the infants would crawl onto the shallow side but only approximately 10% would crawl onto the deep side.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> It was observed that the infants who refused to crawl onto the deep side would either crawl away from their mother when she was standing on that side or would cry.<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" /> These results suggest that “the average human infant discriminates depth as soon as it can crawl.”<ref name="Gibson & Walk 1960" />

During the annual meeting of the APA in [[Washington, D.C.]], it was announced that Eleanor Gibson was the recipient of the Psychological Science Gold Medal Award. The Gold Medal Awards were given to American psychologists over the age of 65, whom resided in North America.<ref name=":1" /> Gibson was recognized for her distinguished and lifelong record of accomplishments in the areas of professional, scientific, and public interest, which ultimately landed her a golden medallion and a cheque for two thousand dollars. With her scientific findings, they continues to advance the knowledge of perception to this day.<ref name=":1" />

Gibson was among ten psychologists who received the National Medal of Science which was presented by the president, [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992.<ref name="Eppler, M. (2006)" /> After 30 years of establishment, the National Medal of Science had been awarded to 304 receivers where Gibson was one of the ten psychologists that received it.<ref name="“Benjafield_2015”" /> Gibson will be remembered for her Visual Cliff Study, which is currently being taught in undergraduate programs.

=== Commemoration ===
At the age of 92, Gibson died on December 30th, 2002. She was an experimental psychologist who significantly contributed to the many fields of psychology including perception, infant development, and reading.<ref name="Observer (2003)">In appreciation: Eleanor Gibson. (2003, April). ''Observer, 16''(4). <nowiki>https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer</nowiki></ref> In 1949, she worked as a researcher in the department of psychology at Cornell University. Gibson was then appointed professor in 1966, where she became the first woman to hold an endowed professorship at Cornell. Six years later, she was named the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Psychology.<ref name="Observer (2003)" />

Gibson not only left an impact on the field of psychology but also an impact on the people she interacted with. Arlene Walker-Andrews, an associate provost and emeritus professor of psychology at the [[University of Montana]], was one of Gibson's students at Cornell.<ref>Department of Psychology. (2015). <nowiki>http://hs.umt.edu/psychology/faculty/default.php?s=Walker-Andrews</nowiki></ref> Gibson provided her with an opportunity to be a part of her research one month into the school year. Arlene was part of a team of graduate researchers, whom were all brand new students but Jackie never failed to give them full credit.<ref name="Observer (2003)" /> Arlene viewed her as a "gifted mentor" and spoke on her generosity, flexibility, and willingness. She never undervalued the graduate students and always treated them like independent scholars. In appreciation of Gibson, Arlene noted that she was an outstanding model with her work ethic, determination, raw intellect, and dedication to the growth and development of students.<ref name="Observer (2003)" />
