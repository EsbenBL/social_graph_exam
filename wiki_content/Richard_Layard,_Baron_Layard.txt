'''Peter Richard Grenville Layard, Baron Layard''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 15 March 1934) is a British labour economist, currently working as programme director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics.

Layard was Senior Research Officer for the [[Robbins Committee]] on Higher Education. His work on mental health, including publishing The Depression Report in 2006, led to the establishment of the [[Improving Access to Psychological Therapies]] (IAPT) programme in England. He is co-editor of the [[World Happiness Report]], with [[John F. Helliwell]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]].<ref>http://www.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/Sachs%20Writing/2012/World%20Happiness%20Report.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref>

==Family and education==
Peter Richard Grenville Layard is the son of [[John Layard]] and his wife Doris. He was educated at [[Eton College]], where he was a [[King's Scholarship|King's scholar]]; at [[King's College, Cambridge]]; and at the [[London School of Economics]].

==Work==
Layard assisted [[Claus Moser]] on the [[Robbins enquiry]], and later developed a reputation in the [[economics of education]] (with [[Mark Blaug]] at LSE), and [[labour economics]] (in particular with [[Stephen Nickell]]). He advocated many of the policies which characterised the [[New Labour]] government, particularly the [[New Deal (United Kingdom)|New Deal]], partly by founding the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. One approach he took is based on the idea of welfare-to-work, where social welfare payments are structured in a way that encourages (or forces) recipients back into the job market.

As well as academic positions, Layard worked as an advisor for numerous organisations, including government institutions in the United Kingdom and Russia.

In 1990 he was founder-director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. where he is presently programme director.

===Happiness and wellbeing===

Layard became active in the study of what has since come to be known as [[happiness economics]]. This branch of economic analysis starts from the argument that income is a bad approximation for happiness. Based on modern happiness research, he cites three factors that economists fail to take into consideration:

* Social comparisons: In contrast to what traditional economics predicts, happiness is derived from relative income as well as from absolute income. That is, if everyone gains purchasing power, some may still turn out unhappier if their position compared to others is worse. This effect may not turn economic growth into a [[zero-sum game]] entirely, but it will likely diminish the benefits people draw from their hard work. In an economy where not only companies, but individuals are constantly forced to compete with each other, life and work are experienced as a [[rat race]].
* Adaptation: As people get used to higher income levels, their idea of a sufficient income grows with their income. If they fail to anticipate that effect, they will invest more time for work than is good for their happiness. 
* Changing tastes: Economists assume that individual preferences are constant, when in fact such preferences are not fixed but increasingly mutable, shifting constantly according to the latest trends and cultural norms. In turn, the relative values of one's accumulated possessions are subject to depreciation, ultimately having a negative effect on happiness.

From these observations, Layard concludes that taxes serve another purpose besides paying for [[public services]] (usually for [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s) and redistributing income. The third purpose is to counteract the [[cognitive bias]] that causes people to work more than is good for their happiness. That is, taxes should help citizens preserve a healthy [[work-life balance]].

In 2005 Layard published the book ''Happiness: Lessons from a New Science'', in which he emphasised the importance of non-income variables on aggregate happiness. His book summarises the prior empirical findings produced by economists such as Richard Easterlin, David G Blanchflower, Andrew E Clark, Rafael Di Tella, Robert MacCulloch, and Andrew Oswald. In particular he stressed the role of mental health and argued that psychological treatments ought to be much more widely available.

Subsequent books have included ''Happiness: Lessons from a new science'' (2011),<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Happiness-Lessons-New-Science-Second-ebook/dp/B004TRQAS6/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521575888&sr=1-3&keywords=richard+layard|title=Happiness: Lessons from a New Science|date=7 April 2011}}</ref> ''The Origins of Happiness'' (2018),<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Origins-Happiness-Science-Well-Being-Course/dp/0691177899/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521575888&sr=1-1&keywords=richard+layard {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref> and ''Can We Be Happier?: Evidence and Ethics'' (2020).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07Z4821Z7/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0|title=Can We be Happier?: Evidence and Ethics|date=23 January 2020}}</ref>

In 2012 he co-edited, with [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and John Helliwell, the [[World Happiness Report]], and has been involved in subsequent years.<ref>http://www.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/Sachs%20Writing/2012/World%20Happiness%20Report.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref>

Layard co-founded [[Action for Happiness]] in 2010, and continues on the board.

In 2014, with the clinical psychologist [[David M.

Layard has shown that mental illness<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Layard |first1=Richard |title=The economics of mental health |year=2016 |url=https://wol.iza.org/articles/economics-of-mental-health |journal=IZA World of Labor |issue=321 |doi=10.15185/izawol.321 |access-date=2 May 2021|hdl=10419/162333 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> is the main cause of unhappiness.<ref>Happiness: Lessons from a new science, 2011, https://www.amazon.co.uk/Happiness-Lessons-New-Science-Second-ebook/dp/B004TRQAS6/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521575888&sr=1-3&keywords=richard+layard</ref>

===Development===

In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the [[Global Apollo Programme]], which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make [[Renewable energy|carbon-free]] [[Base load power plant|baseload electricity]] less costly than [[Fossil fuel power station|electricity from coal]] by the year 2025.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Carrington|first1=Damian|title=Global Apollo programme seeks to make clean energy cheaper than coal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/apollo-programme-for-clean-energy-needed-to-tackle-climate-change|access-date=2 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|issue=2 June 2015|publisher=[[Guardian News Media]]}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Layard was made a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[life peer]] in the [[House of Lords]] on 3 May 2000 as '''Baron Layard''', of [[Highgate]] in the [[London Borough of Haringey]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55840 |date=8 May 2000 |page=5023}}</ref>

In 1991, he married [[Molly Meacher, Baroness Meacher|Molly Christine Meacher]], who was formerly married to [[Michael Meacher]]. Molly, styled Lady Layard between 2000 and 2006, was herself created a [[life peer]] in 2006 as Baroness Meacher. They are one of the few couples to both hold titles in their own right.

Layard has said he was strongly Christian at school, lost his faith at university, and in his later years 'has to be believe there is some purpose in the universe... which gives me comfort.'<ref>"Richard Layard's Confessions — History, happiness and mental health", interview with Giles Fraser, January 2020, https://soundcloud.com/unherd-confessions/richard-layards-confessions</ref>

==Honours==
In 2003, Layard was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA).<ref name="FBA">{{cite web|title=Professor Lord (Richard) Layard of Highgate|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/user/2085|website=British Academy|access-date=5 August 2017}}</ref> In 2016, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences]] (FAcSS).<ref>{{cite web|title=Eighty-four leading social scientists conferred as Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences|url=https://www.acss.org.uk/news/eighty-four-leading-social-scientists-conferred-fellows-academy-social-sciences/|website=Academy of Social Sciences|access-date=5 August 2017|date=19 October 2016}}</ref>
