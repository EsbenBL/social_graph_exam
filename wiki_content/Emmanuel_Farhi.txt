== Education ==
The son of an economist of Egyptian Jewish descent, Farhi grew up in Paris where he attended the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. At age 16 he won the [[Concours général]] in Physics and continued on to study Mathematics in [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|preparatory class]]. Ranking 1st on the national entry exam to the elite engineering school [[École Polytechnique]] in 1997,<ref name="X">{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000387136&dateTexte=|title=Arrêté du 25 septembre 1997 portant nomination des élèves admis en 1997 à l'Ecole polytechnique &#124; Legifrance}}</ref> he eventually chose to attend another prestigious French graduate school, [[École Normale Supérieure]].<ref>[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/leading-harvard-economist-emmanuel-farhi-dies-at-41/], ''Former adviser to French prime minister known for his brilliance and kindness.'' The Harvard Gazette.</ref> He specialized in Mathematics obtaining 2nd place on the Agrégation de Mathematiques (French degree). He was then admitted to the [[Corps des mines|Corps des Mines]] in 2001.

He finished his studies at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and was awarded a Ph.D. in 2006.<ref name="CV" /> That same year he began working at Harvard as assistant professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. He received tenure four years later when he was named a full professor.<ref>[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/leading-harvard-economist-emmanuel-farhi-dies-at-41/], ''Former adviser to French prime minister known for his brilliance and kindness.'' The Harvard Gazette.</ref>

== Career ==
Farhi started his career in the Economics department of Harvard in 2006<ref name="CV" /> and was tenured in 2010.<ref name="Tenure">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/5/12/tenure-gopinath-department-professors/|title=Economics Professor Emmanuel Farhi Awarded Tenure &#124; News &#124; The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com}}</ref> One of the leading economists of his generation both in the U.S. and in France, Farhi’s research focused on macroeconomics and finance, specifically on financial stability and reforming the international monetary system. A former economic adviser to French Prime Minister François Fillon, the International Monetary Fund named Farhi one of the 25 best economists under 45 in 2014. 

Though highly quantitative, his work shed light on practical issues such as [[macroprudential regulation]], mitigating the impacts of economic crises or understanding the implications of fiscal policies. For example, he assessed the controversial [[Social VAT]],<ref name="TVA">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/10/24/pour-une-devaluation-fiscale_1780211_3232.html|title=Pour une dévaluation fiscale}}</ref> a measure introduced by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and repealed by his successor [[Francois Hollande]] only to reemerge under a different form: the "Competitiveness Pact". Farhi’s work cast a spotlight on a range of issues, including monetary economics, public finance, international economics, global imbalances, fiscal policy, and taxation. He also focused on issues like mitigating the impacts of economic crises and macroprudential regulation, a system used to describe the laws, rules, and conditions for banks and financial organizations that are meant to protect the whole financial system from risk.<ref>[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/leading-harvard-economist-emmanuel-farhi-dies-at-41/ ''Former adviser to French prime minister known for his brilliance and kindness.'']</ref>
