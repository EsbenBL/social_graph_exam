'''Helmut Heinrich Waldemar Schmidt''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛlmuːt ˈʃmɪt|-|De-Helmut Schmidt.ogg}}; 23 December 1918 – 10 November 2015) was a German politician and member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), who served as the [[chancellor of West Germany]] from 1974 to 1982.

Before becoming Chancellor, he was the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|minister of Defence]] (1969–1972) and as the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|minister of Finance]] (1972–1974) in the government of [[Willy Brandt]]. In the latter role he gained credit for his financial policies. He had also briefly been Minister of Economics and as acting Foreign Minister. As Chancellor, he focused on international affairs, seeking "political unification of Europe in partnership with the United States" and issuing proposals that led to the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] in 1979 to deploy US [[Pershing II]] missiles to Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Max Otte|author2=Jürgen Greve|title=A Rising Middle Power?: German Foreign Policy in Transformation, 1989–1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqoJL6yuSqwC&pg=PA38|year=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=38|isbn=978-0-312-22653-4}}</ref> He was an energetic diplomat who sought European co-operation and international economic co-ordination and was the leading force in creating the [[European Monetary System]] in 1978. He was re-elected chancellor in 1976 and 1980, but his coalition fell apart in 1982 with the switch by his coalition allies, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]].

He retired from Parliament in 1986, after clashing with the SPD's left wing, who opposed him on defence and economic issues. In 1986 he was a leading proponent of [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|European monetary union]] and a [[European Central Bank]].

== Background, family, early life and education ==

Helmut Schmidt was born as the elder of two sons of teachers Ludovica Koch (10 November 1890 – 29 November 1968) and Gustav Ludwig Schmidt (18 April 1888 – 26 March 1981) in [[Barmbek]], a working-class district of [[Hamburg]], in 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/royal/laborde.html |title=Ancestry of Henri de Laborde de Monpezat |publisher=Wargs |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> Schmidt studied at Hamburg Lichtwark School, graduating in 1937.<ref name=lemo>{{cite web|title=Helmut Schmidt geb. 1918|url=https://www.hdg.de/lemo/biografie/helmut-schmidt.html|website=Lebendiges Museum Online|publisher=Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland|access-date=10 November 2015|language=de}}</ref> Schmidt's father was born the biological son of a [[German Jew]]ish banker, Ludwig Gumpel, and a Christian waitress, Friederike Wenzel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/spiegelspecial/d-28731611.html|title=Sachbücher: Kleiner, großer Mann mit Mütze|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date=10 November 2015}}</ref> and then covertly adopted, although this was kept a family secret for many years.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lehrer | first = Steven | title = Wannsee house and the Holocaust| year = 2000| publisher = McFarland| isbn =978-0-7864-0792-7| page = 74}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Told French President of Jewish Origins – Helmut Schmidt's Revelation Reported | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-25/news/mn-45342_1_jewish-origins | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 25 February 1988 | access-date = 25 September 2009 }}</ref> This was confirmed publicly by Schmidt in 1984, after [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] revealed the fact to journalists, apparently with Schmidt's assent.

Schmidt planned to study without interruption, therefore [[Military volunteer|volunteered]] at age 18 for military service in 1937. He began serving with an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] battery of [[Luftwaffe]] at [[Vegesack]] near [[Bremen]]. In [[World War II]], after brief service on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941 (including the [[Siege of Leningrad]]), he returned to Germany in 1942 to work as a trainer and advisor at the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|Ministry of Aviation]].<ref name=lemo/> During his service in World War II, Schmidt was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hsb.ub.hsu-hh.de/free/530569175.pdf | title = Verleihung der Ehrendoktorwürde der Johns-Hopkins-Universität; Laudatio verlesen von Harry W o o l f bei der Überreichung des Grades eines Doktors der Rechtswissenschaften an Bundeskanzler Helmut Schmidt am 16.

Aufl|location=Berlin|oclc=244654452}}</ref>

== Early years post-Second World War==

Schmidt joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in 1946, and from 1947-48 was the leader of the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student League]], the student organisation of the SPD. Upon graduating from the [[University of Hamburg]], where he read Economics, he worked for the government of the city-state of Hamburg, working in the department of Economic Policy. Beginning in 1952, under [[Karl Schiller]], he was a senior figure heading up the ''Behörde für Wirtschaft und Verkehr'' (the Hamburg State Ministry for Economy and Transport).<ref name=lemo/>

He was elected to the ''Bundestag'' in 1953, and in 1957 he became a member of the SPD parliamentary party executive. A vocal critic of conservative government policy, his outspoken rhetoric in parliament earned him the nickname ''Schmidt-Schnauze'' ("Schmidt the Lip").<ref>The German word ''Schnauze'' designates the mouth and nose area of an animal like a dog or a wolf; so the epithet indicates a ready wit and a sharp tongue, suitable for (metaphorically) tearing his opponents' arguments to pieces. In the early years of the Bundestag, it was commonplace to announce a speaker's name followed by his or her electoral district, so ''Schmidt-Schnauze'' is also interpreted as a play on words.</ref> In 1958, he joined the national board of the SPD (''Bundesvorstand''), and campaigned against [[nuclear weapon]]s and the equipping of the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' with such devices. He alarmed some in his party by taking part in manoeuvres as a reserve officer in the newly formed Bundeswehr. In 1962, he gave up his seat in parliament to concentrate on his tasks in Hamburg.<ref name=lemo/>

== Senator ==

The government of the city-state of Hamburg is known as the [[Senate of Hamburg]], and from 1961 to 1965, Schmidt was the ''Innensenator'': the senator of the interior.<ref name=lemo/> He gained a reputation as a ''Macher'' (doer) – someone who gets things done regardless of obstacles – by his effective management during the emergency caused by the [[North Sea flood of 1962|1962 flood]], during which 300 people drowned. Schmidt used all means at his disposal to alleviate the situation, even when that meant overstepping his legal authority, including employing the [[German Federal Police|federal police]] and army units (ignoring the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]'s prohibition on using the army for "internal affairs"; a clause excluding disasters was not added until 1968). Describing his actions, Schmidt said, "I wasn't put in charge of these units – I took charge of them!"<ref>{{cite news|title=Herr der Flut|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-32655070.html|access-date=10 November 2015|work=Der Spiegel|issue=10/1962|date=7 March 1982|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Bahnsen|first1=Uwe|title=Als der 'Herr der Flut' 40.000 Retter kommandierte|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/hamburg/article13825421/Als-der-Herr-der-Flut-40-000-Retter-kommandierte.html|work=Die Welt|access-date=10 November 2015|language=de|date=22 January 2012}}</ref> He saved a further 1,000 lives and swiftly managed the re-housing of thousands of the homeless.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

== Return to federal politics ==

In 1965, he was re-elected to the [[Bundestag]]. In 1967, after the formation of the [[Grand Coalition (Germany)|Grand Coalition]] between the SPD and the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), he became chairman of the Social Democratic parliamentary party, a post he held until the elections of 1969. In 1968, he was elected deputy party chairman, a post that he held until 1983. Unlike [[Willy Brandt]] and [[Gerhard Schröder]], he never became chairman of the party.<ref name=lemo/>

In October 1969, he entered the government of Willy Brandt as defense minister.<ref>{{cite news|title=Die Erwartungen sind verdammt hoch: Neue Minister für die Reform-Ressorts|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45520455.html|access-date=10 November 2015|work=Der Spiegel|issue=44/1969|date=27 October 1969|language=de}}</ref> During his term in office, the military [[conscription]] time was reduced from 18 to 15 months, while at the same time increasing the number of young men being conscripted.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Becker|first1=Kurt|title=Wer muß unter die Soldaten?|url=http://www.zeit.de/1971/06/wer-muss-unter-die-soldaten|access-date=10 November 2015|work=Die Zeit|date=5 February 1971|language=de}}</ref> Additionally, Schmidt decided to introduce the [[Bundeswehr]] universities in [[Helmut Schmidt University|Hamburg]] and [[Bundeswehr University Munich|Munich]] to broaden the academic education of the German officer corps, and the situation of non-commissioned officers was improved.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helmut Schmidt|url=http://www.hsu-hh.de/hsu/index_J6ZVOJXUfS44PbZs.html|publisher=Helmut-Schmidt-Universität Hamburg|access-date=10 November 2015|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106223420/http://www.hsu-hh.de/hsu/index_J6ZVOJXUfS44PbZs.html|archive-date=6 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In July 1972, he succeeded [[Karl Schiller]] as Minister for Economics and Finance, but in November 1972, he relinquished the Economics department, which was again made a separate ministry. Schmidt remained Minister of Finance and faced the prospect of rising inflation. Shortly before the Oil Shock of 1973, which rattled Britain and United States, Schmidt agreed that European currencies should be floated against the US Dollar. He remained in charge of finance until May 1974.<ref name=lemo/>

Schmidt became [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany|Chancellor]] of West Germany on 16 May 1974, after Brandt's resignation in the wake of an [[Guillaume Affair|espionage scandal]].

Schmidt was [[1980 West German federal election|re-elected]] as Chancellor in November 1980.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Funk|first1=Albert|title=Wie ein wilder Stier|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/bundestagswahl-historie/serie-bundestagswahlen-1980-wie-ein-wilder-stier/8582662.html|work=Der Tagesspiegel|access-date=10 November 2015|language=de|date=1 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Helmut Schmidt ja, SPD na ja|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14316743.html|access-date=10 November 2015|work=Der Spiegel|issue=41/1980|date=6 October 1980|language=de}}</ref> Concerned about the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and the Soviet superiority regarding missiles in Central Europe, Schmidt issued proposals resulting in the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]], concerning the deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe, should the Soviets not disarm. This decision was unpopular with the German public. A mass demonstration against the deployment mobilised 400,000 people in October 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historische Debatten (9): NATO-Doppelbeschluss|url=https://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/a08/25482592_debatten09/200098|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|access-date=10 November 2015|language=de}}</ref>

At the beginning of his period as chancellor, Schmidt was a proponent of [[Keynesian economics]], and pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies during his tenure. Between 1979-82, the Schmidt administration pursued such policies in an effort to reduce unemployment. These were moderately successful, as the fiscal measures introduced after 1977, with reductions in income and wealth taxes and an increase in the medium-term public investment programme, were estimated to have created 160,000 additional jobs in 1978–79, or 300,000 if additional public sector employment was included in the figure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Robert|last2=Townsend|first2=Peter|last3=Lawson|first3=Roger|title=Responses to Poverty: Lessons from Europe|date=January 1984|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3222-2|pages=163–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXshEyRHrccC&q=Responses+to+poverty:+lessons+from+Europe+by+Robert+Walker |access-date=5 February 2015}}</ref> The small reduction in the unemployment rate, however, was achieved at the cost of a larger budget deficit (which rose from 31.2 billion DM to 75.7 billion DM in 1981), brought about by fiscal expansion.<ref>''Taxation, Wage Bargaining and Unemployment'' by Isabela Mares</ref>

During the 1970s, West Germany was able to weather the [[1973 oil crisis|global financial storm]] far better than almost all the other developed countries, with unemployment and inflation kept at comparatively low levels. During the 1976 election campaign, the SPD/FDP coalition was able to win the battle of statistics, whether the figures related to employees' incomes, strikes, unemployment, growth, or public sector debts. Amongst other social improvements, old age pensions had been doubled between 1969–76, and unemployment benefits increased to 68% of previous earnings.<ref name="autogenerated1">''Germany in the Twentieth Century'' by David Childs</ref>

Whilst visiting Saudi Arabia in April 1981, Schmidt made some unguarded remarks about the Israel-Palestine conflict that succeeded in aggravating the delicate relations between Israel and West Germany. Asked by a reporter about the moral aspect of German-Israeli relations, he stated that Israel was not in a position to criticise Germany due to its handling of Palestinians, and "That won't do. And in particular, it won't do for a German living in a divided nation and laying moral claim to the right of self-determination for the German people. One must then recognize the moral claim of the Palestinian people to the right of self-determination." On 3 May, Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] denounced Schmidt as "unprincipled, avaricious, heartless, and lacking in human feeling", and stated that he had "willingly served in the German armies that murdered millions." Begin was also upset over remarks that Schmidt had made on West German television the previous week, in which he spoke apologetically about the suffering Germany inflicted on various nations during [[World War II]]; but made no mention of the Jews. On his flight home from [[Riyadh]], Schmidt told his advisers that war guilt could not continue to affect Germany's foreign relations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/05/world/begin-rebukes-schmidt-for-remark-on-palestinians.html |title=Begin Rebukes Schmidt for Remark on Palestinians |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 May 1981 }}</ref>

Schmidt was the first world leader to call upon newly elected French president [[François Mitterrand]], who visited [[Bonn]] in July 1981. The two found themselves in "complete agreement" on foreign policy matters and relations with the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], but differed on trade and economic issues.<ref>{{cite news |first=Frank J. |last=Prial |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/13/world/paris-bonn-talks-focus-security-mitterrand-france-chancellor-helmut-schmidt-west.html |title=Paris-Bonn Talks Focus on Security: Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany |newspaper=The New York Times |date=13 July 1981 }}</ref>

By the end of his term, however, Schmidt had turned away from [[deficit spending]], due to a deteriorating economic situation, and a number of welfare cuts were carried out,<ref name="autogenerated2">''Growth to Limits. The Western European Welfare States Since World War II'' by Peter Flora</ref> including smaller increases in child benefits and higher unemployment and health contributions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity |first1=Giles |last1=Radice |first2=Lisanne |last2=Radice |year=1986 |page=129 |isbn=9780333388457 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oekSAQAAMAAJ }}</ref> Large sections of the SPD increasingly opposed his security policy, while most of the FDP politicians strongly supported that policy. While representatives of the left-wing of the Social Democratic Party opposed reduction of the state expenditures, the FDP began proposing a [[monetarism|monetarist]] economic policy. In February 1982, Schmidt won a [[motion of confidence]]; however on 17 September 1982, the coalition broke apart, with the four FDP ministers leaving his cabinet. Schmidt continued to lead a minority government composed only of SPD members, while the FDP negotiated a coalition with the CDU/CSU. During this time, Schmidt also headed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 1 October 1982, parliament approved a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] and elected CDU chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as the new chancellor. This was the only time in the history of the Federal Republic that a chancellor was removed from office in this way.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/webarchiv/textarchiv/2012/40797914_kw40_misstrauensvotum_kalenderblatt-209576 |title=Deutscher Bundestag – Das Misstrauensvotum gegen Helmut Schmidt|first=Jan |last=Eisel |date=28 September 2012 |access-date=10 November 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Schmidt's domestic reforms ==
Although Schmidt did not feel that he was in a position to substantially extend the social reforms of the [[Willy Brandt|Brandt Administration]], due to the economic problems he encountered during his time as chancellor, a wide range of reforms were nevertheless carried out under his administration. Increases were made to [[pensions]], which went up in numerical terms. Adjusted for changes in the annual price index, pensions went up in real terms. However the rate of pension was not changed in 1978 (even though prices increased by 2.7%), and in 1980 and 1981 the real value of pensions fell by 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively.<ref>''The Social Democratic Party of Germany 1848–2005'' by Heinrich Potthoff and [[Susanne Miller]]</ref> Improvements were made in family allowances, with monthly subsidies for children increased by over 100% in 1975.<ref name="autogenerated3">''Taxation, wage bargaining and unemployment'' by Isabela Mares</ref>

Improvements were made to invalidity and old-age pension provision for the unemployed, who (from 1977 onwards) were technically insured free of charge under the old-age pension and invalidity scheme. Previously, there had only existed partial and restricted coverage for the unemployed.<ref name="walker1">''Responses to poverty: lessons from Europe'' by Robert Walker, Roger Lawson, and Peter Townsend</ref> The Law to Improve Occupational Old Age Pensions (1974) extended coverage of occupational pensions, whilst also "co-ordinating them more closely with state pensions and setting minimum standards as regards benefit levels and the preservation of pension rights". By 1976, as a result of this legislation, 65% of private sector employees were covered by occupational schemes, and over two-thirds of these workers were eligible for benefits equal to more than 15% of their earnings at retirement.<ref name="walker1" /> This legislation also acquired that entitlements to occupational pensions must not expire after leaving a firm, and that occupational pensions must not be reduced as a result of receipt of benefits under the public insurance system. The Social Insurance Law for the Handicapped (1975) extended compulsory coverage to handicapped persons working in special establishments for the disabled (medical benefits and cash benefits to replace earnings from work).<ref name="autogenerated2" /> In 1976, a new declaration of social rights was made,<ref name="autogenerated4">''Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity'' by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice</ref> and in 1979, an Act was passed which lowered the pensionable age for severely handicapped persons to 61 years, and to 60 years as from 1980.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRlfyus2mgwC&pg=PA51 |title=Changing Patterns of Social Protection |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>

In October 1974, a Rehabilitation Benefits Alignment Act was passed, with the intention of promoting rehabilitation of the handicapped by extending certain benefits to them.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gl0tzPYgko8C&pg=PA435 |title=Industrial Relations|date=1 October 1974 |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> To meet the need for more uniform medical treatment in rural areas and on the peripheral of cities due to a lack of panel doctors in those areas, a bill was passed in December 1976 which improved the possibilities of panel doctors' associations by ensuring that panel doctors were available to provide treatment, while also providing for planning according to need and the participation of the sickness insurances. An Act of August 1975 on criminal law reform introduced "other forms of assistance" such as medical advice on contraception, together with assistance pertaining to sterilisation and abortion.<ref>''The Evolution of Social Insurance 1881–1981: Studies of Germany, France, Great Britain, Austria, and Switzerland'' edited by Peter A.

In July 1974, special benefits were introduced to compensate for wages not paid as a result of bankruptcy for a maximum of up three months. Increases in income-limits for housing allowances were carried out, together with housing allowance rates, while major improvements were made in welfare provision for the elderly.<ref>''The rise and decline of the state'' by Martin Van Creveld</ref> By 1982, the purchasing power of the average pension was 2.5% better than in 1975.<ref name="auto1"/> In 1975, tax allowances were replaced by child benefits, while payment for the first child was introduced.<ref name="autogenerated4"/> A tax relief act reduced income taxes and provided additional tax benefits for housing allowances.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> The Schmidt administration also introduced social policy legislation in the late 1970s, which increased family allowances (though by a smaller amount than in 1974) and maternity leave benefits.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> The increases in benefits under the Schmidt administration arguably had a positive impact on reducing inequalities, with the percentage of West Germans living in poverty (according to one measurement) falling between 1978 and 1982.<ref>[http://www.lisproject.org/publications/liswps/148.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123223222/http://www.lisproject.org/publications/liswps/148.pdf |date=23 November 2012 }}</ref>

Under the law of June 1974, the residents could participate in the management of the establishment through a consultative committee.<ref name="pitt.edu">http://aei.pitt.edu/9842/1/9842.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref> A law of June 1975 amended the Employment Protection Law and the Law on the provision of temporary workers which improved the legal protection of temporary migrants workers in West Germany. A law of December 1975 gave the right to claim under the sickness insurance scheme for medical consultations for family planning purposes. A law of May 1975 extended social security to handicapped persons according to various procedures.<ref name="aei.pitt.edu" />

== Socialist measures for Youth and Unemployment ==
A law of April 1976 on youth employment limited working hours to 40 hours in a 5-day week, raised the minimum working age from 14 to 15, increased leave, improved conditions for release from work for day attendance at vocational training school and for periods of weeks under the block release system, and improved protection at work by restrictions on employment in dangerous or unhealthy work. The general section of the Social Code, which came into effect in January 1976, introduced basic measures concerning the social services. It laid down an obligation to establish the services and institutions needed by the population and to provide them with information and advice on their social rights. These provisions had already had certain effects, in particular a considerable growth in home help services and social centres. A regulation in application of a 1974 law on old people's homes and adult hostels was introduced, according to which compulsory consultative committees could be set up by the residents to ensure their participation in the running of these establishments in a greater measure than in the past.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://aei.pitt.edu/9819/1/9819.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref> A law passed in August 1974 supplemented the protection provided for handicapped people, under a law passed during the Brandt Administration in April 1974, by providing that, henceforth, the benefits for the purposes of medical and occupational rehabilitation would be the same for all the categories of persons concerned: war victims, the sick, the victims of industrial accidents, congenitally handicapped persons: a total of about 4 million persons in all.<ref name="pitt.edu"/>

Various measures were also carried out to mitigate the effects of unemployment. Employment creation schemes were introduced to help young workers. The Training Opportunities Act (1976) helped (over a four-year period) to increase the number of vocational training places from 450,000 to 630,000 a year.<ref name="autogenerated4" /> In 1976, a provisional law was introduced to boost the number of apprentices, which reduced the numbers of young people out of work. An experimental retraining programme was launched on the shop floor (lasting from 1979 to 1981), which benefited 45,680 people.<ref name="walker1" />

A special programme was introduced, specially designed for young people who, because of their poor level of education and language ability, were unable to find a suitable job or training place. The young people were offered a one-year full-time course of training to qualify them for a training place or job, and in September 1980, approximately 15,000 young people were participating in these courses. From 1980 onwards, parents could deduct the cost of day care for their children (in day nurseries and nursery schools in particular) from their taxable income up to an annual maximum of DM 600 or DM 1,200, depending on whether the income of a single parent or that of a married couple was involved. Major additions were also made to the regulations on dangerous substances, while comprehensive new regulations concerning installations requiring supervision were introduced. The Federal Ministry for Youth, Family Affairs and Health gave particular attention to assisting parents in assuming their educational responsibilities towards their children. For instance, special 'letters to parents' were distributed free of charge to parents of children under 8, with some 3 million sent in 1979. A determined effort was also made to provide better education for socially disadvantaged children by supporting pilot schemes and research projects. Public funds had been allocated from 1979 onwards to a pilot scheme entitled 'Aid to children in need' under which children's communities were set up in Berlin and Giitersloh to protect and care for children who had been or were at risk of being ill-treated by their parents, while at the same time the family education and advisory services were assigned the task of educating these parents.<ref name=aei9816 />

=== Enshrining constitutional rights for workers ===
The Fifth Amendment of July 1979 to the Employment Promotion Law provided, among other measures, for an improvement in conditions governing financial support towards basic vocational training for unemployed young people with at least one year's vocational experience, the expansion of training activities for jobs in which there is a shortage of skilled workers and easier access to further vocational training facilities for problem groups (such as the unskilled, the unemployed, and women generally). In 1979, the Federal Minister for Education and Science made funds available for a new further education establishment to train instructors. Under a law amending the law respecting technical working media and the Industrial Code of August 1979, machines and equipment which had been voluntarily submitted for testing and passed by an established body may bear the marking 'GS' (=safety-tested). For medical equipment, the Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs was authorized to issue orders containing further safety provisions, while the resale of hazardous equipment and its display at exhibitions may be prohibited in future by factory inspectors even in the case of trading companies.<ref name=aei9816>http://aei.pitt.edu/9816/1/9816.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref>

=== Urban housing developments ===
The 1976 Act for the Promotion of Urban Development and the 1977 Housing Modernisation Act, together with the 1971 Act for the Promotion of Urban Development passed by the Brandt Administration, enabled most West German cities by the end of the 1970s to introduce programmes aimed at renovating their pre-war residential areas.<ref>''Urban and rural change in West Germany'' by Martin Trevor Wild</ref> Additional tax reforms were introduced that lowered the tax burden on low-income households, and which played an important role "in pre-empting a real decline in the income and purchasing power of workers".<ref name="autogenerated3" /> A law was passed to encourage low-income home ownership,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniknet.de/daly_de.0.html?year=1975&month=4&day=10 |title=10.04.1975 – Präsident Gerald Ford Rede Kongress Washington 722 Mio|publisher=Chroniknet.de |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> while 250 million marks was provided in 1978 for the promotion of sports and physical education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniknet.de/daly_de.0.html?year=1978&month=8 |title=August 1978 – Oberste Gericht DDR Berufungsantrag Regimekritikers Rudolf Bahro Verurteilung|publisher=Chroniknet.de |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> That same year, entitlement to educational allowances was extended to all tenth-grade pupils in vocational education.<ref name="walker1" /> In 1979, DM 219 million was set aside for about 80,000 dwellings under the modernisation programme for dwellings worthy of preservation run jointly by the Federal authorities and the individual Lander (50% of this money was earmarked for modernization priority areas). In addition, DM 2,350 million was made available under a five-year programme to improve the housing stock. Loans and higher tax rebates were also used to encourage modernisation of dwellings and energy-saving measures. 577 slum clearance and urban development schemes in 459 municipalities were also accorded financial support amounting to DM 183.5 million, under a law on the promotion of urban development. A law of October 1979 granted a lump-sum allowance for the winter of 1979/80 to help low-income groups to meet the additional outlay incurred by the rise in fuel costs. In August 1979, a programme was adopted for foreign refugees, with resources allocated for aid concerning information, legal advice, psycho-social and medical assistance and for measures to facilitate the integration of refugees or their emigration to other countries.<ref name=aei9816 /> In 1981, DM 340 million were set aside for subsidies and DM 148 million for low-interest loans, which enabled financial assistance to be granted towards the modernization of some 80 000 dwellings.

=== Industrial compliance standards ===

An amendment to a law of September 1980 on air traffic, adopted in January 1981, prohibited the transport of radioactive substances by air without a special permit.<ref>http://aei.pitt.edu/9809/1/9809.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref> Existing safety regulations were considerably extended and modified by the technical committees responsible for individual specialist areas. Regarding installations requiring supervision, the technical regulations for pressure containers (19 January 1982) and steam boilers (26 January 18 March and 8 June 1982) were extended and revised, with their most important provisions concerning the oil- and gas-firing of steam boilers. A Directive on connecting lines designed to carry dangerous fluids (11 June 1982) was issued, together with technical regulations on pressure gases (11 June and 9 July 1982) The existing technical regulations on flammable fluids were also modified and by means of new regulations and directives extended (19 April 1982). Other modifications were made to the technical regulations on high-pressure gas pipelines (22 June and 10 September 1982) and on installations where acetylene is present and calcium carbide is stored (30 September 1982), while new recommended levels for dangerous working substances were incorporated into the regulations governing these substances (10 May 1982).<ref>http://aei.pitt.edu/9822/1/9822.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref>

=== Workers' pension reform ===

The Introductory Tax Reform Law (1974) increased bad weather payments, part-time workers' benefits and insurance benefits to 68% of net wages, fixed special benefits during vocational training at 90% of net earnings, increased assistance benefits to 58% of net earnings, and abolished special family benefits "in favour of the inclusion of the unemployed under general child allowance scheme".<ref name="walker1"/> A special tax credit was introduced in 1978 in cases of particular financial burden due to children,<ref name="autogenerated2" /> while a substantial increase in the child allowance was made in 1979.<ref>''Below-Replacement Fertility in Industrial Societies: Causes, Consequences, Policies'', edited by Kingsley Davis, Mikhail S. Bernstam, and Rita Ricardo-Campbell</ref> Several policy changes were carried out between 1976 and 1982, such as tax credits and family allowances, which compensated unions for [[incomes policy|wage restraint]] and "guaranteed the maintenance of a constant income level for employed persons and their families".<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Increases were made in child benefits, which rose on a regular basis (particularly for families with more than one child) for most of the years that the Schmidt Administration was in office.<ref name="walker1" />

In terms of workplace rights, a "parity" system was introduced (although in a weakened form) on the supervisory boards of all companies employing over 2,000 workers, a reform which West German trade unions had long fought for.<ref name="autogenerated4" /> This law improved employee representation on the supervisory boards of companies outside the steel and coal industries. The main provision of this new piece of legislation was that in the 650 major companies that accounted for 70% of West Germany's output, employee representation on the supervisory boards rose from one-third to one-half.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In 1976, the Young Persons (Protection of Employment) Act was passed, which forbade the employment of children and young persons required to attend full-time education, with minor exceptions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tERFy1q6okC&pg=PA63 |title=Recent Developments in the Clothing Industry: Fourth Tripartite Technical ...|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>

=== Product liability and consumer protection ===
In June 1974, a reformed food law was passed into law, which aimed to safeguard consumers from physical harm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sophienschule.de/comenius/timeline/index_files/Ger74economy.htm |title=Germany '74 – Economy |publisher=Sophienschule.de |date=20 December 1974 |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> The Students' Sickness Insurance Law (1975) extended compulsory coverage to students (medical benefits only), while the Artists' Social Insurance Law (1981) introduced compulsory insurance for artists below a certain income-limit.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> The Detergents Law (1975) and the Effluency Levies Act (1978) were passed to encourage environmental protection.<ref>''Germany, 2000 Years: From the Nazi era to German unification'' by Kurt Frank Reinhardt, Gerhart Hoffmeister, and Frederic Christian Tubach</ref> In 1975, the allowable duration of unemployment benefit payment was extended to 24 months during periods of general recession.<ref>http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11255.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref> The 1976 law on standard terms of sale gave consumer groups the right to file suits against companies employing unfair terms of sale.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCv4K6D_8MwC&pg=PA63 |title=Consumer Capitalism: Politics, Product Markets, And Firm Strategy in France ... – Gunnar Trumbull|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> The Higher Education Framework Act of 1976 pronounced that scientific continuing education was a task to be implemented by the institutions of the system of higher education, thus exceeding their traditional tasks of research and lecturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paginas.fe.up.pt/nuce/GERM.html |title=Ulrike Kommer |publisher=Paginas.fe.up.pt |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> In 1977, an "investment programme for the future" was decided upon by the Schmidt Administration, which provided DM 16 thousand million for the improvement of the transport system, an efficient and ecological energy supply, provisions for water supply, vocational training, and the safeguarding of the environment.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCHq-Fgjci4C&pg=RA1-PA204 |title=The German Economy in the Twentieth Century: The German Reich and the ... – Hans-Joachim Braun|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>

=== What was the meaning of social protection? ===
The social protection of civil servants and judges (Bund and Lander) was standardised and improved by a law of August 1974. Under a law of May 1976, victims of acts of violence and their survivors would in future have the right to compensation in respect of the physical and economic consequences in the same manner as protection for war victims.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> In 1977, DM 8 million was made available by the federal government to welfare bodies to build and modernise holiday homes for families. That same year, the conditions for investment in the privately financed construction of rented dwellings were improved by the reintroduction of decreasing depreciation for buildings. In order to take the situation of the unemployed into account to the maximum possible extent in asset formation policy, certain legal provisions were amended so that in the event of unemployment, personal payments could be made to continue savings plans which entailed employers contributions. In addition, workers who had been unemployed for a year or more could unblock savings plans before the end of the freeze without losing the financial benefits offered by the State.<ref name="ReferenceB">http://aei.pitt.edu/10246/1/10246.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref> A new special programme with funds of DM 100 million was launched at the start of 1978 to improve training and job opportunities for the handicapped. The budget of the Federal Labour Office was increased exceptionally by more than 20%, whilst special emphasis was placed on measures to promote vocational training, job creation, advanced training and retraining. The aim was to reduce the high proportion of unemployed persons lacking training and increase the chances of this group to obtain employment.

Under a regulation of December 1976, four new occupational diseases were recognised.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> To expand training opportunities for girls, a pilot scheme was launched in 1978 to open up certain skilled industrial and technical occupations to them.<ref name="ReferenceC">http://aei.pitt.edu/10248/1/10248.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref> Laws restricting the access of migrant workers to certain regions were repealed in 1977, and the existing provisions were made more flexible in order to allow the children of migrant workers who had entered the Federal Republic of Germany in 1975/76 access to employment.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> Legislation governing old people's homes and adult assistance establishments was further supplemented by two regulations, one imposing minimum requirements concerning premises, and the other laying down rules for financial management to ensure that residents were not financially exploited.<ref name="ReferenceC" />

Under a law of July 1980, a farmer's surviving spouse wishing to continue working on the farm could obtain a helper or temporary aid from the agricultural pension fund. Any spouse choosing not to do so was entitled to a survivor's allowance if he or she was no longer able to find suitable paid employment either for reasons of age (over 45) or because there were children to bring up. In other cases, the allowance was designed to facilitate reintegration into working life. This allowance guaranteed the spouse protection under the agricultural sickness insurance scheme, which also covered self-employed fishermen and beekeepers.<ref name=aei9813>http://aei.pitt.edu/9813/1/9813.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref>

=== Divorce reform ===
A wide range of social liberal reforms were also carried out during Schmidt's time in office. A marriage and divorce law of 1976 instituted the principle of maintenance obligations of each economically stronger partner,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/izpb/10109/sozialliberale-koalition-und-innere-reformen?p=3|title=Sozialliberale Koalition und innere Reformen|author=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung|access-date=10 November 2015}}</ref> That same year, A reform of naming for partners after marriage was carried out,<ref name="walker1" /> together with a reform of marriage law, which eliminated "moral guilt" as a criterion for alimony payment obligations.<ref name="walker1" /> The First Marriage Reform Law of 1976 stated that pension entitlements acquired during marriage must be shared with the economically weaker spouse following divorce.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> In 1977, a law was introduced which enabled married women to enter employment without the permission of their husbands,<ref>http://www.genet.ac.uk/workpapers/GeNet2007p28.pdf {{Bare URL inline|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref> while prison reforms guaranteed inmates access to courts for any violations of their rights,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4af2Ko82tZIC&pg=PA320 |title=Essentials of Corrections|access-date=10 November 2015}}</ref> limited sentences in all but the gravest cases to 15 years, and proclaimed rehabilitation to be the objective of incarceration.<ref>''German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation'' by William W.

=== Implications for a socialist Europe ===
An amendment to the legal code for residency permits was made in 1978, which granted foreign residents the right to unlimited residence permits after five years of continuous residency. The amendment also stated that legal residents would be eligible for a residence entitlement after eight years if certain conditions were met, such as language fluency.<ref name="autogenerated5">''Immigration Policy in the Federal Republic of Germany: Negotiating Membership and Remaking the Nation'' by Douglas B.

On 16 May 2014, Schmidt said the situation in [[Ukraine]] was dangerous, because "Europe, the Americans and also Russia are behaving in a way that [[Christopher Clark]], described in his book ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' that's very much worth reading, as the beginning of World War I: like sleepwalkers."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-16/ukraine-crisis-resembles-europe-1914-says-helmut-schmidt.html |title=Ukraine Crisis Echoes 1914, German Ex-Leader Schmidt Says |work=Bloomberg |date=16 May 2014 }}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Schmidt admired the philosopher [[Karl Popper]], and contributed a foreword to the 1982 ''[[Festschrift]]'' in Popper's honor.<ref>Helmut Schmidt, "The Way of Freedom", in ''In Pursuit of Truth: Essays on the Philosophy of Karl Popper, On the Occasion of his 80th Birthday'', ed. [[Paul Levinson]], Humanities Press, 1982, pp. xi–xii.</ref>

Schmidt was a talented pianist, and recorded piano concertos of both [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] with German pianist and conductor [[Christoph Eschenbach]]. Schmidt recorded Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 7 (Mozart)|piano concerto for three pianos]], K. 242, with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] directed by Eschenbach in 1982 with pianists Eschenbach and [[Justus Frantz]] for EMI Records (CDC 7 47473 2). In that recording, according to the CD's [[liner notes]], Schmidt played the part written for Countess Antonia Lodron's youngest daughter Giuseppina, "almost a beginner" who commissioned the work. The part brilliantly "enables any reasonably practiced amateur to participate in a performance". The same musical notes also indicate that Schmidt and Frantz had played duets during Frantz's student days. In 1990 Schmidt joined Eschenbach, Frantz, [[Gerhard Oppitz]] and the [[Philharmoniker Hamburg|Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra]] in [[Deutsche Grammophon]]'s recording of Bach's [[Keyboard concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach#Concerto in A minor for four harpsichords.2C BWV 1065|Concerto in A minor for four harpsichords]], BWV 1065.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=[[Badische Zeitung]] | date = 10 December 2008 | author = Alexander Dick | title = Der Klavier-Kanzler | url = http://www.badische-zeitung.de/panorama/der-klavier-kanzler--8963225.html | language=de}}</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F048646-0033, Dortmund, SPD-Parteitag, Helmut Schmidt.jpg|thumb|Schmidt smoking]]
All his adult life, Schmidt was a heavy smoker. He was well known for lighting up during TV interviews and talk shows. On 13 October 1981, Schmidt was fitted with a [[artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dann rumpelt es in der Brust ...|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14338700.html|access-date=10 November 2015|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|issue=43/1981|date=19 October 1981|language=de}}</ref>

On 25 January 2008, German police launched an inquiry after an anti-smoking initiative charged that Schmidt was defying the recently introduced [[smoking ban]]. The initiative claimed that Schmidt had been flagrantly ignoring anti-smoking laws. Despite pictures in the press, the case was subsequently dropped after the public prosecutor's office ruled that Schmidt's actions had not been a threat to public health.<ref>''[[Der Spiegel]]'': [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/0,1518,530882,00.html "Strafanzeige: Altkanzler Schmidt raucht trotz Verbots – Staatsanwalt ermittelt"] (han) 25 January 2008; [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/nichtraucher-debatte-altkanzler-schmidt-liess-die-zigaretten-stecken-a-531306.html "Nichtraucher-Debatte: Altkanzler Schmidt ließ die Zigaretten stecken"] (flo/dpa) 27 January 2008; [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/ich-bin-doch-nicht-verrueckt-helmut-schmidt-bleibt-raucher-a-535051.html "'Ich bin doch nicht verrückt': Helmut Schmidt bleibt Raucher"] (pad/AP), 13 February 2008 {{in lang|de}}</ref>

A state funeral for Schmidt was held on 23 November at the Protestant (Lutheran) [[St. Michael's Church, Hamburg]], where Loki Schmidt's funeral had been held. German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], in remarks to mourners, said, "He will be missed. He was an astute observer and commentator, and it was with good reason that he had a reputation for dependability." Others who spoke included former U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]]. Speaking in German, he lauded Schmidt for "vision and courage", based on the principles of "reason, law, peace and faith", and said Schmidt had been "a kind of world conscience".

Among the 1,800 who attended were German President [[Joachim Gauck]], former U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] and former French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], whose tenure in office paralleled Schmidt's as German chancellor.

== Controversies over service in World War II ==
In 2017, after Minister of Defense [[Ursula von der Leyen]] issued an order to remove ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' memorabilia from barracks and other institutions of the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', a photo of the young Lieutenant Helmut Schmidt in ''Wehrmacht'' uniform was removed from the military's Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg. Although the photo is now displayed again, the initial decision has caused a debate over Schmidt's service in the ''Wehrmacht''. According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', von der Leyen initially distanced herself from this decision, yet after a few days, she explained that Schmidt, as Minister of Defense and later Chancellor, was important in the formation of the ''Bundeswehr'' as a democratic army, but his time in the ''Wehrmacht'' had nothing to do with this.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wiegrefe |first1=Klaus |title=Ex-Kanzler in Wehrmachtsuniform. Helmut Schmidt darf wieder an die Wand |url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/helmut-schmidt-in-wehrmachtsuniform-darf-wieder-an-die-wand-a-1152162.html |access-date=20 May 2019 |agency=Spiegel online |date=14 June 2017|language=de}}</ref> Historian [[Michael Wolffsohn]] argues that Schmidt avoided explaining about what he had done between 1940 and 1945." He further comments that the whole Schmidt affair reveals that while the ''Bundeswehr'' is not "a state within state", there is an uncritical milieu in the ''Bundeswehr'' that does not correspond to the spirit of the majority in the German society and might get larger if unchecked. He recommends that the photo be displayed again, but with explanations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wolffsohn |first1=Michael |title=Das Helmut-Schmidt-Foto und die Pinnwand-Lüge |url=https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/politik-inland/wolffsohn-bundeswehr-51768718.bild.html |access-date=20 May 2019 |agency=The Local |date=16 May 2017|language=de}}</ref> [[Theo Sommer]], a prominent journalist and former Chief of Planning Staff for the Ministry of Defence, while agreeing that the military leadership should pay attention to extremism within the ''Bundeswehr'', criticizes von der Leyen for her overreaction and Wolffsohn for false representation of Schmidt's attitude. According to Sommer, Schmidt had always been frank about his service on the Eastern Front: while he denied that he had ever seen or known about mass extermination of Jews in Russia, Schmidt admitted he often had to shoot at villages and then recognized the smell of burnt flesh. Schmidt said the troops were never taught about the [[Geneva Conventions]], and by standards of today, he would have to go to court "a dozen times".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sommer |first1=Theo |title=Seite 2/2: Helmut Schmidts Rolle im zweiten Weltkrieg ist gar nicht so ungeklärt.
