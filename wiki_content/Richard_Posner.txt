Posner is known for his scholarly range and for writing on topics outside of his primary field, law. In his various writings and books, he has addressed [[Animal welfare in the United States|animal rights]], [[Feminism in the United States|feminism]], [[Federal drug policy of the United States|drug prohibition]], [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], [[Keynesian economics]], and academic moral philosophy, among other subjects.

Posner is the author of nearly 40 books on jurisprudence, economics, and several other topics, including ''Economic Analysis of Law'', ''The Economics of Justice'', ''The Problems of Jurisprudence'', ''[[Sex and Reason]]'', ''Law, Pragmatism and Democracy'', and ''The Crisis of Capitalist Democracy''. Posner has generally been identified as being politically conservative; however, in recent years he has distanced himself from the positions of the Republican party,<ref>{{cite news|first=James |last=Warren |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/14/richard-posner-bashes-supreme-court-s-citizens-united-ruling.html |title=Richard Posner Bashes Supreme Court's Citizens United Ruling |website=The Daily Beast |date=July 14, 2012 |access-date=2014-08-25}}</ref> authoring more [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] rulings involving same-sex marriage and [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Farias|first1=Christian|title=Judge Appointed by Ronald Reagan Strikes Down Wisconsin Abortion Law|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-wisconsin-abortion-law_5654a4ece4b0879a5b0c98df|access-date=26 November 2015|work=Huffington Post}}</ref><ref name="South Bend Voice">{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Kyle|title=Appeals Court Rules Indiana and Wisconsin Gay Marriage Bans Unconstitutional|url=http://southbendvoice.com/2014/09/04/appeals-court-rules-indiana-and-wisconsin-gay-marriage-bans-unconstitutional/|access-date=4 September 2014|work=South Bend Voice}}</ref> In ''[[A Failure of Capitalism]]'', he has written that the 2008 financial crisis has caused him to question the [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice]], ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic model that lies at the heart of his law and economics theory.

==Early life and education==
Richard Posner was born on January 11, 1939, in [[New York City]].  His father's family were of [[Romanian Jewish]] descent, and his mother's family were [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from Galicia in the Austrian Empire.<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MJYY-638 FamilySearch.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.igreens.org.uk/richard_posner.htm ''The Bench Burner: An interview with Richard Posner''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509143331/http://www.igreens.org.uk/richard_posner.htm |date=May 9, 2007 }}, Reprint of article from ''New Yorker'' by [[Larissa MacFarquhar]], Dec. 10, 2001: "Posner grew up in New York - first in Manhattan and then in Scarsdale. His mother's relatives were Jews from Vienna who looked down on his father's family, which was from Romania and poorer than they were. 'They were all poor,' Posner says, 'but my mothers family had toilet paper, and my father's family had newspaper.' " As shown on original sources freely available at FamilySearch.org, Posner's mother's family was actually from Husiatyn in the Austrian Empire (not Vienna), which is now in Ukraine.</ref> After finishing high school, Posner attended [[Yale University]], graduating in 1959 with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in [[English literature]] and being elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in his junior year.  He then attended [[Harvard Law School]], where he was president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' and graduated in 1962 ranked first in his class with an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] ''[[Latin honors#United States|magna cum laude]]''.<ref name="cnn1">{{cite news

After law school, Posner [[law clerk|clerked]] for Justice [[William J. Brennan Jr.]] of the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] from 1962 to 1963. He then served as an attorney-advisor to Commissioner [[Philip Elman]] of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC); he would later argue that the FTC ought to be abolished.<ref name="cnn1" /> Posner went on to work in the Office of the Solicitor General in the [[United States Department of Justice]], under [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[Thurgood Marshall]].<ref name="cnn1" />

In 1968, Posner accepted a position teaching at [[Stanford Law School]].<ref name="cnn1"/> In 1969, Posner moved to the faculty of the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he remains a senior lecturer. He was a founding editor of ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'' in 1972.

On October 27, 1981, Posner was nominated by President [[Ronald Reagan]] to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] vacated by Judge [[Philip Willis Tone]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news

Posner is a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] in [[philosophy]] and an [[economist]] in [[international legal theory|legal methodology]]. He has written many articles and books on a wide range of topics including law and economics, law and literature, the federal judiciary, [[moral theory]], [[intellectual property]], [[antitrust law]], public intellectuals, and [[legal history]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/books/review/richard-posner-biography-william-domnarski.html|title=The Provocative Life of Judge Richard Posner|last=Witt|first=John Fabian|date=2016-10-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He is also well known for writing on a wide variety of current events including the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] recount controversy, [[Bill Clinton]]'s affair with [[Monica Lewinsky]]<ref name="nytimes" /> and his resulting impeachment procedure,<ref>See {{smallcaps|Richard A.

His analysis of the [[Lewinsky scandal]] cut across most party and ideological divisions. Posner's greatest influence is through his writings on law and economics; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him "one of the most important [[antitrust]] scholars of the past half-century." In December 2004, Posner started a joint [[blog]] with [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Gary Becker]], titled simply "The Becker-Posner Blog".<ref name="posner becker">{{cite news

Posner was mentioned in 2005 as a [[George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates|potential nominee]] to replace [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] because of his prominence as a scholar and an appellate judge. Robert S. Boynton wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that he believed Posner would never sit on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] because despite his "obvious brilliance," he would be criticized for his occasionally "outrageous conclusions," such as his contention "that the [[rule of law]] is an accidental and dispensable element of legal ideology," his argument that buying and selling children on the [[free market]] would lead to better outcomes than the present situation, government-regulated [[adoption]], and his support for the legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[LSD]].<ref name=Boynton>Boynton, Robert S.

Judge Posner was the focus of a "series" of posts (many Q&A interviews with the Judge) done by University of Washington Law Professor [[Ronald K. L. Collins]]. The twelve posts—collectively titled "Posner on Posner"—began on November 24, 2014, and ended on January 5, 2015, and appeared on the Concurring Opinions blog.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Collins | first = Ronald K.

==Legal and philosophical positions==
[[File:Posneratftc.jpg|thumb|275px|Judge Posner making a dinner speech at the [[Federal Trade Commission]].]]

In Posner's youth and in the 1960s as law clerk to William J. Brennan, he was generally counted as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. However, in reaction to some of the perceived excesses of the late 1960s, Posner developed a strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] bent. He encountered [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] economists [[Aaron Director]] and [[George Stigler]] while a professor at [[Stanford]].<ref name="cnn1" /> Posner summarized his views on law and economics in his 1973 book ''The Economic Analysis of Law''.<ref name="cnn1" />

Today, although generally viewed as to [[Right-wing politics|the right]] in academia, Posner's [[pragmatism]], his qualified [[moral relativism]] and [[moral skepticism]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Posner |title=The Problematics of Moral and Legal Theory |volume=111 |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |issue=7 |pages=1637, 1642–46 |year=1998 |jstor=1342477 |doi=10.2307/1342477 |url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/journal_articles/7091 }} (clarifying his moral positions)</ref> and his affection for the thought of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] set him apart from most American conservatives.  As a judge, with the exception of his rulings with respect to the sentencing guidelines and the recording of police actions, Posner's judicial votes have always placed him on the moderate-to-liberal wing of the Republican Party, where he has become more isolated over time. In July 2012, Posner stated, "I've become less conservative since the Republican Party started becoming goofy."<ref>Nina Totenberg, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/07/05/156319272/federal-judge-richard-posner-the-gop-has-made-me-less-conservative Federal Judge Richard Posner: The GOP Has Made Me Less Conservative] [[NPR]], July 5, 2012</ref> Among Posner's judicial influences are the American jurists [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] and [[Learned Hand]].

In June 2016, Posner was criticized by right-wing media organizations for a column he wrote for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in which he stated, "I see absolutely no value to a judge of spending decades, years, months, weeks, day, hours, minutes, or seconds studying the Constitution, the history of its enactment, its amendments, and its implementation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2016/supreme_court_breakfast_table_for_june_2016/law_school_professors_need_more_practical_experience.html?wpsrc=sh_all_mob_tw_top|title=Supreme Court Breakfast Table|first=Richard A.|last=Posner|date=June 24, 2016|work=Slate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/federal-judge-u-s-constitution-is-outdated-judges-should-stop-studying-it/|title=Federal Judge: U.S. Constitution Is Outdated, Judges Should Stop Studying It|website=www.mediaite.com}}</ref>

He has called his approach to judging pragmatic. "I pay very little attention to legal rules, statutes, constitutional provisions. ... A case is just a dispute. The first thing you do is ask yourself—forget about the law—what is a sensible resolution of this dispute? The next thing ... is to see if a recent Supreme Court precedent or some other legal obstacle stood in the way of ruling in favor of that sensible resolution. And the answer is that's actually rarely the case. When you have a Supreme Court case or something similar, they're often extremely easy to get around."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/us/politics/judge-richard-posner-retirement.html?module=WatchingPortal&region=c-column-middle-span-region&pgType=Homepage&action=click&mediaId=thumb_square&state=standard&contentPlacement=2&version=internal&contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F09%2F11%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fjudge-richard-posner-retirement.html&eventName=Watching-article-click Posner retirement]</ref>

===Abortion===
Posner has written several opinions sympathetic to [[abortion rights]], including a decision that held that late term abortion was constitutionally protected in some circumstances.<ref>[[Alissa J. Rubin|Rubin, Alissa]] (1999-02-11) [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/11/news/mn-7143 Anti-Abortion Advocates Gain Ground in Late-Term Debate], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>

In November 2015, Posner authored a decision in ''Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Schimel'' striking down regulations on abortion clinics in Wisconsin.  He rejected the state's argument that the laws were written to protect the health of women and not to make abortion more difficult to obtain.  Accusing the state of indirectly trying to ban abortions in the state Posner wrote, "They [Wisconsin] may do this in the name of protecting the health of women who have abortions, yet as in this case the specific measures they support may do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion."<ref>{{cite web|title=Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Brad Schimel|url=http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2015/D11-23/C:15-1736:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1661222:S:0|access-date=15 December 2015}}</ref>

===Animal rights===
Posner rejects an ethic of strong animal rights on pragmatic grounds (where such an ethic posits the moral irrelevance of species membership).<ref>"But I do not agree that we have a duty to (the other) animals that arises from their being the equal members of a community composed of all those creatures in the universe that can feel pain, and that it is merely "prejudice" in a disreputable sense akin to racial prejudice or sexism that makes us "discriminate" in favor of our own species. You assume the existence of the universe-wide community of pain and demand reasons why the boundary of our concern should be drawn any more narrowly. I start from the bottom up, with the brute fact that we, like other animals, prefer our own—our own family, the "pack" that we happen to run with (being a social animal), and the larger sodalities constructed on the model of the smaller ones, of which the largest for most of us is our nation. Americans have distinctly less feeling for the pains and pleasures of foreigners than of other Americans and even less for most of the nonhuman animals that we share the world with.

Now you may reply that these are just facts about human nature; that they have no normative significance. But they do. Suppose a dog menaced a human infant and the only way to prevent the dog from biting the infant was to inflict severe pain on the dog—more pain, in fact, than the bite would inflict on the infant. You would have to say, let the dog bite (for "if an animal feels pain, the pain matters as much as it does when a human feels pain," provided the pain is as great). But any normal person (and not merely the infant's parents!), including a philosopher when he is not self-consciously engaged in philosophizing, would say that it would be monstrous to spare the dog, even though to do so would minimize the sum of pain in the world.

I do not feel obliged to defend this reaction; it is a moral intuition deeper than any reason that could be given for it and impervious to any reason that you or anyone could give against it. Membership in the human species is not a "morally irrelevant fact," as the race and sex of human beings has come to seem. If the moral irrelevance of humanity is what philosophy teaches, and so we have to choose between philosophy and the intuition that says that membership in the human species is morally relevant, then it is philosophy that will have to go."

Retrieved May 7, 2021.</ref> He recognizes the philosophical force of arguments for strong animal rights, but maintains that human intuition about the paramount value of human life makes it impossible to accommodate an ethic of strong animal rights. Posner, a self-avowed moral anti-realist,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Posner|first=Richard|title=The Problematics of Moral and Legal Theory|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2828&context=journal_articles|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=1998|volume=111|issue=7|pages=1637–1717|doi=10.2307/1342477|jstor=1342477}}</ref> does not present his critique of strong animal rights as a deductive proof. Instead, he highlights the practical importance of intuition and emotion over abstract argument. In response to the philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in 2001 at [[Slate magazine]], Posner concludes by saying "in our debate, Professor Singer, it is you who are the tough guy, and I the softie, the sentimentalist, willing to base animal rights on empathy, unwilling to follow the utilitarian logic to the harsh conclusions sketched above."<ref name="Slate">{{Cite web|title=Animal Rights Debate: Peter Singer vs Richard Posner|url=https://famous-trials.com/animalrights/2601-animal-rights-debate-peter-singer-vs-richard-posner|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-07|website=Originally Published on [[Slate magazine]].}}</ref>

In a 2000 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' book review on the title "Rattling the Cage" by [[Steven M. Wise]], Posner again criticized the legal notion of animal rights. In the review, Posner argues that Wise's approach, using the cognitive ability of animals compared to that of very young normal human beings as a basis for rights-worthiness, is arbitrary and in contrast with major traditional and contemporary philosophies (including the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]] for one and [[utilitarianism]] for another). In addition, he points out that this basis for rights has problematic implications&mdash;including that it might soon make some computers more worthy of rights than some humans, a conclusion he calls absurd. Posner goes on to reason that granting human-like rights to animals is fraught with implications which could radically disrupt or devalue the rights of human beings. He alludes to Hitler's zoophilia as evidence that respect for animals and humaneness toward human beings are not necessarily associated. Arguing that the analogy of animal rights to the civil rights movement lacks imagination and is not very apt, Posner posits that animal welfare might be better protected by other legal models, one example of which would be stronger laws making animals property, since, he asserts, people tend to protect what they own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/378_vgs9bdkn.pdf|title=Animal Rights}}</ref>

Posner engaged in a debate with the philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in 2001 at ''[[Slate magazine]].'' He agrees that "gratuitous cruelty to and neglect of animals is wrong and that some costs should be incurred to reduce the suffering of animals raised for food or other human purposes or subjected to medical or other testing and experimentation," but rejects grounding this view in an ethic of strong animal rights, contending that such a premise entails conclusions inconsistent with the reality of human society and psychology. He further states that people whose opinions were changed by consideration of the philosophical arguments presented in Singer's book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' failed to see the "radicalism of the ethical vision that powers [their] view on animals, an ethical vision that finds greater value in a healthy pig than in a profoundly retarded child, that commands inflicting a lesser pain on a human being to avert a greater pain to a dog, and that, provided only that a chimpanzee has 1 percent of the mental ability of a normal human being, would require the sacrifice of the human being to save 101 chimpanzees."<ref name="Slate" />

Posner emphasizes the importance of facts over arguments in creating social change. He states that his moral intuition says that "it is wrong to give as much weight to a dog's pain as to an infant's pain," and that "[this] is a moral intuition deeper than any reason that could be given for it and impervious to any reason that you or anyone could give against it." Instead, Posner claims that "[expanding and invigorating] the laws that protect animals will require not philosophical arguments for reducing human beings to the level of the other animals but facts, facts that will stimulate a greater empathetic response to animal suffering and facts that will alleviate concern about the human costs of further measures to reduce animal suffering."<ref name=Slate/>

===Antitrust===
Along with [[Robert Bork]], Posner helped shape the antitrust policy changes of the 1970s through his idea that 1960s antitrust laws were in fact making prices higher for the consumer rather than lower, while he viewed lower prices as the essential end goal of any antitrust policy.<ref name="cnn1"/> Posner's and Bork's theories on antitrust evolved into the prevailing view in academia and at the Justice Department in the George H. W. Bush Administration; they have remained the consensus view in both the Justice Department and among legal academics of antitrust.<ref name="cnn1"/>

Posner is "one of the founding fathers of ''Bluebook'' abolitionism, having advocated it for almost twenty-five years, ever since his 1986 ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' article<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1599750|title=Goodbye to the Bluebook|first=Richard A.|last=Posner|date=July 29, 1986|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1343–1368|doi=10.2307/1599750}}</ref> on the subject."<ref name=VC>Somin, Ilya (2011-01-25) [http://volokh.com/2011/01/25/richard-posner-on-the-bluebook/ Richard Posner on the Bluebook], ''[[Volokh Conspiracy]]''</ref> In a 2011 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article, he wrote:

<blockquote>''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation'' exemplifies hypertrophy in the anthropological sense. It is a monstrous growth, remote from the functional need for legal citation forms, that serves obscure needs of the legal culture and its student subculture.<ref>[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/review/the-bluebook-blues The ''Bluebook'' Blues, 120 Yale L.J. 850 (2011)]</ref></blockquote>

He describes those needs as unrelated to practical legal activity but instead as social and political.

In the same article, Posner gives an excerpt of the entire citation style guide included (as an appendix) in the short manual he gives his own legal clerks (whom he describes as "very smart"); the appendix is about 2–3 pages long, and he says the entire manual is about 1% as long as the Bluebook.

===Drugs===
Posner opposes the U.S. "[[War on Drugs]]" and called it "[[quixotism|quixotic]]". In a 2003 [[CNBC]] interview he discussed the difficulty of enforcing criminal [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] laws, and asserted that it is hard to justify the criminalization of marijuana when compared to other substances.  In a talk at [[Elmhurst College]] in 2012, Posner said that "I don't think that we should have a fraction of the drug laws that we have.  I think it's really absurd to be criminalizing possession or use or distribution of marijuana."<ref>{{YouTube|id=AhBBV0aI7lM#t=3247s}}</ref>

=== Legal rules ===
In an interview with [[Adam Liptak]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' after announcing his retirement, Posner says he pays "very little attention to legal rules":

{{quote|I pay very little attention to legal rules, statutes, constitutional provisions," Judge Posner said. "A case is just a dispute. The first thing you do is ask yourself—forget about the law—what is a sensible resolution of this dispute?

The next thing, he said, was to see if a recent Supreme Court precedent or some other legal obstacle stood in the way of ruling in favor of that sensible resolution. "And the answer is that's actually rarely the case," he said. "When you have a Supreme Court case or something similar, they're often extremely easy to get around.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Liptak |first1=Adam |title=An Exit Interview With Richard Posner, Judicial Provocateur |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/us/politics/judge-richard-posner-retirement.html |access-date=17 June 2020 |date=11 September 2017}}</ref>}}

=== National security ===
At the ''Cybercrime 2020: The Future of Online Crime and Investigations'' conference held at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] on November 20, 2014, Posner, in addition to further reinforcing his views on privacy being over-rated, stated that "If the NSA wants to vacuum all the trillions of bits of information that are crawling through the electronic worldwide networks, I think that's fine. ... Much of what passes for the name of privacy is really just trying to conceal the disreputable parts of your conduct," Posner added. "Privacy is mainly about trying to improve your social and business opportunities by concealing the sorts of bad activities that would cause other people not to want to deal with you." Posner also criticized [[mobile OS]] companies for enabling [[end-to-end encryption]] in their newest software. "I'm shocked at the thought that a company would be permitted to manufacture an electronic product that the government would not be able to search" he said.<ref>{{citation|title=Judge: Give NSA unlimited access to digital data |date=December 4, 2014|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2855776/judge-give-nsa-unlimited-access-to-digital-data.html}}</ref>

===Newspapers===
Posner supported the creation of a law barring [[hyperlinks]] or [[paraphrasing of copyrighted material]] as a means to prevent what he views as [[Free-rider problem|free riding]] on newspaper journalism.<ref>{{cite web

===Patent and copyright law===
Posner has expressed concerns, on the blog he contributed to with Gary Becker,  that both patent and copyright protection, though particularly the former, may be excessive. He argues that the cost of inventing must be compared to the cost of copying in order to determine the optimal patent protection for an inventor. When patent protection is too strongly in favor of the inventor, market efficiency is decreased. He illustrates his argument by comparing the pharmaceutical industry (where the cost on invention is high) with the software industry (where the cost of invention is relatively low).<ref>{{cite web

===Police recording===
As part of a three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit in Chicago, weighing a challenge to the Illinois Eavesdropping Act, which bars the secret recording of conversations without the consent of all the parties to the conversation, Posner was to deliver another memorable quote. At issue was the constitutionality of the Illinois wiretapping law, which makes it illegal to record someone without consent even when filming public acts like arrests in public. Posner interrupted the [[ACLU]] after just 14 words, stating, "Yeah, I know. But I'm not interested, really, in what you want to do with these recordings of peoples' encounters with the police. ..." Posner continued: "Once all this stuff can be recorded, there's going to be a lot more of this snooping around by reporters and bloggers. ... I'm always suspicious when the civil liberties people start telling the police how to do their business."<ref>{{cite web

 |url=http://suffolkmedialaw.com/2011/09/27/tell-us-judge-posner-who-watches-the-watchmen/}}</ref> The 7th Circuit upheld the challenge, 2–1, striking down the Eavesdropping Act, but Posner wrote a dissenting opinion.

===Prisoners===
In a dissent from an earlier ruling by his protégé [[Frank Easterbrook]], Posner wrote that Easterbrook's decision that female guards could watch male prisoners while in the shower or bathroom must stem from a belief that prisoners are "members of a different species, indeed as a type of [[vermin]], devoid of [[human dignity]] and entitled to no respect. ... I do not myself consider the 1.5 million inmates of American prisons and jails in that light."<ref name="cnn1"/><ref>''Johnson v. Phelan'', 69 F.3d 144, 151 (7th Cir. 1995) (Posner, J., dissenting).</ref>

===Race and public education===
Posner's views of public education policy are informed by his view that groups of students differ in intellectual ability, and therefore, that it is faulty to impose uniform educational standards on all schools. His view in this regard is undergirded by his view that different races differ in intelligence. (However, Posner says that he thinks it is "highly unlikely" that these differences are rooted in genetics, rather than environment.)

In a blog post, Posner wrote, "I suggest that the only worthwhile reforms of teacher compensation are raising teacher wages uniformly, providing recognition and modest bonuses for outstanding teachers, and increasing hiring standards."<ref>{{citation|title=Rating Teachers - Posner|url=http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2012/09/rating-teachersposner.html}}</ref>
In the same post, he wrote, "I am not clear what we should think the problem of American education (below the college level) is. Most children of middle-class ... Americans are white or Asian and attend good public or private schools, usually predominantly white. The average white IQ is of course 100 and the Asian (like the Jewish) almost one standard deviation higher, that is, 115. The average black IQ is 85, a full standard deviation below the white average, and the average Hispanic IQ has been estimated recently at 89. Black children in particular often come from disordered households, which has a negative effect on ability to learn and perhaps indeed on IQ. ... Increasingly, black and Hispanic students find themselves in schools with few white or Asian students. The challenge to American education is to provide a useful education to the large number of Americans who are unlikely to benefit from a college education or from high school courses aimed at preparing students for college."

===Same-sex marriage===
In September 2014, Posner authored the opinions in the consolidated cases of ''[[Wolf v. Walker]]'' and ''[[Baskin v. Bogan]]'' challenging Wisconsin and Indiana's state level same-sex marriage bans.  The opinion of the three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that [[Indiana]] and [[Wisconsin]]'s bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional, affirming a lower court ruling.<ref name="South Bend Voice"/> During oral arguments, Wisconsin's attorney general cited tradition as a reason for maintaining the ban, prompting Posner to note that: "It was tradition to not allow blacks and whites to marry – a tradition that got swept away." Though Posner argued in his 1992 book ''[[Sex and Reason]]'' that prohibitions against gay marriage were rationally justified, he held in the 2014 cases that the [[same-sex marriage]] bans were both "a tradition of hate" and "savage discrimination".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Kyle|title=Appeals Court Judge Calls Indiana's Same-Sex Marriage Ban 'Tradition of Hate'|url=http://southbendvoice.com/2014/08/26/appeals-court-judge-calls-indianas-same-sex-marriage-ban-tradition-of-hate/|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=South Bend Voice}}</ref>  Posner wrote the opinion for the unanimous panel, finding the laws unconstitutional under the [[Equal Protection Clause]].  The Supreme Court then denied writ of certiorari and left Posner's ruling to stand.

===Torture===
When reviewing [[Alan Dershowitz]]'s book, ''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge'', Posner wrote in the September 2002 ''[[The New Republic]]'', "If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary [[ticking time bomb scenario|to prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb]] in [[Times Square]], torture should be used—-and will be used—to obtain the information.... No one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility."<ref>[http://www.tnr.com/article/the-best-offense Posener, September 2, 2002, "The Best Offense", ''The New Republic'' (reviewing ''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge'' by Alan M.

==Judicial career==
Posner is one of the most prolific legal writers, through both the number and topical breadth of his opinions, to say nothing of his scholarly and popular writings.<ref name="wsj2">{{cite news

In 1999, Posner was welcomed as a private [[mediation|mediator]] among the parties involved in the [[United States v. Microsoft|Microsoft antitrust case]].<ref name="nytimes"/>

A study published by Fred Shapiro in the University of Chicago's ''The Journal of Legal Studies'' found Posner is the most-cited legal scholar of all time by a considerable margin, as Posner's work has generated 7,981 cites compared to the runner-up [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s 4,488 cites.<ref name=ShapiroJLS/> Aside from the sheer volume of his output, Posner's opinions enjoy great respect from other judges, based on citations, and within the legal academy, where his opinions are taught in many foundational law courses.

===Notable cases===
In his decision in the 1997 case ''[[State Oil Co. v. Khan]]'', Posner wrote that a ruling 1968 antitrust precedent set by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] was "moth-eaten", "wobbly", and "unsound".<ref name="cnn1"/> Nevertheless, he abided by the previous decision with his ruling.<ref name="cnn1"/> The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] and overturned the 1968 ruling unanimously; [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] wrote the opinion and spoke positively of both Posner's criticism and his decision to abide by the ruling until the Court decided to change it.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news

====Tort law====
In ''[[Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v.

In 1999, Posner applied the ''[[lex loci delicti commissi]]'' rule on [[choice of law]] rather than the [[Restatement of Torts, Second]] when rejecting a claim by an Illinois dentist who [[slip and fall|slipped and fell]] in [[Acapulco]], Mexico.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Jack L.|last2=Sykes|first2=Alan O.|title=''Lex Loci Delictus'' and Global Economic Welfare: ''Spinozzi v.

====Contract law====
In ''Morin Building Products Co. v. Baystone Construction, Inc.'' (1983), Posner held that the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] presumes contracts impose an objective standard upon what would subjectively be [[illusory promise]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brewer|first1=Scott|title=Satisfaction and Posner's ''Morin'' Opinion: ''Aliquando Bonus Dormitat Posnerus''?|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|date=2007|volume=120|page=1123|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/brewer.pdf|access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref>  In 1987, Posner dissented when Judges [[Frank H.

====Civil rights====
In 1984, Posner wrote for the ''[[en banc]]'' circuit when it held that a [[consent decree]] regulating law enforcement [[Red Squad]]s did not apply to FBI terrorism investigations, over the dissent of Judge [[Richard Dickson Cudahy]]. In January 2001, Posner loosened that consent decree to allow the Chicago Police Department to conduct counterterrorism operations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vermeule|first1=Adrian|author-link1=Adrian Vermeule|title=Posner on Security and Liberty: ''Alliance to End Repression v.
