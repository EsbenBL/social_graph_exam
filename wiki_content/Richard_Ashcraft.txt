[[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] claimed in 1986 that Ashcraft "has been one of the most effective and interesting analysts of [[John Locke|Locke]]'s social and political thought for nearly two decades" and that his ''Revolutionary Politics and Locke's Two Treatises of Government'' was "not only by far the most impressive political biography of Locke available but also the fullest study to date of "radical" politics in England between the late 1660s and 1689".<ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Dunn |title=Review: Revolutionary Politics and Locke's ‘Two Treatises of Government’ by Richard Ashcraft |journal=[[Journal of Modern History]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |year=1988 |pages=366–68 |jstor=1881148 }}</ref>
