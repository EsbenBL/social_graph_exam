==Research==
Modood's research interests include racism, [[racial equality]], [[multiculturalism]] and [[secularism]]. Modood was the principal researcher involved in the Fourth National Survey of Ethnic Minorities in Britain published as ''Ethnic Minorities in Britain: Diversity and Disadvantage'' by the [[Policy Studies Institute]] at the [[University of Westminster]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hej.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/57/3/282|title=Ethnic Minorities in Britain: Diversity and Disadvantage|work=Health Education Journal, Vol. 57, No. 3, 282–283 (1998)|publisher=Policy Studies Institute|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref> Research that he led in 1999 showed that university lecturers from ethnic minorities were half as likely to become professors compared to white lecturers. The research concluded "''minority ethnic groups experienced discrimination in applications for posts and promotions, harassment and negative stereotyping''".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jun/18/race.world|title=Unequal job prospects for black academics|last=Carvel|first=John|date=18 June 1999|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref> A study published in 2002 found that older universities in the UK discriminated against Indians, Pakistanis, black Africans and Irish students whereas some universities formed since 1992 actively favoured ethnic minorities. Modood said he thought that the discrimination was not conscious and that "''Universities generally pride themselves on their ethnic diversity and would have no truck with deliberate discrimination''".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/23/highereducation.race|title='Racial bias' at UK's elite universities|last=McVeigh|first=Tracy|date=23 June 2002|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=17 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref> In 2004 he co-authored a report for the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] which found that ethnic minority graduates were less likely to gain top jobs than their white counterparts. The difference was thought to be partly due to discrimination but also due to the fact that ethnic minority students do not achieve as high grades at university.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/the-spice-of-working-life-546408.html|title= The spice of working life|last=Hilpern|first=Kate|date=16 September 2004|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=17 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref> In 2006 he co-authored a report that examined whether policies used to increase employment levels among ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada and the United States could be applied to Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2006/5218.html|title=International approaches to ethnic minority employment|date=15 December 2006|publisher=Bristol University|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref> He was Bristol director of the Leverhulme Programme on Migration and Citizenship with [[University College London|UCL]]. He has served on the DfES Race, Education and Employment Forum, was part of the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain (1997–2000), and a member of the IPPR Commission on National Security (2007–09) and a member of the National Equality Panel chaired by Professor John Hills (2008–10). He is also a co-founder of the [[scientific journal]] ''[[Ethnicities (journal)|Ethnicities]]''.<ref name=geo/>

Tariq Modood currently serves as part of a steering group for the Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life.

==Opinions==
Modood defines [[Egalitarianism|equality]] as: "''not having to hide or apologise for one's origins, family or community but requiring others to show respect for them, and adapt public attitudes and arrangements so that the heritage they represent is encouraged rather than contemptuously expect them to wither away.''"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/law-and-the-wives-of-others/story-0-1111116757239|title=Law and the wives of others |last=Malik|first=Kenan|date=28 June 2008|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>

Modood is critical of policies that force secular identities upon religious minorities, he has coined the term "radical secularism" for this and commented that it "''cannot be secured without illiberal measures''".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/EuropeanMuslims/Politics/2005/12/05.SHTML |title=France & Secularism; A Comparative Review |last=Hussain |first=Dilwar |date=29 January 2006 |publisher=IslamOnline |accessdate=17 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817212800/http://www.islamonline.net/English/EuropeanMuslims/Politics/2005/12/05.SHTML |archivedate=17 August 2007 }}</ref> He has also said that some people feel "''that religious people are not worthy of protection; more than that, they should be subject to not just intellectual criticism but mockery and ridicule...''"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=202014&sectioncode=26|title=Secular, liberal, and doggedly fundamentalist |last=Wajid|first=Sara|date=17 March 2006|publisher=Times Higher Education Supplement|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>

In ''Multicultural Politics: racism, ethnicity and Muslims in Britain'' (2005), Modood argues that multiculturalism should not be abandoned due to criticism following events such as the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]]. He points out that Britain is far less racist than in the past, and that films and television shows such as ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' and ''[[The Kumars at No 42]]'' demonstrate that Britain is multicultural. Despite this, he believes that there are still problems with what he terms "cultural racism" which focuses on language, religion, family structures, dress and cuisine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200508010031|title=The metropolis with seven billion people . Multiculturalism is dead, according to its critics. But the logic of globalisation means an increasing number of people from different cultures living together in future.

Speaking at the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party Conference]] in 2007 he asked "''What is Britishness anyway?''" and said that ethnic minorities should engage with the concept of Britishness which he called a "''very diverse and plural identity''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://21stcenturysocialism.com/article/what_is_britishness_anyway_01540.html|title=What is Britishness, anyway?|date=29 September 2007|publisher=21st Century Socialism|accessdate=17 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120701102055/http://21stcenturysocialism.com/article/what_is_britishness_anyway_01540.html|archivedate=1 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Modood was a signatory of a letter organised by [[Sunny Hundal]] in 2008, that called for [[Gordon Brown]] to abandon plans to [[Counter-Terrorism Bill 2008#42 day terrorist detention without charge|allow terror suspects to be held for up to 42 days without charge]], the plans were later abandoned.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/15/uksecurity.northernireland|title=Home secretary accused of putting off vote on terrorism bill|last=Travis|first=Alan|author2=Nick Watt  |date=15 March 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref>
