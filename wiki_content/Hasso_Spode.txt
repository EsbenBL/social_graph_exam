'''Hasso Spode''' (born 1951 in [[Friedrichshagen]]) is a German [[historian]] and sociologist.

After his childhood in [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]], Hasso Spode flew to [[West Berlin]] where he studied [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[theology]] and [[sociology]]. Today he is professor in Hanover and director of the [[Historical Archive on Tourism]] at the Technical University in Berlin <ref>[https://www.tu-berlin.de/ztg/menue/team/mitarbeiterinnen/spode_hasso_prof_dr/parameter/en/ ''Page at TU Berlin'']</ref> The main focus of his research is on [[Anthropology|historical anthropology]] and [[cultural history]], but he also works in the field of [[Social history|social]] and [[political history]]. He wrote over 200 articles, mostly in German, sometimes in English (translations in Czech, Greek, Romanian, Spanish, French, Danish, Italian, Japanese, Estonian, Russian), and wrote or edited more than a dozen books.<ref>[http://hasso-spode.de/publika/publika.html ''List of publications '']</ref> He is co-editor of [[Annals of Tourism Research]], [[Voyage. Studies on Travel & Tourism]] and other journals, and executive council of the Chinese Center of Drug Policy Studies and the international [[Alcohol and Drugs History Society]]; until 2015 he was vice-president of the Tourism Committee of the [[International Sociological Association]].

In the 1980s Spode analysed the Nazi [[Leisure|leisure time]] organization “[[Strength Through Joy]]” as an important means of social politics in [[Nazi Germany|the Third Reich]]. In 1989 he launched the "study-group for tourism history", the first institution of this kind; in 1991 he published the worldwide first omnibus book in this field of research. Meanwhile, he is a noted expert in the history and theory of [[tourism]]. In this connection, he stresses the romantic character of the tourist consumption and classifies tourist travel as "time travel aback" and, drawing on [[Reinhart Koselleck]] and [[Michel Foucault]], the touristic space as "chronotopia". Further well-known works penned by Spode are on the history and structures of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] use and [[Alcoholism|misuse]],<ref>[http://historyofalcoholanddrugs.typepad.com/alcohol_and_drugs_history/2005/02/spode_reflectio.html ''Autobiographical research essay in SHAD '']</ref> including the phenomenon of [[Substance dependence|addiction]] which he regards as a [[social construction]] reflecting the need for [[Self control|self-control]] in modern societies. According to WorldCat, his book on the "power of drunkenness" alone is held in 186 libraries.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-n88167186 ''Entry in WorldCat '']</ref> Spode also worked on labour disputes, tobacco consumption and other historical and political topics.
