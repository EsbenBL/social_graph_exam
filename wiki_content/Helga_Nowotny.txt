'''Helga Nowotny''' (born 1937<ref>{{cite LAF|id=n83-62721}}</ref>) is Professor emeritus of [[Sociology of science and technology|Social Studies of Science]], [[ETH Zurich]]. She has held numerous leadership roles on Academic boards and public policy councils, and she has authored many publications in the social studies of science and technology.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = NOWOTNY Helga|url = https://erc.europa.eu/organisation/helga-nowotny|website = ERC: European Research Council|access-date = 2015-12-14|publisher = European Research Council}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Nowotny grew up in [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]] during [[World War II]]. In interviews, she has recalled first wanting to become a scientist at the age of 8, when she was sent to [[Vorarlberg]], the westernmost province of Austria, and quickly learned the local dialect.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Interview: Helga Nowotny, ERC President|url = http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2011/06/qanda-Helga-novotny.cfm|website = The Engineering and Technology Magazine|access-date = 2015-12-14|last1 = Burrows|first1 = Erika|last2 = Vitaliev|first2 = Vitali|date = 13 Jun 2011|publisher = The Institution of Engineering and Technology|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222075611/http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2011/06/qanda-Helga-novotny.cfm|archive-date = 22 December 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Nowotny received her [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1959. After completing her degree, she faced opposition to her application for an assistant professorship in the Department of Criminology there on the basis of her being a woman. She agreed with the hiring professor that if a more capable man applied for the position, he could have the job. In the end, she was hired to the position.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Helga Nowotny, President of the ERC: "Europe must regain its confidence through science"|url = http://www.kuleuven.be/english/news/2012/LIF/meet-the-honourees/interviews/helga-nowotny-president-of-the-european-research-council-europe-must-regain-its-confidence-through-science|website = KU Leuven|access-date = 2015-12-14|publisher = KU Leuven}}</ref> It was there that she became interested in the sociology of science. In 1965, she moved to [[New York City]] with her husband, where she enrolled in a sociology doctoral program. There, she met [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Robert K. Merton]], who mentored her throughout her education.<ref name="NowotnyLeroy2009">{{cite journal|last1=Nowotny|first1=Helga|last2=Leroy|first2=Pieter|title=Helga Nowotny: an itinerary between sociology of knowledge and public debate|journal=Natures Sciences Sociétés|volume=17|issue=1|year=2009|pages=57–64|issn=1240-1307|doi=10.1051/nss/2009010|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 1969, Nowotny earned her Ph.D. in [[sociology]] at [[Columbia University]], [[New York City|New York]], where she completed her thesis on [[macrosociology]] and its methodology. She returned to Vienna to work as an associate professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Studies (Vienna)|Institute for Advanced Studies]].<ref name="NowotnyLeroy2009" />

==Research and publications==
Nowotny's work in the 1970s and 1980s includes topics such as scientific controversies and technological [[risk]]s, social time, coping with [[uncertainty]], self-organization in science and [[gender]] relations in science, resulting in major monographs, co-edited and edited books and numerous articles. In 1989, she published the book ''Eigenzeit'' (English title: ''Time: The Modern and Postmodern Experience),'' which has since been translated into several languages.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Helga Nowotny awarded honorary doctorate|url = http://www.uib.no/en/svf/92065/helga-nowotny-awarded-honorary-doctorate|website = University of Bergen Faculty of Social Sciences|access-date = 2015-12-14|publisher = University of Bergen|date = 3 Oct 2015}}</ref>

Between 1992 and 1995 Helga Nowotny has been President of the [[International Society for the Study of Time]]. 
From the 1990s onwards she focused her research activities on new topics in [[sociology of science and technology|social studies of science and technology]]. She conducted an empirical study on the discovery of high-superconductivity research and its impact on research policy (with [[Ulrike Felt]]) and increasingly on the changing relationship between [[science]] and [[society]].

In 1994 Nowotny helped coin the term “Mode 2” for a new mode of applied research focused on solving specific problems. By contrast, “Mode 1” is basic research done within disciplines, initiated by the interest of the investigator, not from external demand.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Helga Nowotny, new president of European Research Council|url = http://www.en.globaltalentnews.com/current_news/reports/3123/Helga-Nowotny-new-president-of-European-Research-Council.html|website = www.en.globaltalentnews.com|access-date = 2015-12-14|publisher = GT Media}}</ref>
