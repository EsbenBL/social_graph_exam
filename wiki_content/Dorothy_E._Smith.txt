'''Dorothy Edith Smith''' {{postnominals|CM}} (born July 6, 1926) is a Canadian [[sociology|sociologist]] with research interests in a variety of disciplines, including [[women's studies]], [[feminist theory]], [[psychology]], and [[Education studies|educational studies]], as well as in certain subfields of sociology, such as the [[sociology of knowledge]], [[Sociology of the family|family studies]], and methodology. Smith founded the sociological sub-disciplines of [[feminist standpoint theory]] and [[institutional ethnography]].

==Biography==
Smith was born in July 1926, in [[Northallerton]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]],<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Smyth|first=Deirdre Mary|title=A Few Laced Genes: Sociology, the Women's Movement and the Work of Dorothy E.

Smith did her undergraduate work at the [[London School of Economics]], earning her B.Sc in Sociology with a Major in Social Anthropology in 1955. She then married William Reid Smith, whom she had met while attending LSE, and they moved to the United States.<ref name="UQAC">{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dorothy|title=Dorothy E.

Not long afterward she and her husband were divorced; she retained custody of the children. She then taught as a lecturer at UC Berkeley from 1964 to 1966.<ref>Wallace,R. & Wolf, A., "Contemporary Sociological Theory" 6th Edition (2006), Pearson Prentice-Hall. p. 297-298</ref> Dorothy started teaching sociology, and was the only woman teacher in a faculty of 44.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dorothy Smith: History & Feminist theory|url=https://schoolworkhelper.net/dorothy-smith-history-feminist-theory/|access-date=2021-10-21|website=SchoolWorkHelper|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1967 she moved with her two sons to [[Vancouver]] British Columbia to teach at the [[University of British Columbia]], where she helped to establish a Women's Studies Program. In 1977 she moved to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] to work at the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]], where she lived until she retired. In 1994 she became an adjunct professor at the [[University of Victoria]], where she continued her work in institutional ethnography. Smith serves on the international advisory board for the feminist journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/about-signs/masthead/|title=Masthead|date=2012-08-22|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}</ref> Smith's main focus was feminism and how there is poor behaviors against women that created a bias.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-03-08|title=Dorothy Edith Smith: History & Feminist theory|url=https://www.sociologygroup.com/dorothy-edith-smith/|access-date=2021-10-21|website=Sociology Group: Sociology and Other Social Sciences Blog|language=en-gb}}</ref> 

==Standpoint theory==
Before Smith, American feminist theorist [[Sandra Harding]] created the concept of standpoint theory in order to emphasize the knowledge of women, arguing that hierarchies naturally created ignorance about social reality and critical questions among those whom the hierarchies favored. However, those at the bottom of these ladders had a perspective that made it easier to explain social problems.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/standpoint-theory#ref1201414|title=Standpoint Theory|last=Borland|first=Elizabeth|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

It was during her time as a graduate student in the 1960s that Smith developed her notion of [[feminist standpoint theory|standpoint]], shaping Harding's theory. During this time, Smith recognized that she herself was experiencing "two subjectivities, home and university",<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Classical and Contemporary Sociological Theory: Readings and Text|last1 = Appelrouth|first1 = Scott|publisher = Pine Forge Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0761927938|last2 = Edles|first2 = Laura Delfor|edition = First|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/classicalcontemp0000appe}}</ref> and that these two worlds could not be blended. In recognition of her own standpoint, Smith shed light on the fact that sociology was lacking in the acknowledgment of standpoint.  At this point, the methods and theories of sociology had been formed upon and built in a male-dominated social world, unintentionally ignoring the women's world of sexual reproduction, children, and household affairs.<ref name=":0" /> Women’s duties are seen as natural parts of society, rather than as an addition to culture. Smith believed that asking questions from a female’s perspective could provide insight into social institutions.<ref name=":3" /> Smith determined that for minority groups,  the constant separation between the world as they experience it versus continually having to adapt to the view of the dominant group creates oppression, which can lead to members of the marginalized group feeling alienated from their "true" selves.<ref name=":0" />

=== Example ===
Smith often uses one particular story as an example of the importance of standpoint theory, and as a way of explaining it:

One day, while riding in a train in Ontario, Smith observed a family of Indians standing together by a river, watching the train pass by. It was only after having made these initial assumptions that Smith realized that they were just that; they were assumptions, assumptions that she had no way of knowing if they were true or not. She called them "Indians", but she couldn't have known, for sure, what their origins were. She called them a family, which could have very well not been true. She also said they were watching the train go by, an assumption that emerged solely based on her position in time and space, her position riding in the train, looking out at the "family".<ref name=":1">Smith, D. E. (1990). ''The conceptual practices of power: A feminist sociology of knowledge''. Boston: Northeastern University Press.</ref>

For Smith, this served as a representation of her own privilege, through which she made assumptions and immediately imposed them on the group of "Indians". It helped lead her to the conclusion that experiences differ, across space, time, and circumstance. It is unfair to create society—and ruling relations—based on only one point of view/being.<ref>Lemert, C. C. (2004). ''Social theory: The multicultural and classic readings'' (4th ed.). Boulder, CO: Westview Press.</ref>

== Institutional ethnography ==
{{Main|Institutional ethnography}}
Institutional ethnography (IE) is a sociological method of inquiry which Smith developed, created to explore the social relations that structure people's everyday lives. For the institutional ethnographer, ordinary daily activity becomes the site for an investigation of social organization. Smith developed IE as [[Marxist feminist]] sociology<ref name="Carpenter">{{cite web|last1=Carpenter|first1=Sara|last2=Mojab|first2=Shahrzad|title=Institutional ethnography: pursuing a Marxist-feminist analysis of consciousness|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/172300.pdf|website=Paper presented at the 38th Annual SCUTREA Conference, 2–4 July 2008 University of Edinburgh|access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref>

it is now used by researchers in the social sciences, in education, in human services and in policy research as a method for mapping the translocal relations that coordinate people's activities within institutions.<ref name="Trenerry">{{cite web|last1=Trenerry|first1=Ruth|title=A Portfolio of Research Career-work: An Institutional Ethnography exploring women's 'career' activity in the paid workplace|url=http://search.ror.unisa.edu.au/media/researcharchive/open/9915951817001831/53111917800001831|website=School of Education Division of Education, Arts and Social Sciences University of South Australia|date=2011|access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="Walby">{{cite journal|last1=Walby|first1=Kevin|title=On the Social Relations of Research|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|date=29 June 2016|volume=13|issue=7|pages=1008–1030|doi=10.1177/1077800407305809|s2cid=143598915}}</ref> Smith insisted that her outline of Institutional ethnography would be expanded upon in a collaborative manner amongst sociologists, emphasizing the networking needed to progress the idea<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=10.1525/sp.2006.53.3.294|title=Introduction: What is Institutional Ethnography?|journal=Social Problems|volume=53|issue=3|pages=294–298|doi=10.1525/sp.2006.53.3.294|last1=Devault|first1=Marjorie L.|year=2006}}</ref>

==Ruling relations==
Smith also developed the concept of ''ruling relations'', the institutional complexes that "coordinate the everyday work of administration and the lives of those subject to administrative regimes".<ref name=blackwellrulingrelations>{{cite web|last1=DeVault|first1=Marjorie|title=Ruling Relations|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433124_ss1-82|website=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology}}</ref> This allows a society to have control and organization, with examples being systems of bureaucracy and management<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/75/334 |title=Sexuality and the 'Relations of Ruling': Using Institutional Ethnography to Research Lesbian and Gay Foster Care and Adoption |last1=Hicks |first1=Stephen |journal=Social Work & Society |date=31 December 2009 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=234–245 |language=en |issn=1613-8953 |access-date=19 July 2020 }}</ref>

== Bifurcation of consciousness ==
Bifurcation is defined as dividing or separating into two parts or branches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bifurcation|url=http://wordnik.com/words/bifurcation|website=Wordnik.com|access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref> In the case of the bifurcation of consciousness, specifically related to standpoint theory, this refers to the separation of the two modes of being for women. Since sociology is a male-dominated field, women must fight to push past their expected roles as housewives and mothers, moving from the local realm of the home to the "extra local" realm of society.<ref>Mann, D. (2008). ''Understanding society: A survey of modern social theory''. Don Mills, Ont.: Oxford University Press.</ref> Women, therefore, split their consciousness in two in order to establish themselves as knowledgeable and competent beings within society and the field of sociology.<ref name="Bowell">{{cite web|last1=Bowell|first1=T.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-stan/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref>

== Influences ==
Smith has influential ties to theorists such as [[Karl Marx]] and [[Alfred Schütz]].<ref name=":0" /> Building on top of [[Marxist theory]], Smith evolves [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] into gender-stratified capitalism, explaining in her work ''Feminism and Marxism'' how "objective social, economic and political relations ... shape and determine women's oppression".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Feminism and Marxism: A Place to Begin, A Way to Go|last=Smith|first=Dorothy|publisher=New Star Books|year=1997|location=Vancouver}}</ref> From Schutz, Smith explains, "Individuals are experienced as 'types'",<ref name=":0" /> developing upon his concept of umwelt and mitwelt relations. In ''The Everyday World as Problematic: A Feminist Sociology'', Smith explains mitwelt and umwelt relations of male dominance claiming, "women's work conceals from men the actual concrete forms on which their work depends".<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=The Everyday World as Problematic: A Feminist Sociology|last=Smith|first=Dorothy|publisher=Northeastern University Press|year=1987}}</ref>

== Umwelt and mitwelt ==
[[Alfred Schütz]] describes mitwelt relationships as less intimate than umwelt relationships. Mitwelt relations refer more to a type of relation, such as an individual and their mail carrier. Umwelt relations are found on a more intimate level, such as a husband and wife. Smith extends these concepts by demonstrating how umwelt is more "central in women's lives, and men relegate their umwelt relations to women".<ref name=":0" />

==Professional recognition==
In recognition of her contributions in the "transformation of sociology", and for extending the boundaries of "feminist standpoint theory" to "include race, class, and gender", Smith received numerous awards from the [[American Sociological Association]], including the American Sociological Association's Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award (1999)<ref>{{cite web|title=Dorothy E.

== ''The Everyday World as Problematic: A Feminist Sociology (1987)'' ==
Smith wrote chapter 2 and 3 of ''The Everyday World as a Problematic: A Feminist Sociology'' in-between 1977-1981. Her concept of '''The Line of Fault''' is the notion of recognizing the male biases as a society and being conscious from a woman's perspective and noticing the inequality between male and female.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Dorothy E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLMJ5kCQ02YC&q=dorothy+e+smith+biography&pg=PA45|title=The Everyday World as Problematic: A Feminist Sociology|date=1987-01-01|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-6702-9|language=en}}</ref> In Toronto, while teaching at Ontario Institute of Studies, Smith published her paper about everyday lives as a woman, and the sociology behind the everyday housewife and mother.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dorothy Smith: History & Feminist theory|url=https://schoolworkhelper.net/dorothy-smith-history-feminist-theory/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=SchoolWorkHelper|language=en-US}}</ref>
