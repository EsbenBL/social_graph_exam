==Early life==
Gottschalk was born on December 17, 1958. She received her B.A. in history from [[Cornell University]], her M.P.A. from [[Princeton University]]’s [[Woodrow Wilson School]], and her M.A. and Ph.D. in political science from [[Yale University]].

==Career==

In the 1980s she spent two years in China as a university lecturer and published on international relationships between China and the United States under the Bush administration.<ref name="Gottschalk_Failure_1989">{{Cite journal| issn = 0740-2775| volume = 6| issue = 4| pages = 667–684| last = Gottschalk| first = Marie| title = The Failure of American Policy| journal = World Policy Journal | date = 1989| jstor = 40209129}}</ref> By 1992, after having worked as a journalist, she was associate editor of ''[[World Policy Journal]]'' (WPJ). In a 1992 WPJ article she echoed concerns expressed by ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' journalist, Colman McCarthy that the American media, which were under "unprecedented restrictions" during the [[Gulf War]], was—like the "American consumer, corporation and Congress"—being profoundly re-shaped by the Bush administration.<ref name="Colman_MediaDanced_19910317">{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| last = McCarthy| first = Colman| title = When the Media Danced to Jingo Bells| work = Washington Post |access-date=January 11, 2020| date = March 17, 1991| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/03/17/when-the-media-danced-to-jingo-bells/9a31971d-8c9d-4916-83af-a7581a360bfb/}}</ref><ref name="Gottschalk_Shadow_1992">{{Cite journal| issn = 0740-2775| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 449–486| last = Gottschalk| first = Marie| title = Operation Desert Cloud: The Media and the Gulf War| journal = World Policy Journal | date = 1992| jstor = 40209262}}</ref><ref name="Gottschalk_Shadow_19990601">{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press| isbn = 978-0-8014-8648-7| last = Gottschalk| first = Marie| title = The Shadow Welfare State: Labor, Business, and the Politics of Health-care in the United States| journal = Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law| date = June 1, 1999  | volume = 24| issue = 3| pages = 489–529| doi = 10.1215/03616878-24-3-489| pmid = 10386325|access-date=January 11, 2020 |url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-abstract/24/3/489/39473}}</ref> Before joining the University of Pennsylvania, she also worked as a visiting scholar at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] and as a [[Fulbright Program]] Distinguished Lecturer in [[Japan]]. She served on the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]' National Task Force on Mass Incarceration and the [[National Academy of Sciences]]' Committee on the Causes and Consequences of High Rates of Incarceration.<ref name=faculty>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sas.upenn.edu/polisci/people/standing-faculty/marie-gottschalk-0|title=Marie Gottschalk |website=University of Pennsylvania Political Science Department|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}</ref> She was featured in the [[Academy Award]]-nominated 2016 documentary ''[[13th (film)|13th]]''.<ref name="thedp_Imburgia_20170126"/>

==Selected publications==
In her widely cited 2006 book entitled, ''The Prison and the Gallows: The Politics of Mass Incarceration in America'',<ref name="Gottschalk_Gallows_2006">{{cite book |title=The prison and the gallows: the politics of mass incarceration in America |first=Marie |last=Gottschalk |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0521864275 |oclc=452916038|date=2006 |pages=451}}</ref> Gottschalk traced the nationalization and politicization of law and order, the relationship between power and punishment, the origins and construction of the [[carceral state]] in the United States from the 1920s through the 1960s, prison activism and prison rights, public policies in the penal system, and capital punishment.<ref name="Gottschalk_Gallows_2006"/>

In her 2008 ''[[Annual Review of Political Science]]'' article, "Hiding in Plain Sight: American Politics and the Carceral State", she traced the "emergence, consolidation and "explosive growth" of the American carceral state as a "major milestone in American political development", that was "unprecedented" among Western countries and in US history."<ref name="Gottschalk_Hiding_2008">{{cite journal |title=Hiding in Plain Sight: American Politics and the Carceral State |journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]] |volume=11 |pages=235–260|date=June 15, 2008 |doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135218 |last1=Gottschalk |first1=Marie |doi-access=free }}</ref>{{rp|235}}  She called for more research on the causes and consequences of the "retributive turn" in American penal policies. She described the carceral turn in academic research from the late 1990s onwards, with disciplines, such as criminology, sociology, law, and political science, investigating "politics and the origins of the carceral state." By the 2000s, new research expanded the scope of the literature on the carceral state to include its "political consequences" and to analyse its implications. The sheer size of the carceral state was beginning to "transform fundamental democratic institutions." According to Gottschalk,  democratic "free and fair elections" and "accurate and representative census" were no longer assured. The literature on American politics and the carceral state which has expanded far beyond criminal justice, included "voter turnout", the "vanishing voter," the role of [[neoliberalism]] in the economic policies of the 1990s, and the rise of the national Republican Party. She wrote that this new "scholarship on the carceral state" also raises concerns regarding "power and resistance for marginalized and stigmatized groups."<ref name="Gottschalk_Hiding_2008"/>{{rp|235}}

Her 2014 online publication, ''Caught'', Gottschalk, was a scathing critique of the American carceral state, which she described as "metastasizing". She investigated the carceral phenomenon through the lens of race, sex offenders, political and economic inequality, the criminalization of immigration, recidivism, and the continuum of the carceral network beyond prison walls.<ref name="Gottschalk_Caught_2014">{{citation |title=Caught |first=Marie |last=Gottschalk |date=2014 |oclc=900396421 |isbn=978-0691164052 |url=https://archive.org/details/caughtt_got_2015_00_7661 |url-access=registration }}</ref> It was re-published with the title, ''Caught: the Prison State and the Lockdown of American Politics'', by [[Princeton University Press]] in 2016.<ref name="Gottschalk_Caught_2016">{{cite book |title=Caught: the Prison State and the Lockdown of American Politics |first=Marie |last=Gottschalk |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2016}}</ref> She examined the impact of the [[Great Recession]]—the financial crisis of 2007–2008—<ref name=Appelbaum>{{cite news |last1 = Binyamin |first1 = Appelbaum |title = Fed Says Growth Lifts the Affluent, Leaving Behind Everyone Else |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/business/economy/least-affluent-families-incomes-are-declining-fed-survey-shows.html |access-date = September 13, 2014 |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = September 4, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=Chokshi>{{cite news |last1 = Chokshi |first1 = Niraj |title = Income inequality seems to be rising in more than 2 in 3 metro areas |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/11/income-inequality-seems-to-be-rising-in-more-than-2-in-3-metro-areas/ |access-date = September 13, 2014 |work = [[The Washington Post]] |date = August 11, 2014 }}</ref> on the "Great Confinement".<ref name="Gottschalk_Caught_2016"/>

In the first chapter Gottschalk described how "a tenacious carceral state has sprouted in the shadows of mass imprisonment and has been extending its reach far beyond the prison gate. It includes not only the country’s vast archipelago of jails and prisons, but also the far-reaching and growing penal punishments and controls that lies in the never-never land between the prison gate and full citizenship. As it sunders families and communities and radically reworks conceptions of democracy, rights, and citizenship, the carceral state poses a formidable political and social challenge." She said that until the carceral turn in the social sciences in the late 1990s, "mass imprisonment was largely an invisible issue in the United States". By 2014, there was widespread criticism of mass incarceration but very modest reform.<ref name="Gottschalk_Caught_2016"/>
