=== "Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches", 1995===
In his article "Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches'", Suchman defines legitimacy as "a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions."<ref name="Suchman">{{cite journal|last1=Suchman|first1=Mark|title=Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches|journal=The Academy of Management Review |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=571–610 |doi=10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331}}</ref>

He later adds to this definition, stating that because legitimacy is socially conferred, legitimacy is independent of individual participants, while dependent upon the collective constituency. In other words, an organization is legitimate when it enjoys public approval, even though the actions of an organization might deviate from particular individual interests.<ref name=Suchman/>

Suchman states three types of legitimacy: 
* pragmatic legitimacy, 
* moral legitimacy, and 
* cognitive legitimacy.

=== Pragmatic legitimacy ===
Pragmatic legitimacy relies upon the self-interests of an organizations constituencies, in which the constituency scrutinizes actions and behaviors taken by the organization in order to determine their effects.<ref name=Suchman/> This is further broken down into three sub-sections: 
* exchange legitimacy, 
* influence legitimacy, and 
* dispositional legitimacy. 
Suchman defines exchange legitimacy as the support for organizational policies due to the policy's benefit to the constituencies.<ref name=Suchman/><ref name=Heidhues>{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92}}</ref>

Influence legitimacy is the support for the organization not due to the benefits that constituencies believe they will receive, but rather due to their belief that the organization will be responsive to their larger interests.<ref name=Suchman/><ref name=Heidhues/>

Dispositional legitimacy is defined as support for an organization due to the good attributes constituencies believe the organization has, such as trustworthy, decent, or wise.<ref name=Suchman/><ref name=Heidhues/> This is due to the fact that people typically personify organizations and characterize them as being autonomous.<ref name=Suchman/>

=== Moral legitimacy ===
Moral legitimacy is dependent upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral.<ref name=Suchman/> In other words, if the constituency  believe the organization is breaking the rules of the political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy.<ref name=Yankelovich>{{cite journal|last1=Yankelovich|first1=Daniel|title=A Crisis of Moral Legitimacy|date=1974|page=5}}</ref> Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections:
* consequential legitimacy, 
* procedural legitimacy, 
* structural legitimacy, and 
* personal legitimacy. 
Consequential legitimacy relates to what an organization has accomplished based on criteria that is specific to that organization. Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight). In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work.<ref name=Suchman/><ref name=Heidhues/><ref name=Brinkerhoff>{{cite journal |last1=Brinkerhoff |first1=Derick |title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22}}</ref>

Suchman refers to this organization as being the "right organization for the job."<ref name=Suchman/> Lastly, personal legitimacy refers to legitimacy that is derived from the charisma of individual leaders.<ref name=Suchman/><ref name=Heidhues/><ref name=Brinkerhoff/>

=== Cognitive legitimacy ===
Cognitive legitimacy is created when an organization pursues goals that society deems to be proper and desirable.<ref name=Brinkerhoff/>
Constituency support for the organization is not due to self-interest, but rather due to its taken-for-granted character.<ref name=Suchman/><ref name=Chaison>{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|url=https://archive.org/details/unionslegitimacy00chai|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/unionslegitimacy00chai/page/10 10]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sun |first1=William |last2=Louche |first2=Céline|last3=Pérez|first3=Roland|title=Finance and Sustainability: Towards a New Paradigm? A Post-Crisis Agenda|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|date=2011|page=152}}</ref> When an organization has reached this taken-for-granted status, an organization is beyond dissent.<ref name=Suchman/><ref name=Chaison /> While moral and pragmatic legitimacy deal with some form of evaluation, cognitive legitimacy does not. Instead, with cognitive legitimacy society accepts these organizations as being necessary or inevitable.<ref name=Brinkerhoff/><ref name=Chaison/>
