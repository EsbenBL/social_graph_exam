'''Ernst Friedrich Schumacher''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|size=100%}} (16 August 1911 – 4 September 1977) was a German-British [[statistician]] and [[economist]] who is best known for his proposals for human-scale, [[Decentralization|decentralised]] and [[appropriate technology|appropriate technologies]].<ref name=SiBbiog>Biography on the inner dustjacket of ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]''</ref> He served as Chief Economic Advisor to the British [[National Coal Board]] from 1950 to 1970, and founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now known as [[Practical Action]]) in 1966.

In 1995, his 1973 book ''[[Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered]]'' was ranked by ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' as one of the 100 most influential books published since World War II.<ref name=TLS100>The Times Literary Supplement, 6 October 1995, p. 39</ref> In 1977 he published ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'' as a critique of [[Materialism|materialistic]] [[scientism]] and as an exploration of the nature and organisation of [[knowledge]].

==Early life==
Schumacher was born in [[Bonn]], Germany in 1911. His father was a professor of [[political economy]]. The younger Schumacher studied in Bonn and [[Berlin]], then from 1930 in England as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] at [[New College, Oxford]],<ref name=SiBbiog/> and later at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], earning a diploma in economics. He then worked in business, farming and journalism.<ref name=SiBbiog/> His sister, Elizabeth, was the wife of the physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]].

==Economist==

===Protégé of Keynes===
Schumacher moved back to England prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. For a period during the war, he was [[interned]] on an isolated English farm as an "enemy alien". In these years, Schumacher captured the attention of [[John Maynard Keynes]] with a paper entitled "Multilateral Clearing"<ref>[http://www.centerforneweconomics.org/content/multilateral-clearing E. F. Schumacher, "Multilateral Clearing"] ''Economica'', New Series, Vol. 10, No. 38 (May 1943), pp. 150–165</ref> that he had written between sessions working in the fields of the internment camp. Keynes recognised the young German's understanding and abilities, and he was able to have Schumacher released from internment. Schumacher helped the [[British government]] mobilise economically and financially during World War II, and Keynes found a position for him at [[Oxford University]].

According to [[Leopold Kohr]]'s obituary for Schumacher, when "Multilateral Clearing" "was published in the spring of 1943 in ''[[Economica]]'', it caused some embarrassment to Keynes who, instead of arranging for its separate publication, had incorporated the text almost verbatim in his famous "[[Plan for an International Clearing Union]]", which the British government issued as a [[White Paper]] a few weeks later."<ref>Leopold Kohr.{{cite web |url=http://www.schumacher.org.uk/about_efschumacher.htm |title=Tribute to E. F. Schumacher |access-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011020125/http://www.schumacher.org.uk/about_efschumacher.htm |archive-date=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}, in Satish Kumar (ed.), ''The Schumacher Lectures'', [[Harper & Row]], 1980.</ref>

===Adviser to the Coal Board===
After the War, Schumacher worked as an economic advisor to, and later Chief Statistician for, the [[Allied Commission|British Control Commission]], which was charged with rebuilding the [[German economy]].<ref name=SiBbiog/> From 1950 to 1970 he was Chief Economic Adviser to the [[National Coal Board]],<ref name=SiBbiog/> one of the world's largest organisations, with 800,000 employees. In this position, he argued that coal, not petroleum, should be used to supply the energy needs of the world's population. He saw oil as a [[finite resource]], fearing its depletion and eventually prohibitive [[price]], and viewed with alarm the reality that "the richest and cheapest reserves are located in some of the world's most unstable countries".<ref>Daniel Yergin. ''The Prize'', Simon & Schuster, 1991, p.&nbsp;559.</ref>

His position on the Coal Board was often mentioned later by those introducing Schumacher or his ideas. It is generally thought that his farsighted planning contributed to Britain's post-war economic recovery. Schumacher predicted the rise of [[OPEC]] and many of the problems of [[nuclear power]].<ref>''Small Is Beautiful'' Section 2, Chapters 3-4. Schumaker, EF. Harper and Row Publishers. 1989.</ref>

===Thinking outside the box===
In 1955 Schumacher travelled to [[Burma]] as an economic consultant. While there, he developed the set of principles he called "[[Buddhist economics]]", based on the belief that individuals need good work for proper [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]. He also proclaimed that "production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life." He travelled throughout many [[Third World]] countries, encouraging local governments to create [[self-reliant economy|self-reliant economies]]. Schumacher's experience led him to become a pioneer of what is now called [[appropriate technology]]: [[user-friendly]] and [[ecologically]] suitable technology applicable to the scale of the community; a concept very close to [[Ivan Illich]]'s conviviality. He founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now [[Practical Action]]) in 1966. His theories of development have been summed up for many in catch phrases such as        "[[intermediate size]]", and "[[intermediate technology]]". He was a [[trustee]] of [[Scott Bader Commonwealth]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottbader.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926073000/http://www.scottbader.com/governance.html|url-status=dead|title=Scott Bader|archive-date=26 September 2012|website=Scott Bader|access-date=20 September 2019}}</ref> and in 1970 the president of the [[Soil Association]].

E. F. Schumacher was greatly influenced by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[J. C. Kumarappa]] and Gandhi's concepts of "economy of permanence" and appropriate technology. While delivering the Gandhi Memorial Lecture at the Gandhian Institute of Studies at [[Varanasi]] (India) in 1973, Schumacher described Gandhi as the greatest "people's economist" whose economic thinking was compatible with spirituality as opposed to materialism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gandhifoundation.org/2008/09/07/surur-hoda-1928-2003/ |title=Surur Hoda (1928–2003) |website=Gandhi Foundation|date=7 September 2008}}</ref>

=== Influence ===
Schumacher was influenced by [[Richard Henry Tawney]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Leopold Kohr]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John Ruskin]] and the [[Catholic Church]] throughout his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schumacher-haney.info/chapter-13|title=Chapter 12: Influences - E. F. Schumacher: Ideas That Matter|website=www.schumacher-haney.info|access-date=20 September 2019}}</ref> He and his solutions to the great economic problems influence the [[E. F. Schumacher Society]], The Arche, George McRobie, William Schweke, and many others.{{CN|date=April 2020}}

==Schumacher as writer==
Schumacher wrote on economics for London's ''[[The Times]]'' and became one of the paper's chief [[editorial board|editorial writers]]. At this post he was assigned the task of compiling information for the obituary of John Maynard Keynes. He also wrote for ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Resurgence & Ecologist|Resurgence]]''. He served as adviser to the [[India Planning Commission]], as well as to the governments of Zambia and Burma – an experience that led to his much-read essay "Buddhist Economics".

The 1973 publication of ''[[Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered]]'', a collection of essays, finished in the house of his friend Leopold Kohr, brought his ideas to a wider audience. One of his main arguments in ''Small Is Beautiful'' is that we cannot consider the problem of technological production solved if it requires that we recklessly erode our finite [[natural capital]] and deprive future generations of its benefits. Schumacher's work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism, and he became a hero to many in the [[environmental movement]] and [[community movement]].

In 1976, he was awarded the [[:fr:Prix Européen de l'Essai Charles Veillon|Prix Européen de l'Essai Charles Veillon]] for ''Small Is Beautiful''.

His 1977 work ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'' is both a critique of [[materialism|materialistic]] [[scientism]] and an exploration of the nature and organisation of knowledge.

==Later life==
As a young man, Schumacher was a dedicated atheist, but his later rejection of materialist, capitalist, agnostic modernity was paralleled by a growing fascination with religion.<ref>Diana Schumacher. [http://gandhifoundation.org/2011/11/25/who-was-fritz-schumacher-by-diana-schumacher/ "Who was Fritz Schumacher?"]</ref><ref>Julia Forster. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090430013731/http://resurgence.opendemocracy.net/index.php/Schumacher%2C_E.F. "E. F. Schumacher"]</ref> He developed an interest in Buddhism, but beginning in the late-1950s, [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] heavily influenced his thinking. He noted the similarities between his own economic views and the teaching of papal [[Encyclical|encyclicals]] on socio-economic issues, from [[Leo XIII]]'s "[[Rerum novarum]]" to [[Pope John XXIII]]'s ''[[Mater et magistra]]'', as well as with the [[distributism]] supported by the Catholic thinkers [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], and [[Vincent McNabb]]. Philosophically, he absorbed much of [[Thomism]], which provided an objective system in contrast to what he saw as the self-centered [[subjectivism]] and [[relativism]] of modern philosophy and society.<ref>Charles Fager. [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1151 "Small Is Beautiful, and So Is Rome: The Surprising Faith of E. F. Schumacher"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620095357/http://religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1151 |date=20 June 2010 }}, ''[[Christian Century]]'', 6 April 1977.</ref> He also was greatly interested in the tradition of [[Christian mysticism]] and read deeply such writers as St. [[Teresa of Avila]] and [[Thomas Merton]]. These were all interests that he shared with his friend, the Catholic writer [[Christopher Derrick]]. In 1971, he converted to Catholicism.<ref>Pearce, Joseph (2008). [http://oldarchive.godspy.com/issues/The-Education-and-Catholic-Conversion-of-E-F-Schumacher-by-Joseph-Pearce.cfm.html "The Education of E.F. Schumacher"]. God Spy.</ref>

Schumacher gave interviews and published articles for a wide readership in his later years. He also pursued one of the loves of his life: gardening. He died of a [[heart attack]] on 4 September 1977, on arrival at Billens hospital in [[Romont]], Switzerland; after falling ill on a train in Zurich during a [[lecture tour]].<ref> The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/06/archives/ef-schumacher-66-economist-who-believed-that-small-is-beautiful.html 6 September 1977</ref>

==Legacy==
Schumacher's personal collection of books and archives is held by the [[Schumacher Center for a New Economics]] library in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]]. The center continues the work of Schumacher by maintaining a research library, organising lectures and seminars, publishing papers, developing model economic programs, and providing technical assistance to groups all for the purpose of linking people, land, and community to build strong, diverse local economies.<ref>[http://centerforneweconomics.org/ Schumacher Center for a New Economics web site].</ref>
