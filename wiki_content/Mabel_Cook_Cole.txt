<!-- (Mabel was my mother's first cousin, once removed, and mother knew her well. I did not have that pleasure but am in touch with her grandsons who are my third cousins. My mother was an excellent oral historian, and, combined with the local resources cited, I feel I am offering true information. Her husband, Fay-Cooper Cole was very famous in the field and wrote many books of value in anthropology,history education, and philippine history.
