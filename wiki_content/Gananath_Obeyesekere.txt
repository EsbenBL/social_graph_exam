'''Gananath Obeyesekere''' is Emeritus Professor of [[Anthropology]] at [[Princeton University]] and has done much work in his home country of [[Sri Lanka]].

==Career==
Professor Obeyesekere completed a B.A. in English (1955) at the [[University of Peradeniya|University of Ceylon, Peradeniya]], followed by an M.A. (1958) and Ph.D (1964) at the [[University of Washington]]. Before his appointment to Princeton, Obeyesekere held teaching positions at the [[University of Ceylon]], the University of Washington and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Debate with Sahlins==
In the 1990s he entered into a [[Sahlinsâ€“Obeyesekere debate|well-known intellectual debate]] with [[Marshall Sahlins]] over the rationality of indigenous peoples. The debate was carried out through an examination of the details of [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook's]] death in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1779. At the heart of the debate was how to understand the rationality of indigenous people. Obeyesekere insisted that indigenous people thought in essentially the same way as [[Westerners]] and was concerned that any argument otherwise would paint them as "irrational" and "uncivilized". In contrast Sahlins argued that each culture may have different types of rationality that make sense of the world by focusing on different patterns and explain them within specific cultural narratives, and that assuming that all cultures lead to a single rational view is a form of [[eurocentrism]].<ref name=Moore>Moore, Jerry D. 2009.
