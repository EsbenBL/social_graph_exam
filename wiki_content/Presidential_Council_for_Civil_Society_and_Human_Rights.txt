== Criticism ==
On October 5, 2009, the Council issued a statement condemning the actions of the ''[[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]]'' activists against journalist [[Alexander Podrabinek]]. The original version of the statement, posted on the Council's website, did not condemned Podrabinek's frank statements towards WWII veterans. However, the statement was later edited (according to some sources, after a call from a high-ranking official to [[Ella Pamfilova]]) and included remarks that the Council did not agree with Podrabinek's position. Valery Fadeyev, future chairman of the council, described its behavior within Podrabinek controversy as strange and unnatural.
{{Quote|A body that should contribute to the prevention of conflicts, to act as an independent arbiter in disputes, suddenly endorses one of the parties. And this only fuels the conflict. The story with a statement made on behalf of the Council without the consent of its individual members also looks absurd."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsinfo.ru/articles/2009-10-09/723341/|title=Совет, возглавляемый Памфиловой, ведет себя странно|lang=ru|trans-title=Pamfilova-led Council is behaving strangely|date=2009-10-09}}</ref>}}

Journalist [[Maksim Shevchenko (journalist)|Maksim Shevchenko]], who was a member of the Council in 2012–18, described its activities as follows:
{{Quote|All the activities of the council turned into the creation of the useless [[Public Television of Russia|OTR]] and the [[Wall of Grief|memorial to the victims of political repressions]]. But I don’t remember any specific actions to protect human rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://portal-kultura.ru/articles/opinions/294950-pomogal-detyam-i-delo-s-kontsom/|title=Помогал детям, и дело с концом|lang=ru|trans-title=He helped the children, and that's the end of it|last=Kolobrodov|first=Alexey|date=2019-10-31|website=Culture Gazette}}</ref>}}
