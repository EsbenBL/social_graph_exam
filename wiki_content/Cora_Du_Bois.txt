After retirement from Radcliffe, she was Professor-at-large at [[Cornell University]] (1971–1976) and for one term at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (1976).<ref name=Harvard />

She was elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1955,<ref name="AAAS">{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=July 22, 2014}}</ref> president of the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1968–1969, and of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 1969–1970, the first woman to be allowed that honor.<ref name="nytobit" />

==Early life and education==
Du Bois was born in New York City on October 26, 1903, to Mattie Schreiber Du Bois and Jean Du Bois, immigrants to the U.S. from [[Switzerland]]. She spent most of her childhood in [[New Jersey]], where she graduated from high school in [[Perth Amboy]]. She spent a year studying library science at the New York Public Library and then attended [[Barnard College]], graduating with a B.A. in history in 1927. She earned an M.A. in history from [[Columbia University]] in 1928.

Encouraged by an anthropology course taught by [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Franz Boas]] at Columbia, Du Bois moved to California to study anthropology with Native American specialists [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] and [[Robert Lowie]]. She received her Ph.D. in anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1932. Du Bois’s doctoral dissertation, “Girls’ Adolescence Observations in North America” covered the topic of puberty and menstrual customs and how they are viewed among Native Americans. The topic was recommended by a fellow graduate student, but she considered it a very dull and tedious library job.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Seymour|first=Susan C.|title=Cora Du Bois: Anthropologist, Diplomat, Agent|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2015|isbn=978- 0- 8032- 7430- 3|location=Nebraska|pages=93–94}}</ref> Du Bois was more interested in the question of the dividing line between cultural behavior and psychologically foundational human behavior, and thought this specific physiological condition (menstruation) would be a good place to study this question. However, there wasn’t sufficient data available to her at that time.<ref name=":0" />

==Early work==
In part due to prejudices against women academics, she was initially unable to find a university position. She remained at Berkeley as a teaching fellow and research assistant from 1932 to 1935. In 1932, Du Bois’s Tolowa Notes was published in American Anthropologist. This article explored the culture of the Tolowa people, with data from Agnes Mattez, a full blooded Tolowa woman of forty-five.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=DuBois|first=Cora A.|date=1932|title=Tolowa Notes|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/661654|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=34|issue=2|pages=248–262|issn=0002-7294}}</ref> Subjects discussed in the text include the puberty and marriage preparation ceremonies for girls. The puberty ceremony includes the piercing of the girl’s nasal septum and fasting, while the marriage ceremony includes bride prices discussed before marriage, and the presentation of gifts to the prospective mother-in-law.<ref name=":1" />

She conducted salvage ethnography on several Native American groups of northern California and the Pacific Northwest, including the [[Wintu]] Indians of northern California. This endeavor was published as A Study of Wintu Myths in The Journal of American Folklore. Its main focus is on how the Wintu myths changed or remained stable. In the study, Du Bois and her co-author [[Dorothy D. Lee|Dorothy Demetracopoulou]] divided the data into different groups, including the literary aspects of the mythology, the recorded myth, which includes the determination of the time and language factors of recording, and change and stability in Wintu mythology.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Demetracopoulou|first=D.|last2=du Bois|first2=Cora|date=1932|title=A Study of Wintu Mythology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/535747|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=45|issue=178|pages=373–500|doi=10.2307/535747|issn=0021-8715}}</ref> Of the stories discussed in the text, there are three main categories. First are the bolas, which take up the bulk of storytelling. Second are the ninas, which are based on love songs. The third and final type are anecdotes, which is a name used by the researchers themselves, not the Wintu.<ref name=":2" />&nbsp; Certain beliefs of the Wintu were also discussed, such as the stories having an effect on the weather if not told at the right time. She published ''The 1870 Ghost Dance'' in 1939, a study of a [[Ghost Dance|religious movement among Native Americans in the Western U.S.]]

In 1935, Du Bois received a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Fellowship to undertake clinical training and explore possible collaborations between anthropology and psychiatry. She spent six months at the [[Boston Psychopathic Hospital]], now the [[Massachusetts Mental Health Center]], and six months at the [[New York Psychoanalytic Society]]. In New York she worked with psychiatrist [[Abram Kardiner]], who became her mentor and collaborator for several projects in cross-cultural diagnosis and the psychoanalytic study of culture. Du Bois also taught at [[Hunter College]] in 1936–1937 while developing a fieldwork project to test their new ideas.

Published in 1937, Du Bois’s&nbsp; Some Anthropological Perspectives on Psychoanalysis discussed the relationship between Anthropology and Psychoanalysis. Du Bois stated that The first anthropological theory was a biological outgrowth of a biological analogy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bois|first=C. D.|date=1937|title=Some Anthropological Perspectives on Psychoanalysis|url=https://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=psar.024c.0246a|journal=Psychoanal. Rev.|pages=246–263}}</ref>

==Work in Indonesia and OSS==
From 1937 to 1939, Du Bois lived and conducted research on the island of [[Alor Island|Alor]], part of the [[Dutch East Indies]], now [[Indonesia]]. She collected detailed case studies, life-history interviews, and administered various personality tests (including [[Rorschach test]]s), which she interpreted in collaboration with Kardiner and published as ''The People of Alor: A Social-Psychological Study of an East Indian Island'' in 1944. One of her major theoretical advances in this work was the concept of "modal personality structure". With this notion she modified earlier ideas in the Culture and Personality school of anthropology on "basic personality structure" by demonstrating that, while there is always individual variation within a culture, each culture favors the development of a particular type or types, which will be the most common within that culture.<ref>Christina Toren, "Culture and Personality" in ''Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology'' (London: Routledge, 1996)</ref> Her work strongly influenced other psychiatric anthropologists, including [[Robert I. Levy (anthropologist)|Robert I. Levy]], with his [[person-centered ethnography]], and [[Melford Spiro]].

Like many other American social scientists during World War II, Du Bois served as a member of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) working in the Research and Analysis Branch as Chief of the Indonesia section. In 1944 she moved to Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) to serve as chief of research and analysis for the Army's Southeast Asia Command.<ref name="nytobit" />

For her service to the country in the OSS, Du Bois received the [[Department of the Army Distinguished Civilian Service Award|Exceptional Civilian Service Award]] from the [[United States Army]] in 1946. The Thai government honored her with the [[Order of the Crown of Thailand]] in 1949 for her efforts during the war on behalf of Thailand.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seymour|first1=Susan C.|title=Cora Du Bois: Anthropologist, Diplomat, Agent|date=2015|pages=203–204, 202|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=978-0-8032-6295-9}}</ref>

==Later work and Harvard career==
She left the OSS after World War II and from 1945 to 1949 was Southeast Asia Branch Chief in the State Department's Office of Intelligence Research.<ref name="nytobit" /> In 1950, she declined an appointment to succeed Kroeber as head of the anthropology department at Berkeley rather than sign the [[Levering Act|California Loyalty Oath]] required of all faculty members.<ref name=Harvard /> Du Bois worked for the [[World Health Organization]] in 1950–1951.  In 1954, she accepted an appointment at [[Harvard University]] as the second person to be the [[Samuel Zemurray, Jr. and Doris Zemurray Stone-Radcliffe Professor|Samuel Zemurray Jr. and Doris Zemurray Stone-Radcliffe Professor]] at [[Radcliffe College]]. She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1955.<ref name="AAAS">{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=July 22, 2014}}</ref> She was the first woman tenured in Harvard's Anthropology Department in 1954 and the second woman tenured in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard. During this time, Du Bois wrote The Dominant Value Profile of American Culture, with the goal of describing the views on American values and the ideas that can be drawn from them. In this text, she discussed how oppositional propositions are used in America. Since most of them are more spurious than genuine, they lack consistency and are thereby unhelpful in describing American values. The four basic premises and three focal values that can be drawn from them are key information in this work. The four basic premises are 1) the universe is mechanistically conceived, 2) man is its master, 3) men are equal, and 4) men are perfectible.<ref name="Harvard" /> The three focal values that can be drawn from them are “material well-being that derives from the premise that man is a master of a mechanistic universe; conformity that derives from the premise of man’s equality; effort-optimism that derives from man’s perfectibility.<ref name="du Bois 1955 1232–1239">{{Cite journal|last=du Bois|first=Cora|date=1955|title=The Dominant Value Profile of American Culture|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/665967|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=57|issue=6|pages=1232–1239|issn=0002-7294}}</ref> Du Bois asserts that these assumptions have proved valid for the American middle class over the last 300, and expects that to continue in the future.<ref name="du Bois 1955 1232–1239"/>

She reviewed widely. In 1950 wrote that ''The Kalingas, Their Institutes, and Custom Law'' by R.F. Barton was believed to be one of his best pieces on the customary laws of the Philippines Tribes in the Mountain Province of Luzon.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Vol. 52, No. 1, Jan. - Mar., 1950 of American Anthropologist on JSTOR|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/i227342|access-date=2021-05-24|website=www.jstor.org|language=en}}</ref> In 1957, she reviewed ''Chinese Society in Thailand: An Analytical History'' by [[G. William Skinner]], comparing it to works by [[Victor Purcell]] and [[Kenneth Landon]]. Du Bois described Purcell's work as a monumental compilation.<ref name="DuBois 1957 170–171">{{Cite journal|last=DuBois|first=Cora|date=1957|title=Review of Chinese Society in Thailand: An Analytical History|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1031864|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=314|pages=170–171|issn=0002-7162}}</ref>

She conducted research between 1961 and 1967 in the temple city of [[Bhubaneswar]] in the Indian state of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], where a number of graduate students in Anthropology and [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Social Relations]] conducted fieldwork.

In 1970 she retired from Harvard but continued teaching as Professor-at-large at [[Cornell University]] (1971–1976) and for one term at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (1976).<ref name=Harvard /> Most of her research materials and personal papers are held in the [[Tozzer Library]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=Harvard /> Some are in the [[Regenstein Library]] at the [[University of Chicago]].

==Personal life==
Du Bois met [[Jeanne Taylor]], another OSS employee, in Ceylon. There she began a [[lesbian]] relationship with her.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seymour|first1=Susan C.|title=Cora Du Bois: Anthropologist, Diplomat, Agent|date=2015|page=420|chapter=Index: Taylor, Jeanne|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=978-0-8032-6295-9}}</ref> They lived together as a couple<ref name=Levine>{{cite magazine|last1=Levine|first1=Robert A.|title=Special intelligence |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/special-intelligence/|magazine=[[Times Literary Supplement]]|date=22 July 2016|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref> and in the mid-1950s they visited [[Paul Cushing Child|Paul]] and [[Julia Child]] in Paris.<ref name=Conant>{{cite book|last1=Conant|first1=Jennet|title=A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS|url=https://archive.org/details/covertaffairjuli00cona|url-access=registration|date=2011|page=[https://archive.org/details/covertaffairjuli00cona/page/241 241]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-6352-8}}</ref> Du Bois' obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Taylor "her longtime companion."<ref name="nytobit" /> Du Bois and Taylor, according to her [[Harvard Library]] biography, "enjoyed an active social life" together.<ref name=Harvard />
