=== Research and publications ===
Yellen has had a remarkable academic career, largely focused on analysis of the mechanisms of unemployment and labor markets, monetary and fiscal policies, and international trade. She's written a few widely cited papers, often collaborating with her husband professor George Akerlof on research.<ref name="Matthews WP">{{cite news |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |date=October 13, 2013 |title=Seventeen academic papers of Janet Yellen's that you need to read |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/09/seventeen-academic-papers-of-janet-yellens-that-you-need-to-read/ |url-status=live |work=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190919132958/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/09/seventeen-academic-papers-of-janet-yellens-that-you-need-to-read/ |archive-date=September 19, 2019 |access-date=October 14, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=McGrane |first=Victoria |date=October 9, 2013 |title=A Look at Yellen's Research: Unemployment, Advertising and Out-of-Wedlock Births |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-20791 |url-status=live |work=The Wall Street Journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210526125945/https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-20791 |archive-date=May 26, 2021 |access-date=October 10, 2013}}</ref>

Since 1982, Yellen with Akerlof address what's known in the economics literature as "efficiency wage theory"{{snd}}the idea that paying people more than the market wage does, in fact, increase their productivity.

Another important work, "An Analysis of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States" co-written with Akerlof and Michael Katz and published in 1996, aims to explain why out of wedlock births had grown considerably in previous decades in the United States. Research study led to a theory called "reproductive technology shock," arguing that the increased availability of both abortion and contraception in the late 1960s and early 1970s eroded the social norms surrounding sex, pregnancy and marriage, leading to a sharp decline in the stigma of unwed motherhood.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-mothers-not-married-technology-shock-the-demise-of-shotgun-marriage-and-the-increase-in-out-of-wedlock-births/ |title=New mothers, not married: Technology shock, the demise of shotgun marriage, and the increase in out-of-wedlock births |last1=Akerlof |first1=George |last2=Yellen |first2=Janet |date=September 1, 1996 |website=Brookings |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327195339/https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-mothers-not-married-technology-shock-the-demise-of-shotgun-marriage-and-the-increase-in-out-of-wedlock-births/ |archive-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=live |access-date=January 15, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/an-analysis-of-out-of-wedlock-births-in-the-united-states/ |title=An analysis of out-of-wedlock births in the United States |last1=Akerlof |first1=George |last2=Yellen |first2=Janet |date=August 1, 1996 |website=Brookings |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114192124/https://www.brookings.edu/research/an-analysis-of-out-of-wedlock-births-in-the-united-states/ |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=January 15, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/1996/11/why-kids-have-kids.html |title=Why Kids Have Kids |last1=Akerlof |first1=George A. |last2=Yellen |first2=Janet L. |date=November 16, 1996 |website=Slate |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210608121501/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/1996/11/why-kids-have-kids.html |archive-date=June 8, 2021 |url-status=live |access-date=January 15, 2001}}</ref>

In July 1996, the Federal Reserve under Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], resisted pressure to raise [[interest rate]]s as unemployment declined.

During her time with the Council of Economic Advisors, Yellen oversaw a landmark report "Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap" focused on the gender pay divide in June 1998. Within this study, the Council analyzed data from 1969 to 1996 to determine the cause for women to earn substantially less than men. By observing trends attributable to issues like occupation/industry as well as familial status, it was determined that while the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] was a step forward, there was no explanation as to why there was a 25 percent difference between average pay for women and men – an improvement from the 40 percent gap two decades earlier. It was concluded that this gap had no correlation with differences in productivity and, as such, was the repercussions of discrimination within the workforce.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--> |title=Explaining Trends In The Gender Wage Gap |url=https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112163200/https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html |archive-date=November 12, 2019 |website=clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov |date=June 10, 1998 |access-date=January 21, 2001}}</ref><ref name="DP2">{{cite news |date=February 3, 2014 |title=Fed Chair Janet Yellen prefers to quietly break gender barriers |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/03/fed-chair-janet-yellen-prefers-to-quietly-break-gender-barriers/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201229201540/https://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/03/fed-chair-janet-yellen-prefers-to-quietly-break-gender-barriers/ |archive-date=December 29, 2020 |access-date=February 5, 2014 |work=The Denver Post |agency=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref name="Mui WP" />

Yellen is widely considered to be a "[[Monetary hawk and dove|dove]]" on [[monetary policy]] (i.e., more concerned with unemployment than with inflation) and as such generally favoring lower, rather than higher, Federal Reserve interest rates.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1214819920100312 |title=Yellen, Raskin and Diamond eyed for Fed board |last1=Bull |first1=Alister |last2=Felsenthal |first2=Mark |date=March 12, 2010 |website=Reuters |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201123211818/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1214819920100312 |archive-date=November 23, 2020 |url-status=live |access-date=March 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Cassidy |first=John |date=October 8, 2013 |title=A Janet Yellen Question: Just How Dovish Is She? |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-janet-yellen-question-just-how-dovish-is-she |url-status=live |work=The New Yorker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413041903/https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-janet-yellen-question-just-how-dovish-is-she |archive-date=April 13, 2016 |access-date=October 9, 2013}}</ref><ref name=VastPolicyPortfolio>{{cite news |first1=Alan |last1=Rappeport |first2=Ana |last2=Swanson |first3=Jim |last3=Tankersley |first4=Jeanna |last4=Smialek |author-link1=Alan Rappeport |date=November 24, 2020 |title=Yellen Would Assume Vast Policy Portfolio as Treasury Secretary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/us/politics/janet-yellen-treasury-biden.html |url-status=live |work=The New York Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416221950/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/us/politics/janet-yellen-treasury-biden.html |archive-date=April 16, 2021 |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> However, on [[fiscal policy]], publications often referred to her as "somewhat" of a [[deficit hawk]].<ref name=VastPolicyPortfolio /><ref>{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Claire |date=January 7, 2021 |title=What Yellen's career tells us her views on fiscal policy |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d35b0693-4bd3-4f6f-ae09-cf7603d21cda |url-status=live |work=Financial Times |archive-url=https://archive.today/xSztp |archive-date=January 7, 2021 |access-date=January 8, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jordan |last=Weissmann |date=May 6, 2021 |title=Joe Biden Is Starting to Sound Hawkish About the Deficit.

Yellen is a [[Keynesian]] economist and has been described as a "Keynesian to her fingertips"; during the [[Great Recession]], she "warned against an over-hasty removal of stimulus"; "insisted that the Fed pay as much attention to unemployment as to inflation"; and "believes the state has a duty to tackle poverty and inequality".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cassidy |first=John |date=April 3, 2013 |title=Janet Yellen: A Keynesian Woman at the Fed |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-a-keynesian-woman-at-the-fed |url-status=live |work=The New Yorker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014063610/https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/janet-yellen-a-keynesian-woman-at-the-fed |archive-date=October 14, 2014 |access-date=April 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=JobsSlump/> When her appointment as Treasury secretary was announced in December 2020, Yellen was viewed by Wall Street "as a Treasury secretary who will push hard for expansionary policies aimed at boosting growth, profits and share prices", although the ability of Yellen to push through her preferred fiscal policies was seen as likely to be constrained by congressional [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlock]].<ref name=JobsSlump/>

== Personal life ==
Yellen is married to [[George Akerlof]], an economist, 2001 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] laureate, professor at the [[McCourt School of Public Policy]] at [[Georgetown University]], and professor emeritus at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="jweekly.com">{{cite news |last=Eskenazi |first=Joe |date=October 12, 2001 |title=U.C.

Robert Akerlof, an economist by training himself, earning an AB degree in economics and mathematics, summa cum laude with special distinction, from [[Yale University]] in 2003 and received a PhD in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 2009, where he was a presidential scholar.<ref name="R.AkerlofCV">{{cite web |url=http://www.robertakerlof.com/download/-akerlof-cv-october-2018-v2.pdf |title=Robert Akerlof Resume |work=robertakerlof.com |access-date=March 13, 2021 |archive-date=April 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413060600/http://www.robertakerlof.com/download/-akerlof-cv-october-2018-v2.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> He works as an associate professor of economics at the [[University of Warwick]].<ref  name="R.AkerlofCV" /> Yellen and Akerlof have often collaborated on research, including topics such as poverty, unemployment and a paper on the costs of out-of-wedlock childbearing.<ref name="FedLove" /> One of their most talked-about papers at Berkeley, on why lower wages do not always lead to higher employment, came from the personal experience of hiring a nanny for the first time. Yellen says Akerlof (along with, as she cited "lifelong mentors," [[James Tobin]] and [[William Brainard]]) has been her biggest intellectual influence.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--> |title=Graduate School Alumna Janet Yellen Takes Charge of the Federal Reserve |url=https://gsas.yale.edu/news/graduate-school-alumna-janet-yellen-takes-charge-federal-reserve |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802000946/https://gsas.yale.edu/news/graduate-school-alumna-janet-yellen-takes-charge-federal-reserve |archive-date=August 2, 2015 |website=Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences |date=February 3, 2014 |access-date=February 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Foroohar Time">{{Cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=January 9, 2014 |title=Janet Yellen: The Sixteen Trillion Dollar Woman |url=https://time.com/4238/janet-yellen-the-sixteen-trillion-dollar-woman/ |url-status=live |work=Time |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210429044140/https://time.com/4238/janet-yellen-the-sixteen-trillion-dollar-woman/ |archive-date=April 29, 2021 |access-date=January 10, 2014 |quote=“Firms are not always willing to cut wages, even if there are people lined up outside the gates to work.

The couple’s conclusion: some employers set pay higher to demonstrate that they value employees in a way that motivates them to do good work, even when markets are ready to undercut those wages. As any parent paying more than market rates for a nanny knows, child care is a labor market in which the conventional wisdom doesn’t always hold.}}</ref> Both frequently state that their lone disagreement is that she is a bit more supportive of free trade than he is.<ref name="NobelPrize">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2001/akerlof/biographical/ |title=George A.
