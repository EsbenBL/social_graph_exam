'''Wilhelm Dilthey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|l|t|aɪ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈdɪltaɪ|lang}};<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krech|first1=Eva-Maria|last2=Stock|first2=Eberhard|last3=Hirschfeld|first3=Ursula|last4=Anders|first4=Lutz Christian|title=Deutsches Aussprachewörterbuch|trans-title=German Pronunciation Dictionary|language=German|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-11-018202-6|pages=446, 1055}}</ref> 19 November 1833 – 1 October 1911) was a German [[historian]], [[psychologist]], [[sociologist]], and [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic philosopher]], who held [[G. W. F. Hegel]]'s Chair in Philosophy at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].  As a polymathic philosopher, working in a modern research university, Dilthey's research interests revolved around questions of [[scientific methodology]], historical evidence and history's status as a science.  He could be considered an [[empiricist]],<ref>Hans Peter Rickman, ''Wilhelm Dilthey, Pioneer of the Human Studies'', University of California Press, 1979, p. 53.</ref> in contrast to the [[idealism]] prevalent in Germany at the time, but his account of what constitutes the empirical and experiential differs from [[British empiricism]] and [[positivism]] in its central [[epistemological]] and [[ontological]] assumptions, which are drawn from German [[German literature|literary]] and [[German philosophy|philosophical]] traditions.

==Life==
Dilthey was born in 1833 as the son of a [[Calvinism|Reformed]] pastor in the village of [[Biebrich (Wiesbaden)|Biebrich]] in the [[Duchy of Nassau]], now in [[Hesse]], Germany.  As a young man he followed family traditions by studying [[theology]] at [[Heidelberg University]], where his teachers included the young [[Kuno Fischer]].  He then moved to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and was taught by, amongst others, [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]] and [[August Boeckh]], both former pupils of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]].  In January 1864,<ref name="ID">Iris Därmann, ''Fremde Monde der Vernunft: die ethnologische Provokation der Philosophie'', Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 2005, p. 285.</ref> he received his doctorate from Berlin with a thesis in Latin on Schleiermacher's ethics, and in June of the same year<ref name="ID"/> he also earned his [[habilitation]] with a thesis on [[moral consciousness]].  He became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at Berlin in 1865.

In 1859, he edited Schleiermacher's letters and soon after he was also commissioned to write a biography—the first volume of which was eventually published in 1870. In 1867 he took up a professorship at the [[University of Basel]], but later—in 1882—he returned to Berlin where he held the prestigious chair in philosophy at the University.

In 1874, he married Katherine Puttmann, and the couple had one son and two daughters.

He died in 1911.<ref name="SEP">Makkreel, Rudolf, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/dilthey/ "Wilhelm Dilthey"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).</ref>

==Work==

===Hermeneutics===
Dilthey took some of his inspiration from the works of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] on [[hermeneutics]], which he helped revive. Both figures are linked to [[German Romanticism]].<ref>Ramberg, Bjørn and Gjesdal, Kristin, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/ "Hermeneutics," ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], Edward N. Zalta (ed.)</ref> Schleiermacher was strongly influenced by German Romanticism which led him to place more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Dilthey, in his turn, as the author of a vast monograph on Schleiermacher, responds to the questions raised by [[Johann Gustav Droysen|Droysen]] and [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]] about the philosophical legitimation of the human sciences. He argues that 'scientific explanation of nature' (''erklären'') must be completed with a theory of how the world is given to human beings through symbolically mediated practices. To provide such a theory is the aim of the philosophy of the [[humanities]]—a field of study to which Dilthey dedicated his entire academic career.

The school of Romantic hermeneutics stressed that historically embedded interpreters—a "living" rather than a [[Cartesian dualism]] or "theoretical" subject—use 'understanding' and 'interpretation' (''Verstehen''), which combine individual-psychological and social-historical description and analysis, to gain a greater knowledge of texts and authors in their contexts.  However, Dilthey remains distinct from other German Romantics and life philosophers through his emphasis on “historicality.”  Dilthey understood man as a historical being.  However, history is not described in terms of an object of the past, but “a series of world views.”<ref name="Palmer, Richard 1969 p. 117">Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 117.</ref>  Man cannot understand himself through reflection or introspection, but only through what “history can tell him…never in objective concepts but always only in the living experience which springs up out of the depths of his own being.”<ref name="Palmer, Richard 1969 p. 117"/>  Dilthey wants to emphasize the “intrinsic temporality of all understanding,” that man's understanding is dependent on past worldviews, interpretations, and a shared world.<ref>Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. pp. 117–118.</ref>

The process of interpretive inquiry established by Schleiermacher involved what Dilthey called the [[hermeneutic circle]]—the recurring movement between the implicit and the explicit, the particular and the whole. Schleiermacher saw the approaches to interpreting sacred scriptures (for example, the Pauline epistles) and Classical texts (e.g. [[Plato]]'s philosophy) as more specific forms of what he proposed as "general hermeneutics" (''allgemeine Hermeneutik''). Schleiermacher approached hermeneutics as the “art of understanding” and recognized both the importance of language, and the thoughts of an author, to interpreting a text.<ref>Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. “The Hermeneutics: Outline of the 1819 Lectures,” ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 1–2.</ref>

Dilthey saw understanding as the key for the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en'') in contrast with the natural sciences.  The natural sciences observe and explain nature, but the humanities understand human expressions of life.<ref>Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 105.</ref>  So long as a science is “accessible to us through a procedure based on the systematic relation between life, expression, and understanding” Dilthey considered it a part of the human sciences.<ref>Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 107.</ref><ref>http://www4.westminster.edu/staff/nak/courses/documents/Dilthey_Other_Persons.pdf</ref>

Along with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Henri Bergson]], Dilthey's work influenced early twentieth-century ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' and ''[[Existentialism|Existenzphilosophie]]''.

Dilthey's students included [[Bernhard Groethuysen]], [[Hans Lipps]], [[Herman Nohl]], [[Theodor Litt]], [[Eduard Spranger]], [[Georg Misch]] and [[Erich Rothacker]]. Dilthey's philosophy also influenced the religious philosopher [[Martin Buber]].<ref>[http://www.dibb.de/buber-martin-religionswisenschaft.php Martin Buber] at http://dibb.de.</ref><ref>"[http://www.iep.utm.edu/buber/ Martin Buber (1878—1965)]." ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved 20 October 2015.</ref>

Dilthey's works informed the early [[Martin Heidegger]]'s approach to hermeneutics in his early lecture courses, in which he developed a "hermeneutics of factical life," and in ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Scharff |first=Robert C. |date=January 1997 |title=Heidegger's "Appropriation" of Dilthey before Being and Time. |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/225780/pdf |journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=105–128 |doi= 10.1353/hph.1997.0021 |access-date=19 September 2020 |publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press |s2cid=96473379 |quote= In a word, I think the record shows that the Dilthey appropriation taught the young Heidegger <i>how to philosophize</i>. [127]}}</ref> But Heidegger grew increasingly critical of Dilthey, arguing for a more radical "temporalization" of the possibilities of interpretation and human existence.

In ''Wahrheit und Methode'' (''[[Truth and Method]]'', 1960), [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], influenced by Heidegger, criticised Dilthey's approach to hermeneutics as both overly aesthetic and subjective as well as method-oriented and "positivistic." According to Gadamer, Dilthey's hermeneutics is insufficiently concerned with the ontological event of truth and inadequately considers the implications of how the interpreter and the interpreter's interpretations are not outside of tradition but occupy a particular position within it, i.e., have a temporal horizon.

===Psychology<!--'Explanatory psychology', 'Explanative psychology', 'Descriptive psychology (Dilthey)', 'Analytic psychology (Dilthey)', and 'Structural psychology (Dilthey)' redirect here-->===
Dilthey was interested in psychology. In his work ''Ideas Concerning a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology'' (''Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie'', 1894),<ref>[http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/spdk/dilthey/wd-bezepsy1.html Full text online on gleichsatz.de].</ref> he introduced a distinction between '''explanatory psychology'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (''erklärende Psychologie''; also '''explanative psychology'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->) and '''descriptive psychology'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (''beschreibende Psychologie''; also '''analytic psychology'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, ''zergliedernde Psychologie''): in his terminology, explanatory psychology is the study of psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view, which involves their subordination to a system of causality, while descriptive psychology is a discipline that attempts to explicate how different mental processes converge in the "structural nexus of [[consciousness]]."<ref name="SEP"/>

The distinction is based on the more general distinction between explanatory/explanative sciences (''erklärende Wissenschaften''), on the one hand, and interpretive sciences (''beschreibende Wissenschaften'' or ''verstehende Wissenschaften'', that is, the sciences which are based on the ''[[Verstehen]]'' method), on the other—see [[#Distinction between natural sciences and human sciences|below]].

In his later work (''Der Aufbau der geschichtlichen Welt in den Geisteswissenschaften'', 1910), he used the alternative term '''structural psychology'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (''Strukturpsychologie'') for descriptive psychology.<ref>W. Dilthey, ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', Princeton University Press, 2002, pp. 16–7 and 38–9; Rudolf A. Makkreel, ''Dilthey: Philosopher of the Human Studies'', Princeton University Press, 1992, p. 290.</ref>

===Sociology===
Dilthey was also interested in what some would call [[sociology]] in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. He objected to their [[dialectic]]al/[[evolution]]ist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, as well as their narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of [[positivism]] was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did however have good things to say about the [[neo-Kantian]] sociology of [[Georg Simmel]], with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin.<ref>See Addenda to Vol. I of the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' in Dilthey, ''Introduction to the Human Sciences''  trans. Ramon J. Betanoz, 'Appendix: Supplementary Material from the Manuscripts', 1988, pp. 3314–.</ref> Simmel himself was later an associate of [[Max Weber]], the primary founder of sociological [[antipositivism]]. J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of [[antipositivism|nonpositivist ''verstehende'' sociology]] and the ''[[Verstehen]]'' method.

===Distinction between natural sciences and human sciences<!--linked from the 'Psychology' section-->===
A lifelong concern was to establish a proper theoretical and methodological foundation for the "human sciences" (e.g. history, law, literary criticism), distinct from, but equally "scientific" as, the "natural sciences" (e.g. physics, chemistry). He suggested that all human experience divides naturally into two parts: that of the surrounding natural world, in which "objective necessity" rules, and that of inner experience, characterized by "sovereignty of the will, responsibility for actions, a capacity to subject everything to thinking and to resist everything within the fortress of freedom of his/her own person".<ref name=Einleitung>W. Dilthey, ''Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften'', 1972, p. 6.</ref>

Dilthey strongly rejected using a model formed exclusively from the [[natural sciences]] (''Naturwissenschaften''), and instead proposed developing a separate model for the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en''). His argument centered around the idea that in the natural sciences we seek to explain phenomena in terms of cause and effect, or the general and the particular; in contrast, in the human sciences, we seek to ''understand'' (''verstehen'') in terms of the relations of the part and the whole. In the social sciences we may also combine the two approaches, a point stressed by German sociologist [[Max Weber]]. His principles, a general theory of understanding or comprehension (''[[Verstehen]]'') could, he asserted, be applied to all manner of interpretation ranging from ancient texts to art work, religious works, and even law. His interpretation of different theories of [[aesthetics]] in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was preliminary to his speculations concerning the form aesthetic theory would take in the twentieth century.

Both the natural and human sciences originate in the context or "nexus" of life (''Lebenszusammenhang''), a concept which influenced the phenomenological account of the [[lifeworld]] (''Lebenswelt''), but are differentiated in how they relate to their life-context. Whereas the natural sciences abstract away from it, it becomes the primary object of inquiry in the human sciences.<ref>Jacob Owensby, "Dilthey's Conception of the Life-Nexus", ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', 25 (4) (1987) pp. 557-572.</ref>

Dilthey defended his use of the term ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' (literally, "science of the mind" or "spiritual knowledge") by pointing out that other terms such as "social science" and "cultural sciences" are equally one-sided and that the human mind or spirit is the central phenomenon from which all others are derived and analyzable.<ref name=Einleitung/> For Dilthey, like Hegel, ''Geist'' ("mind" or "spirit") has a cultural rather than a social meaning. It is not an abstract intellectual principle or disembodied behavioral experience but refers to the individual's life in its concrete cultural-historical context.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Weltanschauungen===
In 1911, Dilthey developed a typology of the three basic ''[[Weltanschauung]]en'', or World-Views, which he considered to be "typical" (comparable to Max Weber's notion of "ideal types") and conflicting ways of conceiving of humanity's relation to [[Nature]].<ref>W. Dilthey, ''Die Typen der Weltanschauung und ihre Ausbildung in den Metaphysischen Systemen'', Berlin: Reichl, 1911.</ref>
* in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]], represented by [[Epicurean]]s of all times and places, humans see themselves as determined by nature
* in the Idealism of Freedom (or [[Subjective Idealism]]), represented by [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], humans are conscious of their separation from nature by their free will
* in [[Objective Idealism]], represented by [[G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Giordano Bruno]], humans are conscious of their harmony with nature.
This approach influenced [[Karl Jaspers]]' ''Psychology of Worldviews'' as well as [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s  ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]''.

===Comparison with the Neo-Kantians===
Dilthey's ideas should be examined in terms of his similarities and differences with [[Wilhelm Windelband]] and [[Heinrich Rickert]], members of the [[Baden School]] of [[Neo-Kantianism]]. Dilthey was not a Neo-Kantian, but had a profound knowledge of Immanuel Kant's philosophy, which deeply influenced his thinking. But whereas Neo-Kantianism was primarily interested in epistemology on the basis of Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Dilthey took Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' as his point of departure. An important debate between Dilthey and the Neo-Kantians concerned the "human" as opposed to "cultural" sciences, with the Neo-Kantians arguing for the exclusion of psychology from the cultural sciences and Dilthey for its inclusion as a human science.

==Editorial work==
In 1859, Dilthey was asked to complete the editing of Schleiermacher's letters.<ref name="SEP"/>

Dilthey also inaugurated the Academy edition (the ''Akademie-Ausgabe'' abbreviated as ''AA'' or ''Ak'') of Kant's writings (''Gesammelte Schriften'', [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften]], Berlin, 1902–38) in 1895,<ref>Immanuel Kant, ''Notes and Fragments'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. xvi.</ref> and served as its first editor. 

In 1906 he published ''Die Jugendgeschichte Hegels'' on the earlier Hegel's political and theological thought.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Dilthey|url=https://archive.org/details/diejugendgeschic0004dilt/mode/2up|title=Die Jugendgeschichte Hegels und andere Abhandlungen zur Geschichte des deutschen Idealismus|language=German|website=Internet Archive|year=1963|via=[https://digi20.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00044670_00002.html digitale-sammlungen.de]|publisher=B.
