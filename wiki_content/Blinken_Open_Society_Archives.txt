'''Blinken Open Society Archives''' (abbreviated as '''Blinken OSA''') is an archival repository and laboratory that aims to explore new ways of assessing, contextualizing, presenting, and making use of archival documents both in a professional and a consciously activist way.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osaarchivum.org/about-us|title=About Us|access-date=2021-05-12|website=Open Society Archives}}</ref> It was founded by [[George Soros]] in 1995, and opened in 1996 as a department of the at the [[Central European University]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Open Society Archives|last=Mink|first=András|publisher=[[Open Society Archives]] at [[Central European University]]|year=1999|isbn=963 85230 5 0|location=Budapest|pages=30-31|editor1-last=Pudlowski|editor1-first=Leszek|editor2-last=Székely|editor2-first=Iván|chapter=The Open Society Archives: a brief history}}</ref> Originally called simply Open Society Archives (OSA), in 2015 it was renamed '''Vera and Donald Blinken Open Society Archives''' after receiving a major donation from the couple.<ref>{{Cite web|date=12 November 2015|title=OSA was renamed Vera and Donald Blinken Open Society Archives|url=https://www.osaarchivum.org/press-room/announcements/OSA-was-renamed-Vera-and-Donald-Blinken-Open-Society-Archives|url-status=live|access-date=21 May 2021|website=[[Open Society Archives]]}}</ref>

Its archival holdings relate to post-war European history, the [[Cold War]], the history of the former [[Eastern Bloc]], [[samizdat]], the history of [[propaganda]], [[human rights]], and [[war crimes]]. Blinken OSA is also the archive of the global activities of the [[Open Society Foundations]].

Blinken OSA also functions as a teaching and research department of the [[Central European University]] and offers MA and PhD courses on the theories and methods of archives, evidence, human rights, documentary cinema, twentieth century history, and the politics of the Cold War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/teaching/our-courses|title=Our Courses - OSA Archivum|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>

The institution is located in central [[Budapest]], in the [[Goldberger House]], which was originally built in 1911 as a textile warehouse, and later functioned in the 1980s as the “dollar shop” in Budapest, where goods could only be purchased with hard currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/about-us/goldberger-house|title=Goldberger House - OSA Archivum|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>

The building now also incorporates a gallery space, Galeria Centralis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/galeria-centralis|title=Galeria Centralis - OSA Archivum|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> which hosts Blinken OSA's public programs, exhibitions and conferences.

==Holdings==

[[File:OSA Polish samizdat stamps.jpg|thumb|Stamps produced by the Polish underground in the early 1980s, held at OSA Archivum Budapest]]

The archive curates, preserves and makes accessible multilingual collections in over 40 languages spanning the period from World War II until the present, with a global geographical coverage but special focus on [[East-Central Europe]] and the former [[Soviet Union]].

Blinken OSA’s acquisition policy aims to collect and preserve the documentary heritage of civil society, human rights movements, transnational and intra-governmental organizations, social and protest movements, and the personal papers of known oppositional figures and social activists. From its inception, Blinken OSA has assisted in rescuing endangered collections, and plays a bridging role in making scattered documentary legacies of communities and supranational organizations researchable. By introducing open access principles in the region since 2002, Blinken OSA continues to support and initiate projects about freedom of information, freedom of speech, access to information and open standards.

===Cold War===

The original core of Blinken OSA’s holdings is the former archives of the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] Research Institute, previously based in Munich and New York. These include RFE internal research publications produced to support the national broadcasting desks, transcripts of central broadcasts from RFE/RL’s target countries,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osaarchivum.org/digital-repository/osa:484d852e-1334-4570-a2be-e41230b9e36a|title=Radio Free Europe Information Items|access-date=2021-05-12|website=[[Open Society Archives]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osaarchivum.org/digital-repository/osa:6f4d954a-481d-4e85-af9c-5af1cebee9a9|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Background Reports|access-date=2021-05-12|website=[[Open Society Archives]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osaarchivum.org/digital-repository/osa:f80cb1e2-fb79-4068-af0f-80c7a39465cb|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Situation Reports|access-date=2021-05-12|website=[[Open Society Archives]]}}</ref> anonymized interviews with eastern European émigrés and travellers, almost all daily papers and magazines published in or about Eastern Europe between 1951 and 1993, records and transcripts of Eastern European radio and television programs and other supporting materials used for daily broadcasts.

Using traditional archival research and contemporary mapping and crowd-sourcing technologies, the project marked the 70th anniversary of the Holocaust in Hungary, and aimed to involve the contemporary residents of the city in exploring this lesser-known chapter of Budapest's history.

Blinken OSA is one of the initiators of the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]], one of the original signatories of the [[Open Document Format Alliance]],<ref>http://www.odfalliance.hu/hu/index{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the founder of the Parallel Archive,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parallelarchive.org|title=Parallel Archive|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> a digital humanities tool where researchers are encouraged to digitize, tag, comment, and make publicly available the documents they find in Blinken OSA’s holdings. In 2010, Blinken OSA ‘leaked’ thousands of previously classified documents from its holdings relating to the Cold War conflict on the Parallel Archive.<ref>[http://index.hu/belfold/2010/12/28/osaleaks/ András Iván, 'Gondolatolvasókkal fürkészték volna a szovjeteket', ''Index'', December 28, 2011 (link in Hungarian)]</ref>

Together with the International Visegrad Fund, Blinken OSA also awards a number of research scholarships every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/work-with-us/fellowship/visegrad-scholarship|title=Visegrad Scholarship at the Open Society Archives - OSA Archivum|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>
