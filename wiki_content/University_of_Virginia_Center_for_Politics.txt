The '''University of Virginia Center for Politics''' was founded in 1998 by professor and political analyst [[Larry Sabato]] to put into practice his belief that "Politics is a good thing!" The Center for Politics is a [[nonpartisan]] organization based in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], which seeks to increase civic knowledge and involvement among all citizens. The Center for Politics is part of the [[University of Virginia]] and draws its funding from a variety of public and private sources. It has its own dedicated staff and building, operating out of historic Montesano, on property once owned by U.S. Senator [[Thomas S. Martin]].

The Center for Politics's main focus is [[civic education]] and engagement, exemplified by its flagship program, the Youth Leadership Initiative. The Youth Leadership Initiative provides a free technology-based curriculum of [[civics]] materials to [[K-12 schools]] across the country and around the world, and conducts the largest all-student [[mock election]] in the nation each November.

The Center for Politics also publishes ''[[Sabato's Crystal Ball]]'', a source of comprehensive election analysis which has been recognized as providing the most accurate electoral predictions in the country on its website and through a free weekly e-mail.

Additionally, the Center for Politics organizes conferences and programs, publishes books and reports, and supports and promotes college student [[civic education]] through [[internships]], [[voter registration]] drives, and on-campus speakers.

== Mission ==
The Center for Politics was founded to "promote the value of politics and the importance of [[civic engagement]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/about.html|title=Center for Politics, University of Virginia|work=centerforpolitics.org|access-date=11 August 2015}}</ref> By improving the political process and citizens' interaction with it, the Center for Politics strives to improve the functioning of government itself. In addition, the mission includes three goals:

* Encourage citizens to actively participate in the political process and government
* Evaluate and promote the [[best practices]] in [[civic education]] for students of all ages
* Educate citizens through the Center for Politics' comprehensive research, programs, and publications

== History ==

The Center for Politics was founded in 1998 by Robert Kent Gooch Professor of Politics and noted [[political analyst]] Larry Sabato, who is known as "the most quoted professor in all the land."<ref name="Hook">{{cite news

</ref> Its first programs that year were the Virginia Governors' Conference, which evolved into the Virginia Political History Project, and a post-election [[Academic conference|conference]] which is now the annual American Democracy Conference.

The Youth Leadership Initiative (which provides civic education resources and tools for grades [[K-12]]) launched in 1999, as did the National Symposium Series, and the Crystal Ball's election predictions debuted in 2002.

In 2008, the Center for Politics moved into its new home at Montesano, an early 20th-century [[Georgian Revival]] house on land previously owned by [[Thomas Staples Martin]], [[US Senator]] from [[Virginia]].  In 2009, the Center for Politics launched its newest program, Global Perspectives on Democracy, a program designed to foster dialogue between citizens in established and emerging democracies around the world, and conduct workshops on civic action plans.

== Youth Leadership Initiative ==
The Youth Leadership Initiative provides free, technology-based civic education materials to [[K-12]] teachers and students in public and private schools in all 50 states and Defense Department schools internationally.

The program emphasizes hands-on participation so that students can directly experience the electoral and legislative procedures of American government. The components of the Youth Leadership Initiative include detailed [[lesson plan]]s, an online [[mock election]], an online policy-making simulation which engages students in the law-making process nationwide, and a political campaign-simulating computer game.<ref name="YLI">{{cite web|url=http://www.youthleadership.net|title=Youth Leadership Initiative|work=youthleadership.net|access-date=11 August 2015}}</ref>

In 2008, Diane Trim of Inside the School, a website for secondary educators, ranked the Youth Leadership Initiative's [[mock election]] highly, giving it more stars than the other two educational mock election programs reviewed and praising the Youth Leadership Initiative program for its comprehensiveness and ease of use.<ref>[http://www.insidetheschool.com/articles/lesson-planning/election-2008-online-student-voting-site-reviews/ Inside the School Mock Election Reviews]</ref>

The Youth Leadership Initiative began as a response to a perception of increasing [[political apathy]] among citizens and a decline in the number of schools incorporating civics lessons into their curricula. It started in Virginia [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], but is now nationwide.
