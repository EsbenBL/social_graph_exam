He is held as one of the most influential Iranian intellectuals of the 20th century<ref>Gheissari, Ali. 1998. ''Iranian Intellectuals in the Twentieth Century''.

==Biography==
Ali Shariati (Ali Masharati) was born in 1933 in [[Mazinan]], a suburb of [[Sabzevar]], in northeastern [[Imperial State of Persia|Iran]].<ref>[[Ali Rahnema|Rahnema, Ali]]. 1998, 2000.

Tauris, p. 35.</ref> His father's family were clerics.<ref name=rakel8>{{cite book|last=Rakel|first=E.P.|title=The Iranian Political Elite, State and Society Relations, and Foreign Relations since the Islamic Revolution|year=2008|publisher=University of Amsterdam|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/104471}}</ref> His father, Mohammad-Taqi, was a teacher and Islamic scholar. In 1947, he opened the Centre for the Propagation of Islamic Truths in [[Mashhad]], in [[Khorasan Province]].<ref>''An Islamic Utopian'', p. 13.</ref> It was a social Islamic forum which became embroiled in the oil nationalisation movement of the 1950s.<ref>''An Islamic Utopian'', pp. 13–18.</ref> Shariati's mother was from a small land-owning family.<ref name=rakel8/> His mother was from Sabzevar, a little town near Mashhad.<ref name="Ervand Abrahamian 1989 105">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCVsR1cJc7oC&q=+shariati|title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin|author=Ervand Abrahamian|year=1989|page=105|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=1850430772}}</ref>

In his years at the Teacher's Training College in [[Mashhad]], Shariati came into contact with young people who were from less privileged economic classes of society, and for the first time saw the poverty and hardship that existed in Iran during that period. At the same time, he was exposed to many aspects of [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical]] and political thought. He attempted to explain and offer solutions for the problems faced by Muslim societies through traditional Islamic principles interwoven with, and understood from, the point of view of modern sociology and philosophy. His articles from this period for the Mashhad daily newspaper, ''Khorasan'', display his developing eclecticism and acquaintance with the ideas of modernist thinkers such as [[Jamal-al-Din Afghani|Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]], [[Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal]] of Pakistan, among Muslims, and [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alexis Carrel]].<ref>''An Islamic Utopian'', pp. 61–68.</ref>

In 1952, he became a high-school teacher and founded the Islamic Students' Association, which led to his arrest following a demonstration. In 1953, the year of [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|Mossadeq's overthrow]], he became a member of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]]. He received his bachelor's degree from the [[University of Mashhad]] in 1955. In 1957, he was arrested again by the Iranian police, along with sixteen other members of the National Resistance Movement.

Shariati then managed to get a scholarship for France, where he continued his graduate studies at [[University of Paris]]. He left Paris after earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in sociology in 1964. During this period in Paris, Shariati started collaborating with the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] (FLN) in 1959. The following year, he began to read [[Frantz Fanon]] and translated an anthology of his work into Persian.<ref>[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/monde/dossier/islamisme/dossier.asp?ida=436714 «La jeune génération est un enjeu»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205192933/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/monde/dossier/islamisme/dossier.asp?ida=436714 |date=5 December 2006 }}, interview with [[Gilles Kepel]] in ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 26 January 2006 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Shariati introduced Fanon's thought into Iranian revolutionary émigrée circles. He was arrested in Paris on 17 January 1961 during a demonstration in honour of [[Patrice Lumumba]].

The same year he joined [[Ebrahim Yazdi]], [[Mostafa Chamran]] and [[Sadegh Qotbzadeh]] in founding the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] abroad. In 1962, he continued studying sociology and the [[history of religion]]s in Paris, and followed the courses of Islamic scholar [[Louis Massignon]], [[Jacques Berque]] and the sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]]. He also came to know the philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] that same year, and published [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad]]'s book ''[[Gharbzadegi]]'' (or ''Occidentosis'') in Iran.

Shariati then returned to [[Iran]] in 1964, where he was arrested and imprisoned for engaging in subversive political activities while in France. He was released after a few weeks, at which point he began teaching at the University of Mashhad.

Shariati next went to [[Tehran]], where he began lecturing at the [[Hosseiniye Ershad]] Institute. These lectures were hugely popular among his students, and were spread by word of mouth throughout all economic sectors of society, including the middle and upper classes, where interest in his teachings began to grow immensely.

His continued success again aroused the interest of the government, which arrested him, along with many of his students. Widespread pressure from the people, and an international outcry, eventually led to his release on 20 March 1975, after eighteen months in solitary confinement.

Shariati was allowed to leave for [[England]]. He died three weeks later in a [[Southampton]] hospital under "mysterious circumstances", although in [[Ali Rahnema]]'s biography of Shariati, he is said to have died of a fatal heart attack. He is buried next to [[Zaynab bint Ali|Sayyidah Zaynab]], the granddaughter of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], and the daughter of [[Ali]], in [[Damascus]], where Iranian pilgrims often visit.

===Views and popularity===

[[File:Shariati7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Ali Shariati''' and his family, one day after his release from prison.]]

Shariati sought to revive the revolutionary currents of [[Shia Islam|Shiism]].<ref name=ostovar>{{cite web|last=Ostovar|first=Afshon P.|title=Guardians of the Islamic Revolution: Ideology, Politics, and the Development of Military Power in Iran (1979–2009)|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/64683/afshon_1.pdf;jsessionid=DF7BFA33BF18FF73E9117CB0504F14E1?sequence=1|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=26 July 2013|format=PhD Dissertation|date=2009}}</ref> His interpretation of Shiism encouraged revolution in the world, and promised salvation after death.<ref name=milani>{{cite book|author=Abbas Milani|title=The Myth of the Great Satan: A New Look at America's Relations with Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTrRom48fhAC&pg=PA123|year=2010|publisher=Hoover Press|isbn=978-0-8179-1136-2|page=122}}</ref> He referred to his brand of Shiism as [[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism|"red Shiism"]] which he contrasted with non-revolutionary [[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism|"black Shiism"]] or [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid Shiism]].<ref>Ali Shariati, "[[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism]]".</ref> His ideas have been compared to the Catholic [[Liberation Theology]] movement founded in South America by Peruvian [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and Brazilian [[Leonardo Boff]].<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 129</ref>

Shariati was a prominent Islamist [[philosopher]], who argued that a good society would conform to Islamic values. He suggested that the role of government was to guide society in the best possible manner rather than manage it in the best possible way.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evSkdzXF_4</ref> He believed that the most learned members of the [[Ulema]] (clergy) should play a leadership role in guiding society, because they best understand how to administer an Islamic value system based on the teachings of the Prophets of God and the 12 Shia [[Twelver]] Imams.<ref name="youtube.com">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RjiWLcuyQA</ref> He argued that the role of the clergy was to guide society in accordance with Islamic values to advance human beings towards reaching their highest potential—not to provide/serve the hedonistic desires of individuals as in the West.<ref name="youtube.com"/>

At the same time, Shariati was very critical of some clerics and defended the [[Marxists]]. "Our mosques, the revolutionary left and our preachers," he declared, "work for the benefit of the deprived people and against the lavish and lush... Our clerics who teach jurisprudence and issue ''[[fatwa]]s'' are right-wingers, capitalist, and conservative; simply our ''fiqh'' is at the service of capitalism."<ref>{{Cite book|title= ''Jahatgiri-ye Tabaqati-e Islam'' [Class bias of Islam], in ''Collected Works'', 10|author=Ali Shariati|location=Tehran|pages=37–38|year=1980}}</ref>

Shariati's works were highly influenced by the [[Third Worldism]] that he encountered as a student in Paris—ideas that [[class conflict|class war]] and revolution would bring about a just and [[classless society]]—from one side, and the epistemic [[decolonisation]] thinking of his time from the other side. He is said to have adopted the idea of ''[[Gharbzadegi]]'' from [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad]] and given it "its most vibrant and influential second life".<ref>Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', p. 330</ref>

He sought to translate these ideas into cultural symbols of Shiism that Iranians could relate to. Shariati believed Shia should not merely await the return of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|12th Imam]], but should actively work to hasten his return by fighting for [[social justice]], "even to the point of embracing [[martyrdom]]," saying "every day is [[Ashoura]], every place is the [[Battle of Karbala|Karbala]]".<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 128–9</ref>

When he was writing the three letters to Fanon, unlike him, Shariati believed that it is not true that one must put away religion to fight imperialism. He felt that people could fight imperialism solely by recovering their culture identity. In some countries, such an identity was intertwined with fundamental religious beliefs. Shariati refers to the maxim of returning to ourselves.<ref>{{Cite book|title= From Blank Revolution to Islamic Revolution|author=Naser Gharagozlu|page=87|year=2006}}</ref>

Social theorist [[Asef Bayat]] has recorded his observations as a witness and participant in the [[Iranian revolution]] of 1979. He asserts that Shariati emerged at the time of the revolution as "an unparalleled revolutionary intellectual" with his portraits widely present during the marches and protests and his nickname as "mo'allem-e enqilab" (revolutionary mentor) chanted by millions and whose literature and tapes had already been widely available before the revolution. "My father," recalls Bayat, "barely literate, had his own copies" of Shariati's works.<ref name="Bayat">{{Cite book|title=Revolution without Revolutionaries: Making Sense of the Arab Spring|last=Bayat|first=Asef|date=2017|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9781503602588|language=en-US|page=47}}</ref>

===Shariati and socialism===
It seems that his eagerness to explore [[socialism]] began with the translation of the book ''[[Abu Dhar al-Ghifari|Abu Zarr]]: The God-Worshipping Socialist'' by the Egyptian thinker Abdul Hamid Jowdat-al-Sahar ([[:ar:عبد الحميد جودة السحار]]). According to this book, Abu Dhar was the very first socialist.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qh_QotrY7RkC&q=Abu+Zarr%3A+the+socialist+God+worshiper&pg=PA465 |title=Iran Between Two Revolutions |last=Abrahamian |first=Ervand |date=21 July 1982 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=465 |isbn=0691101345 |access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref> Then, Shariarti's father declared that his son believed that the principles of Abu Dhar are fundamental. Even some thinkers described Shariati as the modern day Abu Dhar in Iran.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCVsR1cJc7oC&q=+shariati|title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin|author=Ervand Abrahamian|year=1989|page=106|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=1850430772}}</ref> Of all his thoughts, there is his insistence on the necessity of revolutionary action. Shariati believed that [[Marxism]] could not provide the [[Third World]] with the ideological means for its own liberation. One of his premises was that Islam by nature is a revolutionary ideology. Therefore, Islam could relate to the modern world as an ideology. According to Shariati, the historical and original origin of [[human]] problems was the emergence of private ownership. He believed that in the modern era, the appearance of the machine was the second most fundamental change in the human condition. In fact, private ownership and the emergence of the machine, if considered one of two curves of history, belong to the second period of history. The first period is collective ownership. However, Shariati gave a critique of the historical development of religion and the modern philosophical and ideological movements and their relationship to both private ownership and the emergence of the machine.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite thesis|last=Manouchehri |first= Abbas|title=Ali Shariati and The Islamic Renaissance|type=PhD dissertation |publisher=University of Missouri |year=1988|page=78}}</ref>

====Epistemology====

Shariati developed the idea of the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge in sociology. He believed in the earthly religion and in the social context in which the meaning of society is construed. He also emphasized that he understood religion historically because he was a sociologist. He said he was concerned with the historical and social [[Tawhid]], not with the truth of the Quran or of Muhammad or Ali.<ref>Behrooz Ghamari-Tabrizi, Abdolkarim Soroush, The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics, Edited by John L. Esposito and Emad El-Din Shahin, online pub date: Dec 2013</ref>

==Philosophy of history==
Completely contrary to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and his philosophy of history, Shariati believed that it is not true that the civilized human is less consciousness than modern people  {{clarify|date=April 2017}} but rather there is a difference between them. The civilized man could talk on himself more than universe and the new people are so concerned with reality and universe that there is no place for himself and mysticism and religion{{clarify|date=January 2020}}. Of course he knows the movement of soul in Hegel's philosophy and history in one sense as right.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/16475/%d8%b4%d8%b1%db%8c%d8%b9%d8%aa%db%8c-%d9%88-%d9%81%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%81%d9%87-%d8%aa%d8%a7%d8%b1%db%8c%d8%ae-%d9%87%da%af%d9%84?q=%D9%87%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B7%20%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%AA%DB%8C&score=120.44966&rownumber=1|author=Ahmad Rasekhi|title=Shariati and the hegel's philosophy of history|page=41|year=1198|magazine=Keyhan Farhangi|number=142}}</ref>{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

==Political philosophy==
In the first place, Shariati criticised western [[liberal democracy]]. He pointed out that there is a direct relationship between [[democracy]], [[liberalism]] and the plundering of nations. He believed that liberal democracy is the enemy of humankind. He also referred to the fact that the ruling economic system of liberal democracy is unjust and contrary to the rights of people. He maintained that in such a society, someone who is weak is already subjected to defeat and annihilation. There are basic foundations in Shariati's thoughts and his criticism of liberal democracy. The first foundation is related to the contrast between the religious worldview and the non-religious one. He explained history, society and humanity according to a [[monism|monistic]] worldview. He explained liberalism as something with inequality and discrimination. Freedom and equality based on spirituality were the very basis of pre-modern societies which were devastated in one period of history.

Shariati believed that the government of Imam Ali could be considered the best form of democracy. On this occasion, he tried to interpret the behavior of [[Ali|Imam Ali]] in contrast with his enemy.<ref name="Sayyed Javad Imam Jomeh Zadeh, Hosein Rouhani 2007 59–78">{{cite book|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/299696/%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%b1%d8%b3%db%8c-%d8%aa%d8%b7%d8%a8%db%8c%d9%82%db%8c-%d8%af%d9%85%d9%88%da%a9%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b3%db%8c-%d8%ba%d8%b1%d8%a8%db%8c-%d8%a8%d8%a7-%d8%af%d9%85%d9%88%da%a9%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b3%db%8c-%d9%85%d8%aa%d8%b9%d9%87%d8%af-%d8%af%da%a9%d8%aa%d8%b1-%d8%b9%d9%84%db%8c-%d8%b4%d8%b1%db%8c%d8%b9%d8%aa%db%8c?q=%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%20%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%AA%DB%8C&score=449.0383&rownumber=1|author=Sayyed Javad Imam Jomeh Zadeh, Hosein Rouhani|title=comparative inquiry on western democracy and commitment democracy of Ali Sharity|magazine=Social sciences of Mashhad university|year=2007|pages=59–78}}</ref>{{clarify|date=May 2017}} He called this democracy Commitment democracy. It appears that Shariati did not accept the western definition of [[democracy]] although he had no problem with democracy. According to him, a religious government is the democratic right of [[Muslim]] citizens. He believed that one of the basic problems of western democracy is [[demagogue|demagogy]]. Nowadays the votes of voters direct to special channels with the help of advertising instruments. In such a condition only one who is critically conscious can dispose of distractions and surface-level arguments, and vote effectively for themselves and their communities. He maintains that the western democracy based on gold, cruelty and tricking (Zar, Zour va Tazvir) is an anti-revolutionary regime which is different with ideological Guidance.<ref name="Sayyed Javad Imam Jomeh Zadeh, Hosein Rouhani 2007 59–78"/>{{clarify|date=May 2017}}{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

===Commitment democracy===

For explaining better the commitment democracy, he at first divides between two concepts. One of them is Syasat and the other is politic. Syasat is a philosophy by government that want to have the responsibility of changing and becoming the society not its being and existence. In fact Syasat is a progressive and dynamic thing. The aim of government in the philosophy of Syasat is to change social foundations, institutions and even all the norms of society namely culture, morality and desires etc. in simple word, Syasat want to make exist the people. In contrary, there is no making in politic. In other word politic is follow of having people not making them. Of course Shariati prefers Syasat on politic because the former is more progressive. He considers with making human (Ensan Sazi). In fact his [[utopia]] is constructed with three concepts of Gnosis, [[Equality before the law|equality]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]]. Commitment democracy appeared out of his lecture in Hoseyniyeh Ershad; a famous lecture with the name of [[Ummah and Imamate]]. According to him, Imam is one who want to guide humans not only in political, social and economic dimensions but also in all existential dimensions. He believes that Imam is alive everywhere and every time. In one hand Imamate is not a metaphysical belief but a revolutionary guide philosophy. He added that Imam has to guide people not according to his desire like dictator but to Islamic ideology and authentic values.<ref name="Sayyed Javad Imam Jomeh Zadeh, Hosein Rouhani 2007 59–78"/>{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

==Sociology==
Some scholars classify him among the current of religious neo-thinkers. According to this stand point, Shariati accepted the rationality of the West. Shariati called the theoretical foundation of West as [[civilization]] and called its appearances as ''Tajadod'' [Renewal]. He emphasized accepting [[civilization]] and criticized tajadod. He also believed that civilization has to be considered as something deep. He also highly acknowledged the importance of [[Science|empirical science]] and knowledge. He appreciated the empirical methodology. He also criticized traditionalism for its disregard of scientific methodology. On another hand, he criticized the Modernists because they confuse the Western ideological theories with valid scientific [[epistemology]]. According to Shariati, the knowledge of reason is self-evident. Therefore, he suggested to think of reason as the axiom for understanding the other sources namely the holy book or [[Quran]], [[ḥadīth]] ('tradition'), [[sīra]] (Prophetic biography) and [[ijmāʿ]] (consensus). Shariati also dismissed consensus as a source for understanding [[religion]]. He insisted on the concepts of knowledge and time along with the holy book and tradition, and stressed the important role of methodology and changing of viewpoint.

Shariati, who was the fan of [[Georges Gurvitch]] in his analysis of [[sociology]], believed that there was no special pattern for the analysis of social affairs and historical events. He thought that there was no unity of religion and society, but rather there were many religions and societies. He referred to the active role of the [[scholar]] of human science during investigation and scientific research. He believed that there was a relationship between the values of scholarship and the effects of those values on the conclusions of investigation. He believed that it was not necessary to extend the other conclusions of other Western scholars to our society [which society? Iranian? Muslim?]. However, he given [check translation] to criticize the Western ideological schools such as [[nationalism]], liberalism, Marxism, etc. He maintained that there was conformity and correspondence between the [[Western philosophy]] and Iranian society. According to Shariati, democracy is inconsistent with revolutionary evolution and progress. One of his criticism of Western ideology is its [regardless imitation of those ideologies - check translation]. One of his other criticisms is the denial of spirituality in the Western philosophy. In fact, those ideologies [which ideologies?] attempt to prevent humans from achieving transcendental goals and any [evolutionary movements - check translation].  In this vein, he firmly criticized capitalism, and at the same time, he admired socialism because it would lead humanity to evolution and free it from utilitarianism. However, he firmly criticized [[Karl Marx]]. According to Shariati, Karl Marx's theory on the [[economy]] as the infrastructure and foundation of human and society [has gone strayed - check translation]. Conversely, Sharia places the human, not the economy, as the foundation and origin of society.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fardin Qoreishi|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/70654/%d8%b9%d9%84%db%8c-%d8%b4%d8%b1%db%8c%d8%b9%d8%aa%db%8c-%d9%88-%d8%ba%d8%b1%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%af%db%8c%d8%b4%db%8c-%d8%a7%d8%b2-%d9%85%d9%88%d8%b6%d8%b9-%d9%86%d9%88%da%af%d8%b1%d8%a7%db%8c%db%8c-%d8%af%db%8c%d9%86%db%8c?q=%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%20%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%AA%DB%8C&score=431.22278&rownumber=2|title=Shariati and thinking on west from religious neo reflection|pages=178–179|year=2001|magazine=Nameh Pajouhesh}}</ref>{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

==Modern problems==
According to Shariati, human [[history]] is composed of two stages, the stage of collectivity and the stage of [[Private property|private ownership]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> He explained that the first stage, collectivity, was concerned with social equality and spiritual oneness. But the second stage, which is the current era, could be considered as the domination of the many by one. The second stage began with the emergence of [[Private property|private ownership]]. The various types of private ownership in history have included [[slavery]], [[serfdom]], [[feudalism]], and [[capitalism]] among others.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> According to the concept of [[social ownership]], all material and spiritual resources are accessible to everyone. But monopoly polarised the human community. In fact, according to Shariati, private ownership is the main cause of all modern problems. These problems change men's brotherhood and love to duplicity, deceit, hatred, exploitation, [[Colonization|colonisation]], and [[massacre]]. The polarisation by [[monopoly]] manifested itself in different forms throughout history. For example, in ancient times there were slave economies that transferred to capitalist society in modern times. In other words, machinism, or the dependence on machines, can be considered the latest stage of private ownership. Machinism began in the nineteenth century and human beings have had to confront the many anxieties and problems arousing from it.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Behdad |first1=Sohrab |title=A Disputed Utopia: Islamic Economics in Revolutionary Iran |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |date=October 1994 |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=775–813 |doi=10.1017/S0010417500019435 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe80/cdc9905d57fb4c42d750400fef2639981c8a.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219002015/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe80/cdc9905d57fb4c42d750400fef2639981c8a.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2020-02-19 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|s2cid=32027587 }}</ref>

==Legacy==

There are many adherents and opponents of Shariati's views. It must be noted that the image of Shariati is not such that some revolutionary groups, in early days of Islamic republic of Iran, attributed to him. In fact, Shariati's personality is largely unknown.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} [[Ali Khamenei]] knew Shariati as a pioneer of Islamic teaching according to the requirements of his generation. According to Sayyed [[Ali Khamenei]], Shariati had both positive and negative characteristics. Khamenei believes that it is unfair to consider Shariati as someone who firmly disagreed with the Mullahs. One of the positive sides of Shariati was his ability to explain his thoughts with suitable and simple language for his generation. Shariati was somewhat supportive of Mullahs in [[Iran]].<ref>http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8903290362</ref>{{clarify|date=May 2017}}  Some Scholars like Elizabeth F. Thompson try to envisage some similarities between Shariati and his role in the Islamic revolution in Iran with [[Sayyid Qutb|Sayyed Qutb]]'s role in [[Egypt]]. One similarity is that both of them paved the way for the imminent revolution in Iran and Egypt. Both desired of Islamic cultural dominance. Both were fans of being revolutionary about ruling values and norms. They considered [[Islamism]] a third way between those of America and the Soviet Union. At the same time they were not wholly utopian and they were partly Islamic. {{clarify|date=May 2017}} Of course there are differences between them - Shariati was a leftist while Qutb was a conservative. According to [[Mahmoud Taleghani]], Ali Shariati was a thinker who created a school for revolution. The school guided young people to revolutionary action. Beheshti believes that Shariati's work was fundamental to Islamic revolution.<ref name="Ervand Abrahamian 1989 105"/>

According to Hamid Enayat, Shariati was not only a theorist but also an adherent of Islamic radicalism. Enayat believes that Shariati can be considered the founder of Islamic socialism. Enayat considers him to be one of the most beloved and popular individuals in Islamic radicalism and socialism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamid Enayat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TauRPwAACAAJ&q=hamid+enayat|title=Modern Islamic Political Thought|year=2008|publisher=Acls History E Book Project|isbn=978-1597404600}}</ref>{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

According to Hamid Elgar, Shariati was the number one ideologue of the Islamic revolution.<ref name="Abdollah Vakili 1991 30–37">{{cite book|author=Abdollah Vakili|title=Ali shariati and the mystical tradition of islam|publisher=Institute of Islamic studies, Mc Gill University|year=1991|pages=30–37}}</ref>
