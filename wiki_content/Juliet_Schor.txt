==Academic work==

=== Early thought ===
While obtaining her Ph.D in economics from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], Schor began to explore the relationship between how employers controlled and regulated employees.<ref name=":1" /> Her and her advisor, Sam Bowles, called these variable of conditions “the cost of job loss” which included how long a person can expect to be unemployed and what kind of social welfare benefits they are eligible for as an unemployed individual.<ref name=":1" />

While a professor at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], Schor was interested in another determinant of “the cost of job loss,” which was the number of hours worked by the employee.<ref name=":1" /> By analyzing various data, she found that even though an employee works overtime, they seem to have no money saved at the end. This led to her question “What do workers do with the money they earn and why is it so hard for them to save money” which required the investigation of social pressures on spending and consumer culture.<ref name=":1" />

In an interview discussing her book ''[[Plenitude: The New Economics of True Wealth]]'' she says, "When people work too many hours they tend to feel deprived and they use consumption to reward themselves, whether that be for an expensive vacation, kitchen remodel or a bigger diamond. The downturn has actually opened up space for people to think about different trajectories for their consumption expectations over their lifetimes."<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://capitalinstitute.org/braintrust/juliet-schor/|title=Juliet Schor|website=Capital Institute}}</ref>

In addition, at an early age, Schor strived to make her work accessible to all. In an interview with Peter Shea, she talks about her early intellectual formation, her critique of conventional economics, and her decision to write for an audience that includes the general public as well as her colleagues in the academy.<ref name="ias" />

=== Best-seller books ===

====''The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure'', Basic Books (1992)<ref name=":0" /> ====
{{main|The Overworked American}} By using household survey data on hours of paid work and one’s time use, Schor discovered that average time spent at work increased around 1 month per year between the years of 1969 and 1987. Further, in the book, Schor discusses a model she developed to predict hours of unpaid work in the home.

====''The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don’t Need'' (1999)<ref name=":0" /> ====
{{main|The Overspent American}} In this book, Schor explores the social and cultural processes that drive individuals to unsustainable spending and debt. She analyzes that consumers are spending more than they did in the past. As a result, she observes that saving rates have been on a decline. Schor argues that one of the reasons for this change is the “[[Keeping up with the Joneses|keeping up]]” process of spending which has gradually led to overspending. Schor connects this trend with the work of [[Pierre Bourdieu|Pierre Bordieu]], especially his ideas of [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]].

====''Born to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture'' (2005)<ref name=":0" /> ====
{{main|Born to Buy}} Many companies have targeted marketing products towards children and in turn, have made them into “commercialized children.” Schor looks at how advertising strategies convince kids that products are necessary to their social survival and this is adopted into their mindsets for their future as well. Schor also provides a sort of optimism at the end, advising parents and teachers on how to deal with this problem.

==== ''Plenitude: The New Economics of True Wealth'' (2010)<ref name=":0" /> ====
{{main|Plenitude (book)}} In this work, Schor outlines a roadmap to move beyond consumerism and consumerism's inherent link to ecological decline. She favors a well-balanced approach to living, considering such elements as nature, community, intelligence, and time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Plenitude|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/best_book/8311552-plenitude-the-new-economics-of-true-wealth|access-date=2020-09-29|website=www.goodreads.com}}</ref> Schor narrated a short film on the economic organization discussed in her book for an animation by Films for Action.<ref>{{Citation|title=Visualizing a Plenitude Economy: The Secret To Creating Jobs|url=https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/visualizing-a-plenitude-economy-the-secret-to-creating-jobs-that-wall-street-doesnt-want-you-to-know/|access-date=2020-10-14}}</ref>

==== ''After the Gig'' (2020)<ref name=":0" /> ====
{{main|After the Gig}} In ''After the Gig'', Schor explores the [[Gig worker|gig economy]], e.g. [[Uber]], [[Airbnb]], etc., and effects of such organizations on worker exploitation, carbon emissions, and racial discrimination. Looking at data extracted from thirteen cases, Schor comes to offer a better means for creating a shared and equitable economy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520325050/after-the-gig|title=After the Gig|language=en}}</ref>
