He is an Honorary Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand. In addition to publishing more than 60 academic papers, he has written or co-written 16 popular science and skeptical non-fiction books.

He is an expert in fields such as [[mass hysteria]] and [[mass psychogenic illness]]{{R|cuba2018}} and is frequently consulted by media during current events of sociological phenomena such as incidences of suspected mass hysteria or panic.

==Academic work==
Bartholomew first obtained a radio broadcasting certificate studying at [[SUNY Adirondack]] in 1977 followed in 1979 by a [[bachelor's degree]] in communications at [[Plattsburgh]]. By 1984 he had been awarded a [[master's degree]] in American sociology at [[State University of New York]].{{R|UA profile}} In 1992 he gained a masters in Australian sociology from [[Flinders University]] in [[Adelaide]], South Australia followed by a doctorate in sociology from [[James Cook University]] in [[Queensland]], Australia. Finally, in 2001 he gained his teaching qualification from Upper Valley Teachers Institute in [[social studies]].{{R|UA profile}}

Bartholomew has also lived and worked in Malaysia and in 2009 worked in sociology at [[Twintech International University College of Technology|International University College of Technology]].{{R|Illness not real}} In April 2010 he took up a teaching position at [[Botany Downs Secondary College]] in Auckland, New Zealand. He is currently an Honorary Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.{{R|UA profile}}

In 2012, Bartholomew published ''Australia's forgotten children: The corrupt state of education in the Northern Territory: A case study of educational apartheid at an aboriginal pretend school'' in which he uncovered human rights abuses of [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian aboriginal]] children who were being exposed to harmful [[asbestos]] in the [[Northern Territory]] with the knowledge of the Northern Territory [[Department of Education and Training (Australia)|Department of Education]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Australia's Forgotten Children: The Corrupt State of Education in the Northern Territory|url=http://www.teacherswithintegrity.com/index.php/8-content/19-why-teach-in-the-territory-the-site-the-nt-government-does-not-want-you-to-see#|website=Teachers With Integrity|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>

Bartholomew's principal area of academic contribution is in the field of [[mass psychogenic illness]], previously known as mass hysteria, both historical and present day cases, an area he has been studying for over 25 years.<ref name="atl2018">{{cite web|last1=Dimon|first1=Laura|title=What Witchcraft Is Facebook?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/what-witchcraft-is-facebook/279499/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=27 February 2018|date=2013-09-11}}</ref> He has written extensively about 600 notable instances including the [[Salem witch trials]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=DeCosta-Klipa|first1=Nik|title=The theory that may explain what was tormenting the afflicted in Salem's witch trials|url=https://www.boston.com/news/history/2017/10/31/the-theory-that-may-explain-what-was-tormenting-the-afflicted-in-salems-witch-trials|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref> the [[Le Roy, New York#2011 illness outbreak|2011 Le Roy illness]], which Bartholomew has described as "the first case of this magnitude to occur in the U.S. during the social networking era",<ref name=atl2018/> and present-day manifestations, most of which he has said have yet to be studied in-depth by sociologists. {{Quote|quote=As we enter the 21st century, epidemic hysteria will again mirror the times, likely thriving on the fear and uncertainty from terrorist threats and environmental concerns.

In 2016, Bartholomew investigated the 2012 case of an outbreak of [[hiccup]]s in [[Danvers, Massachusetts]] (originally Old Salem village), in which 24 young people were stricken with apparently uncontrollable hiccups. After requesting and reviewing state documents from the original investigation, he concluded the most likely explanation was a [[Mass psychogenic illness|psychogenic]] [[conversion disorder]] affecting the (predominantly) girls involved. He publicly stated the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Health]] had "knowingly issued an inaccurate, incomplete report...They have an obligation to issue accurate diagnoses, and patients have a right to know what made them sick" and filed official complaints of malpractice.<ref name="Buzz2018">{{cite web|last1=Vergano|first1=Dan|title=The Hiccuping Girls Of Old Salem|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/salem-hiccups-mystery|website=Buzzfeed|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>

Bartholomew has also drawn attention to the role of the internet in acting as an "[[echo chamber (media)|echo chamber]]" for spreading moral outrage; for example on [[social media]], pedophile allegations used as political weapons by supporters of the [[far-right politics|far right]] against [[Social liberalism|liberal]] celebrities, which mirrors earlier public outrage which took the form of the [[Red Scare]] (particularly [[McCarthyism]]) and the [[Lavender scare]] against homosexuals in US government positions.<ref name="ns2018">{{cite web |last1=Tait |first1=Amelia |title=How the alt-right wields and weaponises accusations of paedophilia |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2018/01/how-alt-right-wields-and-weaponises-accusations-paedophilia |website=[[New Statesman]] |accessdate=27 February 2018 }}</ref>

In 2020 he co-authored ''Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story Behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria'', a book on the sonic attack controversy in Cuba with Professor Robert W. Baloh, a neurologist at the [[UCLA Medical Center]]. The authors document dozens of similar examples of disorders that have essentially the same features as "Havana Syndrome", but were given different labels, from the 18th century belief that sounds from certain musical instruments were harmful to human health, to contemporary panics involving people living near wind turbines.<ref name=Havanna_Syndrome_book/>
In March 2020, Bartholomew was invited to attend a medical conference in Havana, Cuba, on the "attacks", where he repeated the claim that stress-induced mass psychogenic illness was the most likely cause.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rodríguez |first1=Andrea |agency=Associated Press |title=Scientists meet in Havana on diplomats' mystery illnesses |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/scientists-meet-havana-diplomats-mystery-illnesses-69346080 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=25 May 2020 |language=en |date=3 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Caraballoso |first1=Eric |title=Is there a "Havana Syndrome"? |url=https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/is-there-a-havana-syndrome/ |accessdate=25 May 2020 |work=OnCubaNews English |date=6 March 2020}}</ref>
