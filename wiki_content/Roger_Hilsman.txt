'''Roger Hilsman Jr.''' (November 23, 1919 – February 23, 2014) was an American soldier, government official, political scientist, and author. He saw action in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]] of World War II, first with [[Merrill's Marauders]], getting wounded in combat, and then as a guerilla leader for the [[Office of Strategic Services]]. He later became an aide and adviser to President [[John F. Kennedy]], and briefly to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], in the [[U.S. State Department]] while he served as [[Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] in 1961 to 1963 and [[Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs]] in 1963 to 1964.

There, Hilsman was a key and controversial figure in the development of U.S. policies in [[South Vietnam]] during the early stages of American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].  He was an advocate of a strategy that emphasized the political nature of the conflict as much as the military aspect and was a proponent of the removal from power of South Vietnamese president [[Ngô Đình Diệm]].  Hilsman left government in 1964 to teach at [[Columbia University]] and retired in 1990. He wrote many books about American foreign policy and international relations. He was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee for election to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1972 but lost in the general election.

==Early life==
Hilsman was born on November 23, 1919, in [[Waco, Texas]],<ref name="enc-vnwar-rh"/> the son of Roger Hilsman, Sr., a career officer with the United States Army, and Emma Prendergast Hilsman.<ref name="whos-84">{{cite book | title=Who's Who in America 1984–1985 Volume 1 | edition=43rd | publisher=[[Marquis Who's Who]] | location=Chicago | year=1984 | page=1501}}</ref><ref name="nyt-mitn-63">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/08/30/121663982.pdf | title=Man in the News: Roger Hilsman Jr.: Prepared for Crises | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 30, 1963}}</ref>  He lived in Waco only briefly,<ref name="dean"/> growing up on a series of military posts.<ref name="wapo-obit"/>  He attended public schools for a while in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].<ref name="cby">{{cite book | editor = Moritz, Charles | title=Current Biography Yearbook 1964 | publisher=[[H.

After spending a year at [[Millard's Preparatory School]] in Washington, DC,<ref name="cby"/> and another traveling around Europe, including a visit to Nazi Germany,<ref name="wapo-obit"/> Hilsman attended the [[United States Military Academy]] and graduated in 1943<ref name="enc-vnwar-rh"/> with a B.S. degree and as a [[Second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]].<ref name="cby"/>

==World War II==
Following U.S. entry into World War II, Hilsman's father, a colonel, fought under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] during the [[Philippines campaign (1941–1942)|Japanese invasion of the Philippines]].<ref name="dean"/>  Two weeks into the conflict, newspaper reports described Colonel Hilsman as still holding [[Metro Davao|Davao]] on the island of [[Mindanao]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/12/21/105411801.pdf | title=Led by Colonel Hilsman | agency=[[United Press International]] | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 21, 1941}}</ref> Later reports reflected his retreat to [[Malaybalay]] after he had faced overwhelming Japanese forces, followed by another move onto the island of [[Negros (island)|Negros]]<ref name="nyt-odds">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/10/12/85599829.pdf | title=700 Against 25,000 Were Odds in Davao | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 12, 1942}}</ref> and he was captured by the Japanese once all the islands had surrendered in 1942.<ref name="dean"/>

After leaving West Point the younger Hilsman was immediately posted to the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|South-East Asian Theatre]] and joined the [[Merrill's Marauders]] long-range penetration jungle warfare unit, which fought the Japanese during the [[Burma Campaign]].<ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/> There, he found morale to be poor due to typhus outbreaks and unhappiness with the generals leading the unit.<ref name="day-90"/> He participated in infantry operations during the [[Merrill's Marauders#Myitkyina and the end|battle for Myitkyina]] in May 1944 and suffered multiple stomach wounds from a Japanese machine gun while on a reconnaissance patrol.<ref name="enc-vnwar-rh"/><ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/><ref name="dean"/>

After recovering in army field hospitals, Hilsman joined the [[Office of Strategic Services]].<ref name="dean"/> Now a [[first lieutenant#United States|lieutenant]],<ref name="peers-brelis"/> he at first served as a liaison officer to the [[British Army]] in [[British Burma|Burma]].<ref name="dean"/>  He then volunteered to be put in command of a [[guerrilla warfare]] battalion, organized and supplied by [[OSS Detachment 101]], of some 300 local partisans, mercenaries, and irregulars of varying ethnicities, operating behind the lines of the Japanese in Burma.<ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/><ref name="dean"/>

There, he developed an interest in guerrilla tactics and personally found them to be preferable to being part of infantry assaults.<ref name="dean"/><ref name="day-90"/> By early 1945, Hilsman was considered, as Detachment 101 commander [[William R. Peers]] later stated, to be one of a number of the guerillas' "good... junior officers, every one outstanding and experienced."<ref name="peers-brelis"/> Hilsman's group made hit-and-run attacks on Japanese forces and kept a Japanese regiment ten times its size occupied far from the front lines,<ref name="dean"/> all while waging its own battle with the ever-present leeches and other insects and various diseases.<ref name="day-90"/> In one particular engagement in May 1945, Hilsman led a mixed company of [[Kachin people|Kachins]], [[Bamar people|Burmese]], and [[Karen people|Karens]] in staging successful raids in the area between [[Lawksawk]] and [[Taunggyi]] that culminated in a carefully-orchestrated ambush that caused a hundred casualties among the Japanese at no cost to the guerillas.<ref name="peers-brelis">{{cite book | first=William R. | last=Peers | author-link=William R.

Soon after the Japanese surrender in 1945, Hilsman was part of an OSS group that staged a parachute mission into [[Manchuria]] to liberate American prisoners held in a Japanese camp near [[Mukden]].<ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/> There, he found his father, who became one of the first prisoners to be freed.<ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/>  His father asked as they hugged, "What took you so long?"<ref name="nyt-obit">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/us/politics/roger-hilsman-adviser-to-kennedy-on-vietnam-dies-at-94.html | title=Roger Hilsman, 94, Adviser to Kennedy on Vietnam | first=Douglas | last=Martin | newspaper=The New York Times | date=March 11, 2014 | page=B15}}</ref> At some point, Hilsman was promoted to [[captain (United States O-3)|captain]].<ref name="1000d"/> (Decades later, Hilsman related his wartime experiences in his 1990 memoir ''American Guerrilla: My War Behind Japanese Lines''.<ref name="day-90">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19900813&id=o0JHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dvgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3313,2578899 | title=A guerrilla's life in brutal Burma during WW II | newspaper=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]] | location=New London | date=August 13, 1990 | first=Christine | last=Woodside | pages=A1, A12}}</ref>)

Returning from the war, Hilsman served in the OSS as assistant chief of Far East intelligence operations in 1945 to 1946, and once the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] had been created, he served in it in the role of special assistant to executive officer in 1946 to 1947<ref name="whos-84"/> (he belonged to the Central Intelligence Group during the interim period between the two organizations).

==Student, lecturer and researcher==
Hilsman married Eleanor Willis Hoyt in 1946.<ref name="whos-84"/> They raised four children together.<ref name="whos-84"/><ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/> Sponsored by the Army, Hilsman attended [[Yale University]],<ref name="puw-54"/> earning a master's degree in 1950 and a Ph.D. in 1951 in political science.<ref name="whos-84"/><ref name="dean"/>  He specialized in [[international relations]]<ref name="cby"/> and he studied under noted professors [[Arnold Wolfers]] and [[William T.

By 1951, Hilsman had risen to the rank of [[major (United States)|major]].<ref name="whos-84"/> He worked on planning for the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] with the Joint American Military Advance Group in London in 1950 to 1952 and as part of the International Policies Division of the [[United States European Command]] in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1952 to 1953.<ref name="whos-84"/><ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/><ref name="cby"/><ref name="puw-54"/>  Waiting for the end of hostilities in the [[Korean War]], he resigned from the Army in 1953 but kept reserve status.<ref name="whos-84"/><ref name="puw-54">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxFbAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA9-PA19 | title=O.S.S.

Hilsman turned to academia and became a research associate and lecturer in international politics at the [[Center of International Studies]] at [[Princeton University]] from 1953 to 1956 and a part-time lecturer and research associate at the [[Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research]], which was affiliated with the [[School of Advanced International Studies]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], from 1957 to 1961.<ref name="whos-84"/><ref name="cby"/> In 1956, he published the book ''Strategic Intelligence and National Decisions''.

He was the chief of the foreign affairs division of the [[Congressional Research Service]] within the [[Library of Congress]] in 1956 to 1958 and then deputy director for research for them in 1958 to 1961.<ref name="whos-84"/><ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/> There, he met Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] and other members of Congress interested in foreign affairs.<ref name="dean"/>

==Kennedy administration==
During staffing of the incoming [[Kennedy administration]], the nominee for [[Under Secretary of State]], [[Chester Bowles]], aggressively sought academics and journalists who would be committed to the ideals of the [[New Frontier]].<ref name="1000d">{{cite book | author-link=Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. | last=Schlesinger Jr. | first=Arthur M. | title=A Thousand Days: John F.

His duty was to analyze foreign events and trends as part of the department's long-range planning.<ref name="enc-vnwar-rh"/>  Hilsman soon became a key planner within the administration's foreign policy circles.<ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/> Like many of the "New Frontiersmen," he had fought with distinction as a junior officer in World War II.<ref name="1000d"/>  Hilsman was particularly effective at talking to members of the U.S. Congress because that military background and war record appealed to hardliners and his academic history and intellectual leanings appealed to those more of that bent.<ref name="dean"/>

[[File:Doc 39 Hilsman on IRBMS.pdf|thumb|upright=0.7|left|A Hilsman memorandum in November 1962 tried to account for the deployments of Soviet intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba]]
His background in guerrilla warfare led him in 1961, together with [[Walt Rostow]], to push for the American armed forces and the State Department to emphasize [[counterguerrilla]] training.<ref name="1000d"/> Hilsman was involved for more than two months in the U.S. responses to Soviet actions during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962, including developing informal communications with Soviet officials and the briefing of congressional leaders.<ref name="wapo-obit"/><ref name="cby"/><ref name="nyt-obit"/><ref name="1000d"/> He was also involved in the State Department's analysis of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] and the possible conditions for future warming in [[China–United States relations|Sino-American relations]].<ref name="cby"/>

Hilsman became one of the main architects of [[War in Vietnam (1959–63)|American policy in Vietnam during the early 1960s]] and in January 1962 presented the plan "A Strategic Concept for South Vietnam."<ref name="enc-vnwar-rh">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History | edition=2nd | editor-first=Spencer C. | editor-last=Tucker | publisher=ABC-CLIO | location=Santa Barbara, California | year=2011 | first=Robert G. | last=Mangrum | contribution=Hilsman, Roger | pages=487–488}}</ref> It stated that the war was primarily a political struggle and proposed policies that emphasized that the Vietnamese in rural areas were the key to victory.<ref name="enc-vnwar-rh"/> It also recommended for the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] to start using guerrilla tactics.<ref name="enc-vnwar-rh"/>   Out of the report came Kennedy's approval of American participation in the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]], the relocation of rural peasants into villages consolidated and reshaped to create a defensible, networked perimeter, with the goal of removing population from contact and influence with the [[Viet Cong]]. The implementation of the program by the South Vietnamese government became problematic, however, and Hilsman later stated that its execution was a "total misunderstanding of what the [Strategic Hamlet] program should try to do."<ref>Hilsman, Roger, ''To Move a Nation'', p. 440.</ref>

In 1962, reports from American journalists in South Vietnam about the progress of the conflict with the Viet Cong, and the characteristics of the South Vietnamese government under President [[Ngô Đình Diệm]], differed from the picture that the American military was portraying.<ref name="1000d"/> Kennedy became alarmed, and in December 1962, Hilsman, together with [[Michael Forrestal]] of the [[U.S. National Security Council]] staff, were sent by Kennedy on a fact-finding mission to South Vietnam.<ref name="enc-vnwar-hfr"/> The [[Hilsman–Forrestal Report]] was delivered to Kennedy on January 25, 1963.<ref name="enc-vnwar-hfr">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History | edition=2nd | editor-first=Spencer C. | editor-last=Tucker | publisher=ABC-CLIO | location=Santa Barbara, California | year=2011 | first=Robert G. | last=Mangrum | contribution=Hilsman–Forrestal Report | page=488}}</ref> It described weaknesses in the South Vietnamese government; the corruption of Diệm, his brother [[Ngô Đình Nhu]], and their cohorts; and the increasing isolation of and lack of support for the Diệm regime from the South Vietnamese people.<ref name="enc-vnwar-hfr"/> Overall, however, the report came to some optimistic conclusions:<ref name="enc-vnwar-hfr"/> "Our overall judgment, in sum, is that we are probably winning, but certainly more slowly than we had hoped. At the rate it is now going the war will last longer than we would like, cost more in terms of both lives and money than we anticipated...."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v03/d19 | title=Memorandum From the Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (Hilsman) and Michael V. Forrestal of the National Security Council Staff to the President | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] | date=January 25, 1963}}</ref>  The report thus contributed to the escalation of American involvement in Vietnam and to growing doubts in U.S. government circles about the usefulness of the Diệm regime.<ref name="enc-vnwar-hfr"/>

[[Image:JFK, DPM Malaya, Hilsman.jpg|thumb|right|Hilsman (far right) at the White House in April 1963 during a presentation of gifts with Kennedy and Deputy Prime Minister of Malaya [[Tun Abdul Razak]]]]
In March 1963, the White House announced that Hilsman would become [[Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs]], replacing [[Averell Harriman]] (who was promoted to an undersecretary position).<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/03/14/94305398.pdf | title=M'Ghee Is Chosen As Envoy to Bonn | first=Marjorie | last=Hunter | newspaper=The New York Times | date=March 14, 1963}}</ref> Hilsman had risen quickly in the government bureaucracy, partly because Kennedy liked his willingness to challenge the military.<ref name="wapo-obit"/> A ''New York Times'' profile that year described Hilsman as "a restless, bouncy, aggressive but deeply reflective man".<ref name="nyt-mitn-63"/><ref name="cby"/> Hilsman assumed the new position in May 1963. The same month, the [[Buddhist crisis]] began in South Vietnam, which featured a series of repressive acts by the South Vietnamese government and a campaign of civil resistance led mainly by [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Buddhist]] monks. Doubts grew further about Diệm, and within the Kennedy administration Hilsman became the most outspoken proponent of a coup against Diệm.<ref name="jones">{{cite book| first=Howard |last=Jones| year=2003| title= Death of a Generation: How the Assassinations of Diem and JFK Prolonged the Vietnam War | publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York | pages=9, 316, 321, 421, 425}}</ref>

On August 24, 1963, in the wake of [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raids against Buddhist pagodas across the country]] by Nhu's [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|special forces]], Hilsman, along with Forrestal and Harriman, drafted and sent [[Cable 243]], an important message from the State Department to U.S. Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] In South Vietnam. The message declared that Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu remaining in a position of power and ordered Lodge to pressure Diệm to remove his brother and that if Diệm refused, the United States would explore the possibility for alternative leadership in South Vietnam. The cable had the overall effect of giving tacit American approval for a coup against the regime.<ref name="enc-vnwar-rh"/> Hilsman was the point man for the cable – some contemporaries referred to it as the "Roger Hilsman cable" – as it was approved and sent while many higher-ranking officials were out of town, and each of the officials who were called to approve it did so because he thought some other official had approved it.<ref name="jones"/> The events surrounding the sending of the cable led to Kennedy's becoming quite upset over the disorganization within his government.<ref>{{cite book | first=Richard | last=Reeves | author-link=Richard Reeves (American writer) | title=President Kennedy: Profile of Power | url=https://archive.org/details/presidentkennedy00reev_0 | url-access=registration | publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] | location=New York | year=1993 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/presidentkennedy00reev_0/page/565 565–568]}}</ref> The events have also long been criticized as at best an example of a bizarrely poor decisionmaking process<ref name="jones"/> and at worst a case in which a small group of secondary, anti-Diệm figures was able to circumvent normal procedures with a consequent harmful effect on the situation in Vietnam.<ref name="hpford">{{cite book | title=CIA and the Vietnam Policymakers: Three Episodes 1962–1968 | first=Harold P. | last=Ford | publisher=[[Center for the Study of Intelligence]], Central Intelligence Agency | year=1997 | pages=29–33, 40–41}}</ref>

On November 1, the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup]] came. Although it was conducted by South Vietnamese generals, they had been encouraged by the United States and so there was shared responsibility.<ref name="lewy">{{cite book | first=Guenter | last=Lewy | author-link=Guenter Lewy | title=America in Vietnam | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | pages=27–28, 30| title-link=America in Vietnam}}</ref> American decisionmakers did not want the coup to involve assassination of the current leaders,<ref name="jones"/><ref name="lewy"/> but by the next day, [[arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm|Diệm and brother had been arrested and assassinated]]. The coup set off a period of political instability in South Vietnam that opened the door to more American involvement.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>

Hilsman was one of the academics and intellectuals in the administration who were later grouped by the author [[David Halberstam]] in his book as ''[[The Best and the Brightest]]'' for the misguided foreign policy that they crafted and its disastrous consequences. Hilsman's role has been variously interpreted. [[Mark Moyar]]'s 2006 book ''Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965'' paints Hilsman as one of the key Americans who shortsightedly and arrogantly pushed out Diệm when, Moyar says, the struggle against the communists was being won.<ref>{{cite book | first=Mark | last=Moyar | author-link=Mark Moyar | title=Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York | year=2006 | pages=218–228, 236–243, 279}}</ref> [[Guenter Lewy]] portrays Hilsman as being "farsighted and correct" in his perspective from 1964 and on, while the scholar Howard Jones views the coup against Diệm that Hilsman acted in favor of as "a tragically misguided move."<ref name="jones"/>

==Johnson administration==
Following Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, Hilsman stayed in his position under the new president, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].  But Johnson sought a narrower range of opinion on foreign policy matters than Kennedy had and Hilsman, along with a number of other formerly influential State Department figures, was now not being listened to.<ref name="hpford"/>  Furthermore, by this time, in the words of Halberstam, "[Hilsman] had probably made more enemies than anyone else in the upper levels of government."<ref name="halber">{{cite book | title=The Best and the Brightest | first=David | last=Halberstam | author-link=David Halberstam | publisher=Random House | year= 1972 | pages=374–375| title-link=The Best and the Brightest }}</ref>  Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] disliked Hilsman for his constant questioning of military estimates and forthrightness, Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] had been angered by Hilsman's tendency to go circumvent proper channels and by the friction Hilsman caused with the military, and as vice president, Johnson had not liked Hilsman's brashness or his policies.<ref name="halber"/>  Kennedy as Hilsman's protector was gone, and Johnson determined that he wanted Hilsman out.<ref name="halber"/>

At the same time, Hilsman disagreed with Johnson's approach to the Vietnam War, viewing the new president as primarily seeking a military solution there rather than a political one.<ref name="nytbr">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/08/13/106224599.pdf | title=Policy Politics | first=Walter | last=Johnson | work=The New York Times Book Review | date=August 13, 1967 }}</ref>  Not liking anyone to quit outright, the president offered the position of Ambassador to the Philippines, but Hilsman declined.<ref name="halber"/><ref name="langguth"/>  And while Hilsman would later say that he had initiated the resignation, Rusk later stated: "I fired him".<ref name="e-n-67">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19671013&id=FadRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LxEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7378,2232679 | title=Intellectuals' War Criticism Roils Rusk | first=Rowland | last=Evans | author-link=Rowland Evans | first2 = Robert | last2 = Novak | author-link2=Robert Novak | newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel | date=October 13, 1967 | page=16}}</ref>

==Professor and political candidate==
In his resignation letter, Hilsman had said that he considered university teaching his "basic profession".<ref name="nyt-resign"/>
Hilsman became a professor at [[Columbia University]] in 1964,<ref name="nyt-cu-appt">{{cite news | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/03/05/106943108.pdf | title= Hilsman Appointed to Post at Columbia | newspaper=The New York Times | date=March 5, 1964}}</ref> joining the Department of Public Law and Government within its [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|School of International Affairs]].<ref name="cby"/>  The course he gave on foreign policy decision-making became known for the anecdotes he told about the famous figures in the Kennedy administration and for the political theory he introduced in explanation.<ref name="nyt-cg69">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/09/20/78394339.pdf | title=Tables Are Turned on Teachers at Columbia as Student Guide Grades Them | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 20, 1969 }}</ref><ref name="cds-ret"/>  Indeed, Hilsman became known as one of the expansive "Kennedy network",<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/11/11/111748674.pdf | title=The Kennedy Network | first=William H. | last=Honan |author-link=William H.

Hilsman was one of the institute's most prolific book authors.<ref name="abf-hist"/>  Of particular note was his 1967 work ''To Move a Nation: The Politics of Foreign Policy in the Administration of John F.

Hilsman continued to speak publicly, in print and on television, regarding what he thought should be done in Vietnam, such as in August 1964, when he warned against over-militarizing the conflict,<ref name="wapo-obit"/> and in mid-1967, when he said the war was not politically "winnable" and that the U.S. should scale down its military involvement and stop the ongoing [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing campaign against the North]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/06/05/90353507.pdf | title=Hilsman Assails Bombing Policy | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 5, 1967}}</ref>  He consistently maintained that had Kennedy lived, he would not have escalated the war the way Johnson did.<ref name="wapo-obit"/>  Hilsman was an ardent supporter of [[Robert F.

Hilsman later tried his own hand at electoral politics: In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1972#Connecticut|1972 Congressional elections]], he ran for election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee for [[Connecticut's 2nd congressional district]].<ref name="nyt-1972-run">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/04/11/81564299.pdf | title=Hilsman to Seek House Seat | newspaper=The New York Times | date=April 11, 1972}}</ref>  He secured the Democratic nomination in a race where few Democrats wanted to run or thought the party had much of a chance of winning.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19720127&id=syIiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mXQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=729,4105793 | title=Aah, a Candidate | newspaper=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]] | location=New London | date=January 29, 1972 | page=10}}</ref>  He campaigned on domestic issues as well as those of foreign policy, presenting a five-point plan for increasing employment in eastern Connecticut.<ref name="cds-72"/>  He predicted his chances of winning were directly linked to Democratic presidential nominee [[George McGovern]]'s performance in the state against [[Richard Nixon]], the incumbent whom Hilsman termed a threat to civil liberties.<ref name="cds-72">{{cite news | url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19721003-01.2.6&srpos=18&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-roger+hilsman----- | title=Candidate Hilsman Attacks Nixon | newspaper=Columbia Daily Spectator | date=October 3, 1972 | pages=1, 3}}</ref>  McGovern lost in a landslide, and Hilsman lost the congressional general election to the Republican incumbent, [[Robert H.
