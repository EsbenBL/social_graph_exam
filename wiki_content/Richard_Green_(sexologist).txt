He was also the founding president of the [[International Academy of Sex Research]] (1975),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/identities/profiles/r_green.pdf|title=Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences}}</ref> which made the ''Archives'' its official publication.<ref name="Reiss2006">{{cite book|author=Ira L.

During his medical studies at Johns Hopkins, Green met [[John Money]], who was an assistant professor there, and started collaborating with him on research, initially on boys displaying substantial cross-gender behavior. In Money's obituary, Green acknowledges Money and [[Robert Stoller]], as well as his father, Leo H. Green, for having set the course for his life and career. In the mid-1960s, Money introduced Green to [[Harry Benjamin]], whom Green acknowledges as having "further honed" his career.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Green, R.|title=John Money, Ph.D. (July 8, 1921 – July 7, 2006): A Personal Obituary|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9132-5|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=35|issue=6| pages=629–632|year=2006|pmid=17123149|s2cid=44468647}}</ref> In 1969 Green and Money co-edited "Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment", published by Johns Hopkins Press.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Green was founding editor of ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' in 1971, serving as Editor for 30 years. In 1974 Green and the board of the new journal established the [[International Academy of Sex Research]], with Green as the founding president; the ''Archives'' became the official publication of the Academy.<ref name="green1985">Green R (1985). The International Academy of Sex Research: In the beginning. ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' 14: 293–302.</ref> The new organization had a more selective membership than [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] (SSSS), which published the leading US sexology journal of the time, ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]]''. The IASR membership has a more medical and biological emphasis, and only accepts applications from published researchers. The IASR also has a more international approach, alternatively meeting in the US and other countries every year. Eventually, the ''Archives'' became a premier journal in its field.<ref name="Reiss2006"/> Green retired as Editor of ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' in 2001 and Editorship was continued by [[Kenneth Zucker]].<ref name="green2001">Green R (2001). A 30 years' thank you. ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' 30: 633–637.</ref>

In 1979 Green was a founding committee member of the [[Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association]] and served as president from 1997 to 1999. He previously directed the [[human sexuality]] program at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]].<ref name="brody1982">Brody, Jane E. (26 January 1982).

Green was co-counsel for [[Elke Sommer]] in her [[libel]] suit against [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]].<ref name="pool1993">Pool, Bob (9 December 1993). $3.3-Million Libel Award in Sommer-Gabor Feud.

===Views and controversies===
During the APA's heated debate in the early 1970s about the declassification of homosexuality as a mental illness, Green argued forcefully in favor of declassification.<ref name=greenpedo/> He argued that the grounds for deciding the issue should be the "historical and cross-cultural groundings in homosexual expression, associated psychiatric features accompanying a homosexual orientation, the emotional consequences to the homosexual of societal condemnation, and behaviors of other species".<ref name=greenpedo/> Green applauded the eventual APA decision while strongly criticizing the fact that the administration put it to a vote, saying that such "a shotgun marriage between science and democracy" was "ludicrous".<ref name=greenpedo/>

In his work, on gender identity in children, Green used common English expressions like "[[sissy]] boy" and "[[tomboy]]" in the titles of some of his publications. His choice of terminology was criticized as offensive.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Green, R.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1023/A:1021876609813|title=The "T" Word|year=2003|pmid=12597265|s2cid=152161247|issn=0004-0002|eissn=1573-2800}}</ref>

In 2002, he initiated a debate in a special issue of the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' regarding the extent to which [[pedophilia]] should be classified as a [[mental disorder]] by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], without impinging on the legal and law enforcement aspects. It concluded that sexual arousal to children is subjectively reported "in a substantial minority of "normal" people", and reviewed the level of social acceptance of this historically, but stated that such observations may not entail cultural or legal acceptance today.<ref name=greenpedo>Green, R. (2002). [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/pedophilia.htm Is pedophilia a mental disorder?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012005114/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/pedophilia.htm |date=12 October 2010}} ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', '''31''', 2002.</ref> The paper also raised specific concerns about the DSM-IV definition, some of which were later acknowledged by [[Ray Blanchard]] in his literature review for the [[DSM-5]] workgroup,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Sex%20and%20GID%20Lit%20Reviews/Paraphilias/DSMV.PEDO.pdf|title=DSM-5}}</ref> which proposed a more general nomenclature distinction between [[paraphilia]]s and [[paraphilic disorder]]s; this proposal is part of the DSM-5 draft.<ref>https://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=186 (see the 'Rationale' tab)</ref> In 2010, however, Green criticized in stronger terms [[Ray Blanchard#Pedophilia and hebephilia|Blanchard's proposal]] to introduce [[hebephilia]] as a [[mental disorder]] in the DSM-5 (as a subtype the proposed pedohebophilic disorder). Pointing to the legal age of sexual consent in several countries of Europe, this would declare 19-year-olds engaged sexually with 14-year-olds as having a mental disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Green, R.|title=Sexual preference for 14-year-olds as a mental disorder: you can't be serious!!

In terms of research on [[biology and sexual orientation]], Green was optimistic about progress and told a reporter that "I suspect that at least in your lifetime we will find a gene that contributes substantially to sexual orientation."<ref>Chandler Burr [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199706/homosexuality-biology/4 Homosexuality and Biology].
