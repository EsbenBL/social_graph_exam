The term ''egalitarianism'' has two distinct definitions in modern English,<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/egalitarianism |title=Egalitarianism |dictionary=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}</ref> either as a political [[doctrine]] that all people should be treated as equals and have the same [[Political freedom|political]], [[Economic freedom|economic]], [[Social justice|social]] and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/egalitarianism |title=Egalitarianism |work=American Heritage Dictionary |year=2003}}</ref> or as a social philosophy advocating the [[Redistribution of income and wealth|removal of economic inequalities among people]], [[economic egalitarianism]], or the [[Decentralization|decentralization of power]].

Some specifically focused egalitarian concerns include [[communism]], [[Equality before the law|legal egalitarianism]], [[luck egalitarianism]], [[political egalitarianism]], [[Gender equality|gender egalitarianism]], [[racial equality]], equality of opportunity, and [[Christian egalitarianism]]. Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical.

=== Legal egalitarianism ===
{{details|Equality before the law}}
{{liberalism sidebar}}
One argument is that [[liberalism]] provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and providing the correct conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights.<ref>{{cite conference |author=Rosales, José María |url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Poli/PoliRosa.htm |title=Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy |conference=20th World Contress on Philosophy: Political Philosophy |date=12 March 2010}}</ref>

==== Equality of person ====
The [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights of 1689]] and the [[United States Constitution]] use only the term person in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities, except for a reference to men in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason; and a rule of  proportional Congressional representation in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

As the rest of the Constitution, in its operative language the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] uses the term person, stating that "nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws".

==== Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities ====
An example of this form is the [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014]] which provides that "men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties".

==== Gender equality ====
The motto "''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]''" was used during the [[French Revolution]] and is still used as an official motto of the French government. The 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind.

The [[Declaration of Independence of the United States]] is an example of an assertion of equality of men as "[[All men are created equal]]" and the wording of men and man is a reference to both men and women, i.e. mankind. [[John Locke]] is sometimes considered the founder of this form.

Many state constitutions in the United States also use the rights of man language rather than rights of person since the noun man has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mann and Gender in Old English Prose: A Pilot Study|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11061-016-9489-1.pdf|url-status=live|journal=Neophilologus|year=2017|doi=10.1007/s11061-016-9489-1|last1=Rauer|first1=Christine|volume=101|pages=139–158|hdl=10023/8978|s2cid=55817181|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

[[Feminism]] is greatly informed by egalitarian philosophy, being a gender-focused philosophy of equality. Feminism is distinguished from egalitarianism by also existing as a political and social movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fiss|first=Owen|date=1994|title=What is feminism|journal=Arizona State Law Journal|volume=26|pages=413–428|via=HeinOnline}}</ref>

=== Social egalitarianism ===
{{socialism sidebar}}
At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[social anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]], [[left-libertarianism]] and [[progressivism]], some of which propound [[economic egalitarianism]]. Whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question. [[Anti-egalitarianism]]<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sidanius, Jim |display-authors=etal |title=Social dominance orientation, anti-egalitarianism and the political psychology of gender: An extension and cross-cultural replication |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=30 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=41–67 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(200001/02)30:1<41::aid-ejsp976>3.0.co;2-o}}</ref> or [[elitism]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://englishthesaurus.net/antonym/egalitarian/ |title=Antonyms for egalitarian |website=English Thesaurus |access-date=28 September 2018}}</ref> is opposition to egalitarianism.

==== Economic {{anchor|Economic egalitarianism|Economics|Finance|Financial}} ====
A very early example of equality of what might be described as outcome economic egalitarianism is the Chinese philosophy of [[agriculturalism]] which held that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon egalitarian self-sufficiency.<ref name="dw">{{cite book |last=Denecke |first=Wiebke |year=2011 |page=38 |title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi |publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref>

In [[socialism]], [[social ownership]] of [[means of production]] is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership the [[surplus product]] generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners, thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another. Although the economist [[Karl Marx]] is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian, Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether. Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles concerning specific [[economic system]]s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/#KarMarEquRig |title=Egalitarianism |date=16 August 2002 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=20 November 2013}}</ref>

The American economist [[John Roemer]] has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism. Roemer attempts to reformulate [[Marxist analysis]] to accommodate normative principles of [[distributive justice]], shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice. Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice, the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation is proportional to the value of the labor one expends in production ("[[To each according to his contribution]]") is inadequate. Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized.<ref name="Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions, 2008">{{cite journal |title=Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions |author=Roemer, John |year=2008 |journal=Eastern Economic Journal |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=14–26 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.eej.9050011|s2cid=153503350 }}</ref>

=== Egalitarianism and non-human animals ===
Many philosophers, including Ingmar Persson,<ref>{{cite book |author=Persson, I. |year=1993 |contribution=A basis for (interspecies) equality |editor1=Cavalieri, P. |editor2=Singer, P. |title=The Great Ape Project |place=New York, NY |publisher=St. Martin’s Press |pages=183–193}}</ref> [[Peter Vallentyne]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vallentyne, P. |year=2005 |title=Of mice and men: Equality and animals |journal=Journal of Ethics |volume=9 |issue=3–4 |pages=403–433 |doi=10.1007/s10892-005-3509-x|hdl=10355/10183 |s2cid=13151744 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Nils Holtug,<ref>{{cite book |author=Holtug, N. |year=2007 |contribution=Equality for animals |editor1=Ryberg, J. |editor2=Petersen, T.S. |editor3=Wolf, C. |title=New Waves in Applied Ethics |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=1–24}}</ref> [[Catia Faria]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Faria, C. |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/5911405 |title=Equality, priority and nonhuman animals |journal=Dilemata: International Journal of Applied Ethics |volume=14 |pages=225–236}}</ref> and [[Lewis Gompertz]],<ref>Gompertz, L. (1997 [1824]) Moral inquiries on the situation of man and of brutes, London: Open Gate.</ref> have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well. Philosopher [[Oscar Horta]] has further argued that "[e]galitarianism implies rejecting [[speciesism]], and in practice, it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals" and that we should aid [[wild animal suffering|animals suffering in nature]].<ref name="Horta2014">{{cite journal |last=Horta |first=Oscar |date=25 November 2014  |title=Egalitarianism and Animals |url=https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/bts/vol19/iss1/5 |journal=Between the Species |volume=19 |issue=1}}</ref> Furthermore, Horta argues that "because [nonhuman animals] are worse off in comparison to humans, egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests of nonhuman animals".<ref name="Horta2014" />

=== Religious and spiritual egalitarianism ===
{{expand section|date=June 2020}}

==== Islam ====
The [[Quran]] states: "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Translation |url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=49&verse=13 |website=corpus.quran.com |access-date=30 December 2019}}</ref> [[Muhammad]] echoed these egalitarian sentiments, sentiments that clashed with the practices of the pre-Islamic cultures. In a review of Louise Marlow's ''Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought,'' [[Ismail Poonawala]] wrote: "With the establishment of the Arab-Muslim Empire, however, this egalitarian notion, as well as other ideals, such as social justice and social service, that is, alleviating suffering and helping the needy, which constituted an integral part of the Islamic teaching, slowly receded into the background. The explanation given for this change generally reiterates the fact that the main concern of the ruling authorities became the consolidation of their power and the administration of the state rather than upholding and implementing those Islamic ideals nurtured by the Qur'an and the Prophet."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Poonawala |first1=Ismail |author-link1=Ismail Poonawala |title=Reviewed Work: Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought by Louise Marlow |journal=Iranian Studies |date=Summer 1999 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=405–407 |jstor=4311272 }}</ref>

==== Christianity ====
The [[Bible]] states: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."<ref>{{cite web |title=(NIV) - Galatians 3:28 NIV - Biblia.com |url=https://biblia.com/bible/niv/galatians/3/28 |website=biblia.com |access-date=4 October 2020}}</ref> In 1957, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] cited the passage in a pamphlet opposing [[racial segregation in the United States]].

She argues that the verse points to a [[utopian]], [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] community.<ref name=Neutel/>

=== Modern egalitarianism theory ===
Modern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically, politically and socially. Modern egalitarianism theory, or&nbsp;new egalitarianism, outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost,{{clarify|date=June 2020}} then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other. In essence, the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talents—these differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.millenium.itesm.mx/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&sid=f2c02b96-fed4-4085-a57d-9fef664ae057%40sessionmgr101 |title=Egalitarianism: Fair and equal?

== Reception {{anchor|criticisms}} ==
The [[cultural theory of risk]] holds egalitarianism, with [[fatalism]] termed as its opposite,<ref name="Thompson 1990"/> as defined by a negative attitude towards rules and principles; and a positive attitude towards group decision-making.<ref name="Thompson 1990"/> The theory distinguishes between [[Hierarchy|hierarchists]], who are positive towards both rules and groups; and egalitarianists, who are positive towards groups, but negative towards rules.<ref name="Thompson 1990">{{cite book |author1=Thompson |display-authors=etal |title=Cultural Theory |url=https://archive.org/details/culturaltheory0000thom |url-access=registration |year=1990}}{{full citation needed |reason=authors' names, publisher, place of publ., pages etc. missing|date=November 2019}}</ref>

This is by definition a form of [[anarchist]] equality as referred to by [[Alexander Berkman]]. Thus, the fabric of an egalitarianist society is held together by [[cooperation]] and implicit [[peer pressure]] rather than by explicit rules and punishment. Thompson ''et al.'' theorize that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianism, hierarchist, [[individualist]], [[fatalist]] or [[Autonomy|autonomist]], will be inherently unstable as the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. Although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognized by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles.<ref name="Thompson 1990"/> Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group, namely autonomists or individualists. Berkman suggests that "equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity. [...] Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact. [...] Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is an equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality. [...] Far from leveling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse."<ref>{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Berkman |title=What is Anarchism? |pages=164–165}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>

=== Marxism ===
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] believed that an [[Proletarian internationalism|international]] [[proletarian revolution]] would bring about a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]] which would then eventually give way to a [[Communism|communist stage of social development]] which would be a classless, stateless, moneyless, humane society erected on [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and the principle of "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs]]". [[Marxism]] rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest such as a universal notion of equality, but it was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires, making Marx's notion of [[communist society]] radically individualistic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Allen|year=2014|url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf|chapter=Karl Marx on Equality|title=The Free Development of Each: Studies on Freedom, Right, and Ethics in Classical German Philosophy|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199685530.001.0001|isbn=9780199685530|quote=Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes. [...] A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed. It would instead be a society in which individuals freely act as the truly human individuals they are. Marx's radical communism was, in this way, also radically individualistic.}}</ref>

Marx was a proponent of two principles, with the first ("[[To each according to his contribution]]") being applied to socialism and the second ("To each according to their needs") to an advanced communist society. Although his position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Kai|date=August 1987|title=Rejecting Egalitarianism|journal=Political Theory|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=15|issue=3|pages=411–423|doi=10.1177/0090591787015003008|jstor=191211|s2cid=143748543}}</ref>
