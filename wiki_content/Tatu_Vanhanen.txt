'''Tatu Vanhanen''' (17 April 1929 – 22 August 2015) was a Finnish political scientist, sociologist, and writer. He was a professor of [[political science]] at the [[University of Tampere]] in [[Tampere]], [[Finland]]. Vanhanen was a coauthor with [[Richard Lynn]] of ''[[IQ and the Wealth of Nations]]'' (2002) and ''[[IQ and Global Inequality]]'' (2006), and author of ''Ethnic Conflicts Explained by Ethnic Nepotism'' (1999) and many other works.

Vanhanen developed an interest in [[evolutionary biology]] after studying [[E. O. Wilson]]'s [[sociobiology]] and later in his career wrote about intelligence and inequality. He supported applying evolutionary and [[genetics|genetic]] methods to social sciences.<ref name="HS obituary" /> However, most of his academic work dealt with [[democracy|democratization]], which he had studied with international comparative methods. Vanhanen was known for his Index of Democratization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Döbel|first=Ulrike|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724263048|title=Tatu Vanhanens 'Index of Democratization' als Beispiel einer Demokratiemessung|date=2010|isbn=978-3-640-53094-6|location=München|oclc=724263048}}</ref>

In 2004, the Ombudsman of Minorities, Mikko Puumalainen, asked the police to start an investigation regarding Vanhanen's interview with a [[Helsingin Sanomat]] magazine ''Kuukausiliite'', in which he stated that "Whereas the average IQ of Finns is 97, in Africa it is between 60 and 70. Differences in intelligence are the most significant factor in explaining poverty".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1076153484261 |title=Comments in interview could bring charges of inciting racism against PM Vanhanen's father |date=August 12, 2004 |website=Helsingin Sanomat |access-date=July 19, 2014}}</ref> The [[National Bureau of Investigation (Finland)|Finnish National Bureau of Investigations]] was considering launching a preliminary investigation on Vanhanen's speech but later decided against it, not finding that he had [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred#Finland|incited hatred against an ethnic group]] or committed any other crime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poliisi.fi/poliisi/krp/home.nsf/PFBD/2465D0FDFBE86B05C2256EEE0048566C?opendocument |title=KRP ei aloita esitutkintaa Vanhasen lausunnoista |language=fi |date=August 18, 2004 |website=National Bureau of Investigation |access-date=July 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726014558/http://www.poliisi.fi/poliisi/krp/home.nsf/PFBD/2465D0FDFBE86B05C2256EEE0048566C?opendocument |archive-date=July 26, 2014 }}</ref>
