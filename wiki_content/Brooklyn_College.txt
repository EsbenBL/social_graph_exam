'''Brooklyn College''' is a [[public university]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]. It is part of the [[City University of New York]] system and enrolls about 15,000 undergraduate and 2,800 graduate students on a 35-acre campus.

Being New York City's first public coeducational [[liberal arts college]], it was formed in 1930 by the merger of the Brooklyn branches of [[Hunter College]], then a [[women's college]], and of the [[City College of New York]], then a [[men's college]], both established in 1926. Initially tuition-free, Brooklyn College suffered in New York City government's near bankruptcy in 1975, when the college closed its campus in downtown Brooklyn. During 1976, with its [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]] campus intact and newly its only campus, Brooklyn College charged tuition for the first time.

[[City University of New York|The college's university system]] has been nicknamed "the poor man's Harvard."<ref>Abby Jackson, [https://www.businessinsider.com/cuny-severe-financial-problems-2016-5 "The college known as 'the poor man's Harvard' is facing severe budgetary issues"], ''[[Business Insider]]'', 29 May 2016.</ref> Prominent alumni of Brooklyn College include US Senators, federal judges, US financial chairpersons, Olympians, CEOs, and recipients of [[Academy Award]]s, [[Emmy Award]]s, [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, and [[Nobel Prize]]s.

[[File:2016 Brooklyn College Library.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Brooklyn College Library, situated on the East Quad, designed by original architect Randolph Evans]]
In 1932, [[architect]] Randolph Evans drafted a plan for the campus on a substantial plot that his employer owned in Brooklyn's [[Midwood]] section. Evans sketched a [[Georgian Architecture|Georgian]] campus facing a central [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], and anchored by a library building with a tower.  Evans presented the sketches to the college's then president, Dr. [[William Boylan|William A. Boylan]], who approved the layout.

The land was bought for $1.6 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1600000|1932|r=-5}}}} today), and construction allotment was $5 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000000|1932|r=-6}}}} today).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/history/ourhistory.php |title=Our History &#124; Brooklyn College |publisher=Brooklyn.cuny.edu |access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> Construction began in 1935. At the groundbreaking ceremony was [[Mayor]] [[Fiorello La Guardia]] and Brooklyn [[Borough President]] Raymond Ingersoll.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In 1936, United States President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] visited and laid the gymnasium's [[cornerstone]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Boylan, Ingersoll, and Roosevelt each became namesake of a campus building.

During the tenure of its second president, [[Harry Gideonse]], from 1939 to 1966, Brooklyn College ranked high nationally in number of alumni with doctorate degrees.<ref name="auto10">{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-03-15-8501140946-story.html|title=HARRY D.

===Modern history===
Brooklyn College's campus leafy East Quad looks much like it did when it was originally constructed.<ref name="google1"/> The campus also serves as home to BCBC/ Brooklyn College Presents complex and its four theaters, including the [[George Gershwin Theatre (Brooklyn)|George Gershwin]].

The demolition of Gershwin Hall, replaced by The Leonard & Claire Tow Center for the Performing Arts for which ground was broken in 2011, is the most recent construction on an evolving campus.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2011/05/14/new-performing-arts-center-for-brooklyn-college/|title=New performing arts center for Brooklyn College|last=Calder|first=Rich|date=May 14, 2011|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|access-date=September 5, 2016}}</ref> Alumni Leonard and Claire Tow gifted $10 million to the college.<ref name="google1"/> Other changes to the original design include the demolition of Plaza Building, due to its inefficient use of space, poor ventilation, and significant maintenance costs. To replace the Plaza Building, the college constructed West Quad Center, designed by the notable [[Uruguay]]an architect [[Rafael Viñoly]]. The new building contains classroom space, offices, gymnasiums and a swimming pool. It houses the offices of Registration, Admissions, Financial Aid, and the Department of [[Physical Education]] and Exercise Science. The grounds contain a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with grassy areas and trees. New [[façade]]s are being constructed on Roosevelt and James halls where they once connected with Plaza Building. The 2009–10 [[City University of New York Athletic Conference|CUNYAC]] championship men's basketball team now plays its home games in the West Quad Center.

This followed a major $70 million library renovation completed in 2003 that saw the library moved to a temporary home while construction took place.<ref name="google1"/> The Brooklyn College library is now located in its original location in a completely renovated and expanded LaGuardia Hall.

From 2000 to 2009 when he retired, [[Christoph M. Kimmich]] was the eighth President of Brooklyn College.<ref>Richardson, Clem.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate curriculum===
Beginning in 1981, the college instituted a group of classes that all undergraduates were required to take, called "Core Studies".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The classes were: Classical Origins of Western Culture, Introduction to Art, Introduction to Music, People, Power, and Politics, The Shaping of the Modern World, Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning and Computer Programming, Landmarks of Literature, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Geology, Studies in African, Asian, and Latin American Cultures, and Knowledge, Existence and Values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/CoreStudies.html |title=Old Core Curriculum |website=Brooklyn College |access-date=July 21, 2011}}</ref>

In 2006, the Core Curriculum was revamped, and the 13 required courses were replaced with 15 courses in 3 disciplines, from which students were required to take 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/portal/core/index.html |title=New Core Curriculum |website=Brooklyn College|date=February 6, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2011}}</ref> In the fall of 2013, Brooklyn College embarked on CUNY's new general education alternative, the Pathways curriculum, consisting of three components: Required Core (four courses), Flexible Core (six courses) and College Option (four courses)—totaling 42 credits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/general/pathways.php|title=Brooklyn College – Pathways|website=Brooklyn College|access-date=21 March 2015}}</ref>  Brooklyn College offers over a hundred majors varying from the visual arts to Women's Studies.<ref>[http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/programs/index.jsp?div=U "Undergraduate Programs and Advisors"] ''Brooklyn College''</ref>

===Division of Graduate Studies===
The Division of Graduate Studies at Brooklyn College was established in 1935 and offers more than seventy programs in the arts, education, humanities, sciences, and computer and social sciences. Among those programs is the Graduate theatre program, which is the top ranked in the CUNY system and 14th in the United States; faculty include [[Tony Award]] nominee Justin Townsend.<ref>[http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/theater/people_faculty_townsend_justin.html "Justin Townsend"] Brooklyn College website</ref><ref>[http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/search/results.html?query=Justin+Townsend "Justin Townsend"] [[Tony Award]] Nominees</ref>

===B.A.–M.D. program===
The Brooklyn College [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]]–[[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] program is an 8-year program affiliated with [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center]]. The program follows a rigorous selection process, with a maximum of 15 students selected every year. Each student selected to the program receives a Brooklyn College Presidential Scholarship. B.A.–M.D. students must engage in [[community service]] for three years, beginning in their lower sophomore semester. During one summer of their undergraduate studies, students are required to volunteer in a clinical setting where they are involved in direct [[patient care]]. B.A.–M.D. students are encouraged to major in the [[humanities]] or [[social sciences]].<ref name="bamd">{{cite web |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bamd/GenInfo.html |title=General Information |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2018 |website=B.A.-M.D. Program |publisher=Brooklyn College |access-date=February 19, 2018 }}</ref>

===The Scholars Program===
The Scholars Program is home to a small number of students with strong writing ability and academic record. Being the oldest honors program in the [[CUNY]] system, The Scholars Program has served as a model for many other honors programs nationwide. It was established in 1960 and is an interdisciplinary liberal arts program. The program offers honors-level Core courses and seminars as well as small, personalized classes. Upon graduation from Brooklyn College, many Scholars continue their education in competitive programs at top-ranked universities like Princeton, Yale, and New York University. The program accepts incoming freshmen in addition to matriculated sophomores and transfer students (up to 48 credits). Once admitted, they receive a Brooklyn College Foundation Presidential Scholarship of up to $4,000 for every year of their undergraduate study at Brooklyn College and a laptop computer.

===Coordinated Engineering Program===
The Coordinated Honors Engineering Program offers a course of study equivalent to the first two years at any engineering school. Students who maintain the required academic level are guaranteed transfer to one of the three coordinating schools—NYU-Poly, City College of New York School of Engineering, and the College of Staten Island Engineering Science Program—to complete their bachelor's degree in engineering. Coordinating Engineering students have also transferred to [[Stony Brook University]], University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, Cooper Union, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Students admitted as incoming First-Year receive a Brooklyn College Foundation Presidential Scholarship that provides full tuition for their two years of full-time undergraduate study in the Coordinated Engineering Program. As members of the Honors Academy, Engineering Honors students take advantage of individual advising, faculty consultation, and early registration. In the Commons they find study facilities, computer access, academic, scholarship, internship, and career opportunities, and, above all, intellectual stimulation among other talented students like themselves. Students applying to the Engineering Honors Program will also be considered for the Scholars Program.<ref>[http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/pub/engineering.htm Engineering] ''Brooklyn College'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912221247/http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/pub/engineering.htm |date=September 12, 2008 }}</ref>
