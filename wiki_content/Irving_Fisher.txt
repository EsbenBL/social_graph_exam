==Biography==
Fisher was born in [[Saugerties (village), New York|Saugerties, New York]]. His father was a teacher and a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister, who raised his son to believe he must be a useful member of society. Despite being raised in religious family, he later on became an [[Atheism|atheist]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Economics of Prohibition |year=2007 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |isbn=9781610160476 |author=Mark Thornton |page=16 |quote=Fisher's atheism would appear to place him at odds with religious reformers, the principal supporters of prohibition. Still, though Fisher gave up belief in God and religion, he remained convinced of the doctrines and methods of postmillennialist evangelical Protestantism.}}</ref> As a child, he had remarkable mathematical ability and a flair for invention. A week after he was admitted to [[Yale University|Yale College]] his father died, at age 53. Irving then supported his mother, brother, and himself, mainly by tutoring. He graduated first in his class with a B.A degree in 1888, having also been elected as a member of the [[Skull and Bones]] society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1925_1952/1946-47.pdf |title=Obituary record of graduates deceased during the year ending July 1, 1947 |publisher=Yale University |year=1948 |access-date=April 20, 2011}}</ref>{{rp|14}}

In 1891, Fisher received the first [[Ph.D.]] in economics granted by Yale.<ref>Shiller, Robert (2011). "[http://www.econ.yale.edu/alumni/conf2011/shiller-presentation.pdf The Yale Tradition in Macroeconomics], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913092424/http://www.econ.yale.edu/alumni/conf2011/shiller-presentation.pdf |date=2011-09-13 }}" (pg. 31). Economic Alumni Conference.</ref> His faculty advisors were the theoretical physicist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]] and the sociologist [[William Graham Sumner]]. As a student, Fisher had shown particular talent and inclination for mathematics, but he found that economics offered greater scope for his ambition and social concerns. His thesis, published by Yale in 1892 as ''Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices'', was a rigorous development of the [[general equilibrium theory|theory of general equilibrium]]. When he began writing the thesis, Fisher had not been aware that [[Léon Walras]] and his continental European disciples had already covered similar ground. Nonetheless, Fisher's work was a very significant contribution and was immediately recognized and praised as first-rate by such European masters as [[Francis Edgeworth]].

After graduating from Yale, Fisher studied in Berlin and Paris. From 1890 onward, he remained at Yale, first as a tutor, then after 1898 as a professor of political economy, and after 1935 as professor emeritus. He edited the ''Yale Review'' from 1896 to 1910 and was active in many learned societies, institutes, and welfare organizations. He was president of the [[American Economic Association]] in 1918. The [[American Mathematical Society]] selected him as its Gibbs Lecturer for 1929.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fisher, Irving |title=The application of mathematics to the social sciences |journal=Bull.

He made several practical inventions, the most notable of which was an "index visible filing system" which he patented in 1913<ref name="Patent">{{US patent|1048058}}</ref> and sold to Kardex Rand (later [[Remington Rand]]) in 1925.

==Economic theories==

=== Utility theory ===
[[James Tobin]], writing on the contributions of [[John Bates Clark]] and Irving Fisher to neoclassical theory in America<ref>{{cite journal| last=Tobin| first=James |title=Neoclassical Theory in America: J. B. Clark and Fisher |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=75 | pages=28–38 |year=1985 | issue=6}}</ref>  argues that American economists contributed in their own way to the preparation of a common ground after the neoclassical revolution. In particular Clark and Irving Fisher “brought neoclassical theory into American journals, classrooms, and textbooks, and its analytical tools into the kits of researchers and practitioners.” Already in his doctoral thesis, “Fisher expounds thoroughly the mathematics of utility functions and their maximization, and he is careful to allow for corner solutions.” Already then, Fisher “states clearly that neither interpersonally comparable utility nor cardinal utility for each individual is necessary to the determination of equilibrium."

In reviewing the history of [[utility]] theory, economist [[George Stigler]] wrote that Fisher's doctoral thesis had been "brilliant" and stressed that it contained "the first careful examination of the measurability of the utility function and its relevance to demand theory."<ref name="Stigler-II" />  While his published work exhibited an unusual degree of mathematical sophistication for an economist of his day, Fisher always sought to bring his analysis to life and to present his theories as lucidly as possible.  For instance, to complement the arguments in his doctoral thesis, he built an elaborate hydraulic machine with pumps and levers, allowing him to demonstrate visually how the equilibrium prices in the market adjusted in response to changes in supply or demand.

===Interest and capital===
[[File:Fisher - Theory of interest as determined by impatience to spend income and opportunity to invest it, 1930 - 5800257.tif|thumb|''Theory of interest as determined by impatience to spend income and opportunity to invest it'', 1930]]
Fisher is probably best remembered today in neoclassical economics for his theory of [[capital (economics)|capital]], [[investment]], and [[interest rates]], first exposited in his ''The Nature of Capital and Income'' (1906) and elaborated on in ''The Rate of Interest'' (1907). His 1930 treatise, ''The Theory of Interest'', summed up a lifetime's research into capital, [[capital budgeting]], [[credit market]]s, and the factors (including [[inflation]]) that determine interest rates.

Fisher saw that subjective economic value is not only a function of the amount of goods and services owned or exchanged, but also of the moment in time when they are purchased with money. A good available now has a different value than the same good available at a later date; value has a time as well as a quantity dimension. The [[relative price]] of goods available at a future date, in terms of goods sacrificed now, is measured by the [[interest rate]]. Fisher made free use of the standard diagrams used to teach undergraduate economics, but labeled the axes "consumption now" and "consumption next period" (instead of the usual schematic alternatives of [[Apples and oranges|"apples" and "oranges"]]). The resulting theory, one of considerable power and insight, was presented in detail in ''The Theory of Interest''.<ref>For a concise exposition see [https://web.archive.org/web/20080429203224/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/fisherinvest.htm cepa.newschool.edu].</ref>

This model, later generalized to the case of ''K'' goods and ''N'' periods (including the case of infinitely many periods) has become a standard theory of capital and interest, and is described in Gravelle and Rees,<ref name="Gravelle">Gravelle, H., and Rees, R., 2004. ''Microeconomics'', 3rd ed. Pearson Education, ch. 11.</ref> and Aliprantis, Brown, and Burkinshaw.<ref name="Aliprantis">{{cite book |last1=Aliprantis |first1=Charalambos D. |author-link1=Charalambos D.

Fisher saw that the economic policy of what he did for his theory for was something that was making an impact on society as a whole. He was seen as the “greatest American economist of his time”, taking the skills of what he learned in mathematics and decided to incorporate it into economics for the greater good of the field of study. Once he brought out his Quantity Theory of Money, it started to take economic models and bring more of a life to them in the aspects of the mathematics included with it. With addressing models have the different axes labeled, there has been so much that he has contributed to the economic world. One of the strongest points that Fisher brings out in discussing interest rates was the power of impatience and time. When examining how a certain item can be valued during a point of time, then seeing how much it is in a different time, justified by interest, speaks out volumes of what is happening in the world. The impatience of humans with their nature of not wanting to wait for certain items speaks out to what is going in, with relations to interest rates. When an individual begins to wait, there is much that happens in relations with the interest rates. Overall, it becomes more of a monetary value that humans end up going for with not waiting for purchase something in the different period instead of the current. At the end, Fisher has left a huge impact the world on economics. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandmo |first1=Angar |title=Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought |date=2011 |publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>

===Monetary economics===
Fisher's research into the basic theory of prices and interest rates did not touch directly on the great social issues of the day. On the other hand, his [[monetary economics]] ''did'' and this grew to be the main focus of Fisher's mature work.

It was Fisher who (following the pioneering work of [[Simon Newcomb]]) formulated the [[quantity theory of money]] in terms of the "[[equation of exchange]]:" Let ''M'' be the total stock of money, ''P'' the [[price level]], ''T'' the amount of transactions carried out using money, and ''V'' the [[Velocity of money|velocity of circulation]] of money, so that

:<math>M\cdot V = P\cdot T</math>{{Citation needed|reason=statement should be supported by citation to a reliable source. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources| date=April 2021}}

Later economists replaced ''T'' by the real output ''Y'' (or ''Q''), usually quantified by the real [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP).

Fisher's ''Appreciation and Interest'' was an abstract analysis of the behavior of [[interest rate]]s when the [[price level]] is changing. It emphasized the distinction between [[real interest rate|real]] and [[nominal interest rate]]s:

:<math>r=\frac{(1+i)}{(1+\pi)}-1 \simeq i - \pi </math><ref>{{Cite web|title=Fisher Equation|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/fisher-equation/|access-date=2021-10-18|website=Corporate Finance Institute|language=en-US}}</ref>

where <math>r</math> is the real interest rate, <math>i</math> is the nominal interest rate, and the inflation <math>\pi</math> is a measure of the increase in the price level. When inflation is sufficiently low, the real interest rate can be approximated as the nominal interest rate minus the expected [[inflation rate]]. The resulting equation is known as the [[Fisher equation]] in his honor.

Fisher believed that investors and savers – people in general – were afflicted in varying degrees by "[[money illusion]]"; they could not see past the money to the goods the money could buy. In an ideal world, changes in the price level would have no effect on production or employment. In the actual world with money illusion, [[inflation]] (and deflation) did serious harm. For more than forty years, Fisher elaborated his vision of the damaging "dance of the dollar" and devised various schemes to "stabilize" money, i.e. to stabilize the price level. He was one of the first to subject [[macroeconomic]] data, including the money stock, interest rates, and the price level, to statistical analyses and tests. In the 1920s, he introduced the technique later called [[distributed lag]]s. In 1973, the ''Journal of Political Economy'' posthumously reprinted his 1926 paper on the statistical relation between [[unemployment]] and [[inflation]], retitling it as "I discovered the [[Phillips curve]]". [[Price index|Index numbers]] played an important role in his monetary theory, and his book ''The Making of Index Numbers'' has remained influential down to the present day.{{Citation needed|reason=statement should be supported by citation to a reliable source. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources| date=April 2021}}

Fisher's main intellectual rival was the Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]]. Fisher espoused a more succinct explanation of the quantity theory of money, resting it almost exclusively on long run prices. Wicksell's theory was considerably more complicated, beginning with interest rates in a system of changes in the real economy. Although both economists concluded from their theories that at the heart of the business cycle (and economic crisis) was government monetary policy, their disagreement would not be solved in their lifetimes, and indeed, it was inherited by the policy debates between the Keynesians and monetarists beginning a half-century later.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Humphrey |first1=Thomas M. |title=Fisher and Wicksell on the Quantity Theory - Economic Quarterly, Fall 1997 - Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond |url=https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/1997/fall/humphrey |website=www.richmondfed.org|access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref>

===Debt-deflation===
{{further|Debt deflation}}
Following the stock market crash of 1929, and in light of the ensuing [[Great Depression]], Fisher developed a theory of [[economic crises]] called [[debt-deflation]], which attributed the crises to the bursting of a [[credit bubble]]. Initially, during the upswing over-confident economic agents are lured by the prospect of high profits to increase their debt in order to leverage their gains. According to Fisher, once the credit bubble bursts, this unleashes a series of effects that have serious negative impact on the real economy:
# Debt liquidation and distress selling.
# Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off.
# A fall in the level of asset prices.
# A still greater fall in the net worth of businesses, precipitating bankruptcies.
# A fall in profits.
# A reduction in output, in trade and in employment.
# Pessimism and loss of confidence.
# Hoarding of money.
# A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation-adjusted interest rates.

Crucially, as debtors try to liquidate or pay off their nominal debt, the fall of prices caused by this defeats the very attempt to reduce the real burden of debt. Thus, while repayment reduces the amount of money owed, this does not happen fast enough since the real value of the dollar now rises ('swelling of the dollar').<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=Irving |title=The debt-deflation theory of great depressions |journal=Econometrica |date=1933 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=337–357|doi=10.2307/1907327 |jstor=1907327 | url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/3596 |via=[[FRASER]]}}</ref>

This theory was largely ignored in favor of [[Keynesian economics]], in part because of the damage to Fisher's reputation caused by his public optimism about the stock market, just prior to the crash. Debt-deflation has experienced a [[Debt deflation#Mainstream interest|revival of mainstream interest]] since the 1980s, and particularly with the [[Late-2000s recession]]. [[Steve Keen]] predicted the 2008 recession by using [[Hyman Minsky]]'s further development of Fisher's work on debt-deflation. Debt-deflation is now the major theory with which Fisher's name is associated.<ref name="shadow" />

==Stock market crash of 1929==
The stock market [[crash of 1929]] and the subsequent [[Great Depression]] cost Fisher much of his personal wealth and academic reputation. He famously predicted, nine days before the crash, that stock prices had "reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."<ref>{{Cite news|title=FISHER SEES STOCKS PERMANENTLY HIGH; Yale Economist Tells Purchasing Agents Increased Earnings Justify Rise. SAYS TRUSTS AID SALES Finds Special Knowledge, Applied to Diversify Holdings, Shifts Risks for Clients.|date=October 16, 1929|work=New York Times|page=8|id = {{ProQuest|104696595}}}}</ref> Irving Fisher stated on October 21 that the market was "only shaking out of the lunatic fringe" and went on to explain why he felt the prices still had not caught up with their real value and should go much higher. On Wednesday, October 23, he announced in a banker's meeting "security values in most instances were not inflated." For months after the Crash, he continued to assure investors that a recovery was just around the corner. Once the [[Great Depression]] was in full force, he did warn that the ongoing drastic [[deflation (economics)|deflation]] was the cause of the disastrous cascading insolvencies then plaguing the American economy because deflation increased the real value of debts fixed in dollar terms. Fisher was so discredited by his 1929 pronouncements and by the failure of a firm he had started that few people took notice of his "debt-deflation" analysis of the Depression. People instead eagerly turned to the ideas of [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]. Fisher's debt-deflation scenario has since seen a revival since the 1980s.

Fisher's 1942 book with the concept behind the [[USA Tax|Unlimited Savings Accumulation Tax]], a reform introduced in the United States Senate in 1995 by Senator Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico), former Senator Sam Nunn (D-Georgia), and Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Nebraska). The concept was that unnecessary spending (which is hard to define in a law) can be taxed by taxing income minus all net investments and savings, and minus an allowance for essential purchases, thus making funds available for investment.

== Social and health campaigns ==
In 1898, Fisher was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], the same disease that had killed his father.  He spent three years in sanatoria, finally making a full recovery.  That experience sparked in him a vocation as a health campaigner.  He was one of the founders of the [[Life Extension Institute]], under whose auspices he co-authored the bestselling book ''How to Live: Rules for Healthful Living Based on Modern Science'', published in 1915.  He advocated regular exercise and the avoidance of [[red meat]], [[tobacco]], and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].  In 1924, Fisher wrote an [[anti-smoking]] article for the ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', which argued that "tobacco lowers the whole tone of the body and decreases its vital power and resistance ... [it] acts like a narcotic poison, like opium and like alcohol, though usually in a less degree".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/fgo81c00/pdf;jsessionid=512902F957843008C40E997C9D0B9A6C.tobacco03 |title=Does tobacco injure the human body? |author=Irving Fisher |date=1924 |work=Readers Digest |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418233913/http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/fgo81c00/pdf%3Bjsessionid%3D512902F957843008C40E997C9D0B9A6C.tobacco03 |archive-date=2014-04-18 }}</ref>

Fisher supported the legal [[prohibition]] of alcohol and wrote three booklets defending [[prohibition in the United States]] on grounds of public health and economic productivity.<ref>Irving Fisher, Prohibition at Its Worst (New York: Macmillan, 1926); Prohibition Still at Its Worst (New York: Alcohol Information Committee, 1928); The Noble Experiment (New York:  Alcohol Information Committee, 1930).</ref>  As a proponent of Eugenics he helped found the [[Race Betterment Foundation]] in 1906.  He also defended [[eugenics]], serving in the scientific advisory board of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] and as first president of the [[American Eugenics Society]].<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | isbn = 9780275979324 | last = Engs | first = Ruth C.  | title = The Progressive Era's Health Reform Movement: A Historical Dictionary | page = 121 | date = 2003 }}</ref>

When his daughter Margaret was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], Fisher had her treated at the [[Trenton Psychiatric Hospital|New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton]], whose director was the psychiatrist [[Henry Cotton (doctor)|Henry Cotton]].  Cotton believed in a "focal [[sepsis]]" theory, according to which [[mental illness]] resulted from infectious material in the roots of teeth, bowel recesses, and other places in the body.  Cotton also claimed that surgical removal of the infected tissue could alleviate the patient's mental disorder.  At Trenton, Margaret Fisher had sections of her [[bowel]] and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] removed, which eventually resulted in her death.  Irving Fisher nonetheless remained convinced of the validity of Cotton's treatment.<ref>''[[Madhouse: A Tragic Tale of Megalomania and Modern Medicine]]'', Andrew Scull, Yale University Press, 2005</ref>
