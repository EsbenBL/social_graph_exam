== Research==

Marianne Bertrand's research interests include [[labour economics]], [[corporate governance]] and [[development economics]]. In most of her research she uses [[economic experiments]], often in collaboration with her frequent co-author [[Sendhil Mullainathan]]. According to [[IDEAS/RePEc]], Bertrand ranked in September 2018 157th in terms of research among 54 233 registered economists (i.e., among the top 0.3%)<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html Top 10% Authors]. Retrieved November 4, 2018.</ref> and 5th among 10 406 female economists (among the top 0.05%)<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.women.html Top 10% female economists]. Retrieved November 4, 2018.</ref>

=== Research on labour economics, discrimination and gender gaps===

One key area of Bertrand's research is [[labour economics]], in particular racial and gender discrimination. Together with [[Sendhil Mullainathan]], she finds that the introduction of antitakeover legislation, which shield companies somewhat from competition, in the 1980s raised wages  by 1–2%, thus suggesting that managers have some discretion in wage setting.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2556062 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (1999). Is there discretion in wage setting? A test using takeover legislation. ''Rand Journal of Economics'', 30(3), pp. 535–554.]</ref> In a seminal contribution to research on racial labour market discrimination, Bertrand and Mullainathan manipulate perceived race on fictitious resumes sent in reply to help-wanted ads by using Afro-American- or Caucasian-sounding names and observe that "white names" receive 50% more callbacks for interviews, a finding that holds robustly across occupations, industries, firm sizes and controls for social class.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2004). Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A field experiment on labor market discrimination. ''American Economic Review'', 94(4), pp. 991–1013.]</ref> Relatedly, Bertrand, Mullainathan and Dolly Chugh have argued for the existence of ''implicit discrimination'', which – unlike [[taste-based discrimination|taste-based]] or [[statistical discrimination (economics)|statistical discrimination]] – is unintentional and of which the discriminator is unaware.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282805774670365 Bertrand, M., Chugh, D., Mullainathan, S. (2005). Implicit discrimination. ''American Economic Review'', 95(2), pp. 94–98.]</ref> In another exploration of racial discrimination, Bertrand, Mullainathan and David Abrams find that judges in [[Illinois]] vary in the degree to which race influences their sentencing, with smaller gaps between white and [[African Americans|Afro-American]] incarceration rates for Afro-American judges and judges passing comparatively many incarceration sentences also being disproportionately likely to sentence Afro-Americans to jail.<ref>[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/666006 Abrams, D.S., Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2012). Do judges vary in their treatment of race? ''Journal of Legal Studies'', 41(2), pp. 347–383.]</ref>

Studying the impact of entry regulation on job creation in [[France]] with [[Francis Kramarz]], Bertrand finds that regional zoning boards' tendency to deter the creation or extension of retail stores increased retailer concentration and slowed down employment growth.<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/117/4/1369/1875976 Bertrand, M., Kramarz, F. (2002). Does entry regulation hinder job creation? Evidence from the French retail industry. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 117(4), pp. 1369–1413.]</ref> In another study of the impact of [[Intra-industry trade|infra-industry]] competition on wages, Bertrand finds that growth in import competition makes workers' wages more sensitive to the current unemployment rate and less sensitive to the unemployment rate that prevailed at the time they were hired, thus suggesting that import competition may erode the implicit contracts between employers and their employees.<ref>[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/423153 Bertrand, M. (2004). From the invisible handshake to the invisible hand? How import competition changes the employment relationship. ''Journal of Labor Economics'', 22(4), pp. 723–765.]</ref>

Analysing the gender gap with Kevin Hallock, Bertrand observes that in 1992–97 only 2.5% of top executives in US firms were women and that they earned on average 45% less than men, with up to 75% of that gap being explained by differences in the size of the managed firms and women's lower likelihood to be [[CEO]], Chair or President, though she also finds that female participation in top executive positions nearly tripled during that period; nonetheless, Bertrand and Hallock stress that gender discrimination via segregation or unequal promotion cannot be ruled out.<ref>[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979390105500101 Bertrand, M., Hallock, K.F. (2001). The gender gap in top corporate jobs. ''ILR Review'', 55(1), pp. 3–21.]</ref> Further exploring the issue of gender pay gaps with [[Claudia Goldin]] and [[Lawrence F. Katz]], Bertrand finds that although the earnings of male and female [[MBA]]s are nearly identical at the beginning of their careers, ten years later, male earnings are almost 60 log points higher, with most of the gap being explained by differences in pre-MBA training, career interruptions and weekly hours, the latter two being mostly due to motherhood.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.3.228 Bertrand, M., Goldin, C., Katz, L.F. (2010). Dynamics of the gender gap for young professionals in the financial and corporate sectors. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'', 2(3), pp. 228–255.]</ref> Another major contribution to the role of gender in the [[Labor market|labour marke]]<nowiki/>t is Bertrand's 2011 chapter in the ''Handbook of Labor Economics'', which reviews the potential of psychological and socio-psychological factors in explaining gender differences in labour market outcomes.<ref>Bertrand, M. (2011). New perspectives on gender. In: Card, D., Ashenfelter, O. (eds.). ''Handbook of Labor Economics'', vol. 4. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 1543–1590.</ref> More recently, in research with Emir Kamenica and Jessica Pan, Bertrand has found that the distribution of wives' share of household income drops sharply just after 50%, which she attributes to gender norms averse to the husband earning less than his wife, a norm that in turn affects the formation of marriages, wives' labour force participation and their income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, divorce rates, and the division of household chores.<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/130/2/571/2330321 Bertrand, M., Kamenica, E., Pan, J. (2015). Gender identity and relative income within households. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 130(2), pp. 571–614.]</ref> Relatedly, Bertrand and Pan have also explored the gender gap in disruptive behaviour, finding that boys' propensity to disruptive behaviour – unlike girls' – seems to be extremely responsive to parental inputs, which are substantially worse in broken families, whereas early school environment has little impact.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.5.1.32 Bertrand, M., Pan, J. (2013). The trouble with boys: Social influences and the gender gap in disruptive behavior. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'', 5(1), pp. 32–64.]</ref>

Another interesting research pertaining to gender gap is about effect of board quotas on female labor force in Norway. She found that after Norway passed the law to have at least 40% women representation in board meetings, there were no  significant impact to the larger population of women in the country. They found that this bill benefited young business graduates who were women the most. The overall conclusion after seven years was that this law had minimum impact on the larger society of the women, expect for the ones who were actually in the board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/b/marianne-bertrand|title=Marianne Bertrand|website=The University of Chicago Booth School of Business|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> 

=== Research on corporate governance, family firms and finance===

Another major area of Bertrand's research is [[corporate governance]]. Together with Mullainathan, Bertrand has researched the determinants of CEO pay, contrasting the ''contracting view'' – shareholders set CEO contracts in such a way as to limit [[moral hazard]] – with the ''skimming view'' – CEOs set their own pay by manipulation the compensation committee to skim as much as possible.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.90.2.203 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2000). Agents with and without principals. ''American Economic Review'', 90(2), pp. 203–208.]</ref> In line with the ''skimming view'', they find that CEO pay responds just as much to luck – shocks to the firm performance that are objectively beyond their control – as to developments over which they have control, with the sensitivity to luck being generally higher in firms with poor corporate governance.<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/116/3/901/1899775 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2001). Are CEOs rewarded for luck? The ones without principals are. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 116(3), pp. 901–932.]</ref> Moreover, Bertrand and Mullainathan find that the more managers' firms are sheltered from competition, e.g. antitakeover laws, the more wages rise and productivity and profitability fall, possibly due to decreases in the destruction of old and the creation of new plants, suggesting that managers may prefer stability to empire building.<ref>[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/376950 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2003). Enjoying the quiet life? Corporate governance and managerial preferences. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 111(5), pp. 1043–1075.]</ref> Together with [[Antoinette Schoar]], Bertrand has investigated the effect of managers on firm policies in the U.S., finding that a large share of differences between firms' investment, financial, and organizational practices are due to differences in their managers and, more importantly, their management style, with older managers generally being more conservative and managers with MBA degrees being generally more aggressive in terms of corporate decisions.<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/118/4/1169/1925095 Bertrand, M., Schoar, A. (2003). Managing with style: The effect of managers on firm policies. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 118(4), pp. 1169–1208.]</ref> In work with Schoar and [[David Thesmar]], Bertrand observes that after the deregulation of banking in France in 1985, banks became less willing to bail out firms with poor performance and firms being more dependent on banks became more likely to restructure, with rising rates of job and asset reallocation, higher allocative efficiency, and a less concentrated banking sector, an observation in line with [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeterian]] processes of [[creative destruction]].<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01218.x Bertrand, M., Schoar, A., Thesmar, D. (2007). Banking deregulation and industry structure: Evidence from the French banking reforms of 1985. ''Journal of Finance'', 62(2), pp. 597–628.]</ref> Finally, together with Adair Morse, Bertrand succeeds in decreasing the take-up of highly costly payday loans by 11% over a four-month period by making borrowers think about the dollar fees accruing due to the loans' roll-over, suggesting a role for information disclosure policies to remedy payday borrowing.<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01698.x Bertrand, M., Morse, A. (2011). Information disclosure, cognitive biases, and payday borrowing. ''Journal of Finance'', 66(6), pp. 1865–1893.]</ref>

Bertrand and Schoar have also conducted research on the role of family for [[family enterprise]]s, finding that family values tend to be associated with lower economic development – though differently than [[trust (emotion)|trust]] – and more family firms, are fairly stable over time, don't react much to economic changes, and don't appear to reflect weak formal institutions.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.20.2.73 Bertrand, M., Schoar, A. (2006). The role of family in family firms. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 20(2), pp. 73–96.]</ref> In further research on this topic in [[Thailand]] with [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and Krislert Samphantharak, Bertrand and Schoar find family involvement in the ownership of family businesses to increase in family size, though firm performance decreases the more the founders' sons become involved, possibly because of a "race to the bottom" wherein, fearing the dilution of ownership and control over the business group, the descendants attempt to tunnel resources out of the group's firms.<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X08000755 Bertrand, M. et al. (2008). Mixing family with business: A study of Thai business groups and the families behind them. ''Journal of Financial Economics'', 88(3), pp. 466–498.]</ref> These results are matched by Bertrand and Mullainathan's earlier research on business groups in [[India]], which also finds significant amounts of tunneling, especially via nonoperating components of profit.<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/117/1/121/1851754 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2002). Ferreting out tunneling: An application to Indian business groups. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 117(1), pp. 121–148.]</ref>

=== Research on development economics===

A third area of Bertrand's research concerns [[development economics]]. One of Bertrand's most important contributions to this area is the development (together with Mullainathan and [[Eldar Shafir]]) of a view on [[poverty]] that emphasizes neither the role of a [[culture of poverty]] or of significant differences between the psychology and attitudes of poor and rich people, but rather highlights that the economic consequences of common biases are disproportionately large for poor people precisely because they are poor and thus have little margin for errors.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041302019 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., Shafir, E. (2004). A behavioral-economics view of poverty. ''American Economic Review'', 94(2), pp. 419–423.]</ref> They thus argue for the use of insights from [[Behavioral economics|behavioural economics]] and marketing to help poor people make decisions, e.g. by making participation in programs aimed at the poor simple and by investing into the marketing of these programs to increase their outreach.<ref>[http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jppm.25.1.8 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., Shafir, E. (2006). Behavioral economics and marketing in aid of decision making among the poor. ''Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 25(1), pp. 8–23.]</ref> With Mullainathan and Douglas Miller, Bertrand has also studied the allocation of resources within extended families in the wake of [[South Africa]]'s pension program, finding the labour supply of prime-age individuals to drop sharply when elderly household members become eligible for pensions, with the drop being larger if the pensioner is a woman, if the non-pensioners are themselves old, and if they are male, the drop being largest for the oldest son than for any other prime-age household member.<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/wber/article-abstract/17/1/27/1676295 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., Miller, D. (2003). Public policy and extended families: Evidence from pensions in South Africa. ''World Bank Economic Review'', 17(1), pp. 27–50.]</ref> In India, Bertrand, Mullainathan, [[Simeon Djankov]] and [[Rema Hanna]] study corruption using the allocation of driver's licenses and find that the illegal obtention of licenses is mostly performed by using private intermediaries to give bribes so that they may not have to pass the driving test.<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/122/4/1639/1850513 Bertrand, M. et al. (2007). Obtaining a driver's license in India: an experimental approach to studying corruption. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 122(4), pp. 1639–1676.]</ref> Finally, more recently, Bertrand has been involved in the evaluation of [[conditional cash transfer]] programs, e.g. finding that the postponement of transfers to parents until re-enrollment and the incentivization of graduation and tertiary enrollment both increase enrollment rates at the secondary and tertiary level.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.3.2.167 Barrera-Osorio, F. et al. (2011). Improving the design of conditional transfer programs: Evidence from a randomized education experiment in Colombia. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'', 3(2), pp. 167–195.]</ref> Another interesting research she did in the field of development economics was the marketing in aid of decision making to the poor. In this paper she studies the aspects of economic decision making on the life of the poor, and how it is influenced by effective marketing. 

=== Other research===

Other topics of Bertrand's research include [[econometrics|econometric methodology]], welfare cultures, advertising, lobbyism, and trickle-down consumption:
* Because of the correlation between measurement errors of subjective data and many personal characteristics and behaviours, subjective data don't make good [[dependent variable]]s, though they can be useful as explanatory variables (with Mullainathan).<ref>[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/aer.91.2.67 Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2001). Do people mean what they say? Implications for subjective survey data. ''American Economic Review'', 91(2), pp. 67–72.]</ref>
* The standard errors of research applying [[difference in differences]] estimation to time-series or panel data with serially correlated outcomes are likely to understate the real standard errors if such [[autocorrelation]] isn't accounted for (with Mullainathan and [[Esther Duflo]]).<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/119/1/249/1876068 Bertrand, M., Duflo, E., Mullainathan, S. (2004). How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates? ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 119(1), pp. 249–275.]</ref>
* Being surrounded by others who speak the same language increases welfare participation more for those from high welfare-using language groups (with Erzo Luttmer and Mullainathan).<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/115/3/1019/1828147 Bertrand, M., Luttmer, E.F.P., Mullainathan, S. (2000). Network effects and welfare cultures. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 115(3), pp. 1019–1055.]</ref>
* Advertising through the inclusion of a photo of an attractive woman increases demand for consumer loans, decreasing the number of example loans, or not suggesting particular uses for a loan increases loan demand by as much as a 25% reduction in the credit rate, as do longer deadlines for loan applications (with Mullainathan, Shafir, [[Dean Karlan]] and [[Jonathan Zinman]]).<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/125/1/263/1880334 Bertrand, M. et al. (2010). What's advertising content worth? Evidence from a consumer credit marketing field experiment. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 125(1), pp. 263–306.]</ref>
* Evidence on lobbyism in the US doesn't support the expertise view, wherein lobbyism provide issue-specific expertise to politicians, as sole explanation for lobbyism and instead suggests that lobbyists focus on developing a "circle of influence" within which they represent the special interests of their clients (with [[Matilde Bombardini]] and Francesco Trebbi).<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.12.3885 Bertrand, M., Bombardini, M., Trebbi, F. (2014). Is it whom you know or what you know? An empirical assessment of the lobbying process. ''American Economic Review'', 104(12), pp. 3885–3920.]</ref>
* Especially for visible goods and services, the share of non-rich households' incomes spent on consumption increases in their exposure to higher top income and consumption, suggesting a role for conspicuous consumption with regard to inequality (with Adair Morse).<ref>[https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00613 Bertrand, M., Morse, A. (2016). Trickle-down consumption. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 98(5), pp. 863–879.]</ref>
