'''Henry Fawcett''' (26 August 1833 – 6 November 1884) was a British academic, [[politician|statesman]] and economist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1038&type=P|publisher=University of Glasgow|title=Biography of Henry Fawcett|access-date=1 March 2008}}</ref>

==Background and education==
[[File:Henry fawcett cartoon.png|thumb|left|1881 Cartoon from Punch: "PROFESSOR FAWCETT, M.P and P.M.G., A Politician of a certain stamp, and President of the Republic of Letters at St. Martin-le-Grand's"]]
[[File:Henry Fawcett.jpg|thumb|Henry Fawcett]]
Henry Fawcett was born in [[Salisbury]], and educated at [[King's College School]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]: entering [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] in 1852, he migrated to [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]] the following year, and became a fellow there in 1856, the year he graduated BA as 7th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]].<ref>{{acad|id=FWCT852H|name=Fawcett, Henry}}</ref>

In 1858, when he was 25, he was [[Blindness|blinded]] in a shooting accident.  Despite his blindness, he continued with his studies, especially in economics.  He was able to enter [[Lincoln's Inn]], but decided against a career as a barrister and took his name off their books in 1860.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Blind Victorian: Henry Fawcett and British Liberalism | first=Lawrence | last=Goldman | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2003 | isbn=0-521-89274-0 | page=94}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Two years later, Henry Fawcett reportedly attended the [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]], during which he was asked whether he thought Bishop [[Samuel Wilberforce]] had actually read the ''[[Origin of Species]]''.  Reportedly, Henry Fawcett replied loudly,  "Oh no, I would swear he has never read a word of it". Ready to recriminate, Wilberforce swung round to him scowling, but stepped back and bit his tongue on noting that the speaker was the blind economist.<ref>Janet Browne, ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', 2003, p. 126.</ref>

At the next meeting (in September 1861) of the [[British Association]] in Manchester, Henry Fawcett defended the logic behind [[Charles Darwin]]'s theories.<ref>''London Illustrated News'', 16 September 1861, p. 279</ref> This significantly affected its acceptance.

In 1863, Henry Fawcett published his ''Manual of Political Economy'' and became [[Professor of Political Economy, Cambridge University|Professor of Political Economy]] at Cambridge. He made himself a recognised authority on economics, his works on which include ''The Economic Position of the British Labourer'' (1865) and ''Labour and Wages''.

In 1883, he was elected [[Rector of Glasgow University]].

==Political career==
After repeated defeats as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] candidate, Henry Fawcett was elected Member of Parliament for [[Brighton (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton]] in 1865.  He held this seat until 1874, and thereafter represented [[Hackney (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney]] between 1874 and 1884. He campaigned for [[women's suffrage]]. In 1880, he was appointed [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=24841 |date=4 May 1880 |page=2836 }}</ref>

He had a particular interest in encouraging saving through the Post Office Savings Bank. He introduced the savings stamp which allowed people to save pennies at a time to build up the minimum account limit of a shilling. He pushed through parliament an act to allow savers to convert their post office savings to government stock and he developed the post office's life insurance and annuities schemes.<ref>Archibald Grainger Bowie ''The Romance of the Savings Banks'' 1898 SW Partridge & Co</ref> He introduced many other innovations, including parcel post, postal orders, and licensing changes to permit payphones and trunk lines.

==Family==
Through his campaigning for women's [[suffrage]], Henry Fawcett met [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson|Elizabeth Garrett]], to whom he proposed in 1865. She rejected the proposal to concentrate on becoming a doctor at a time when female doctors were extremely rare.

However, in 1867 Fawcett married Elizabeth's younger sister [[Millicent Fawcett|Millicent Garrett]].<ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WfawcettM.htm Millicent Garrett Fawcett] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310085734/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WfawcettM.htm |date=10 March 2009 }} – Spartacus Educational</ref><ref>The Passing Parade with John Doremus, Evening with Ian Holland, Radio [[2CH]] 20:40 [[AEST]] 3 August 2007.</ref> They had one child, [[Philippa Fawcett]].

Henry Fawcett's career was cut short by his premature death from [[pleurisy]] in November 1884, aged 51. He is buried in Trumpington Extension Cemetery, Cambridge where several members of the family of Charles Darwin are also buried, including Sir [[George Darwin]], Lady Maud, and [[Gwen Raverat]].

==Legacy==
There are statues of him in Salisbury Market Square and in [[Victoria Embankment Gardens]] (''[[Henry Fawcett Memorial]]'') near [[Charing Cross]] in central London. The latter is by the eminent sculptor [[Mary Grant (sculptor)|Mary Grant]]. A fine statue with an angel standing over a seated Henry Fawcett (by the sculptor George Tinworth) was erected in 1893 in [[Vauxhall Park]] (opened in 1890 on this site of Fawcett's house, The Lawns) but was removed by Lambeth Council in 1959. [[Alfred Gilbert]] was commissioned to make a memorial which stands in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name="Gilbert">{{Cite ODNB|id=33398|title=Gilbert, Sir Alfred}}</ref>

Sir [[Leslie Stephen]] wrote a biography of him, ''Life of Henry Fawcett'', in 1885. He is listed amongst the important British Reformers on the "Reformers Memorial" in the centre of the eastmost oval section in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].

Fawcett Primary School in [[Trumpington]], Cambridge, was opened in 1949 and named after Henry Fawcett who lived nearby.<ref>Fawcett Primary School - About Us {{cite web |url=http://www.trumpingtonfederation.co.uk/page/?title=Our+history&pid=200 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043213/http://www.trumpingtonfederation.co.uk/page/?title=Our+history&pid=200 |archive-date=4 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There is also a Henry Fawcett primary school in London, which opened in 1937.<ref>Henry Fawcett Primary School - History {{cite web |url=http://www.henryfawcett.org.uk/history.html |title=School website |access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>

Fawcett's time as Postmaster General was fondly remembered by many postal workers, and when London sorting clerks formed a union in 1890, they named it the [[Fawcett Association]].<ref name="marsh">{{cite book |last1=Marsh |first1=Arthur |last2=Ryan |first2=Victoria |title=Historical Directory of Trade Unions |volume=1 |date=1980 |publisher=Gower |location=Farnborough |isbn=0566021609 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldirect0004mars/page/86 86] |url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldirect0004mars/page/86 }}</ref>
