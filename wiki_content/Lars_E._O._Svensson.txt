'''Lars Erik Oscar Svensson''', is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[economist]]. He was on the faculty of [[Princeton University]] 2001–2009. Since June 2014, he is Affiliated Professor at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]]. Since 2009 he is Affiliated Professor at Stockholm University. He has published significant research in [[macroeconomics]], especially [[monetary economics]], [[international trade]] and [[general equilibrium theory]]. He is among the most influential economists in the world according to [[RePEc|IDEAS/RePEc]]. He is a well-known proponent of price path targeting, a topic on which he published significant research.

During 2007–2013 he was a [[deputy governor]] of the [[Sveriges Riksbank]] (the central bank of [[Sweden]]). From 2009 he dissented and advocated a more expansionary monetary policy for Sweden, since the unemployment rate was high and inflation fell far below the Riksbank's inflation target. He is also notable for advocating a slightly [[negative interest rate]] among [[central bank]]s at the Riksbank in July 2009.<ref>{{cite news
