'''Neil Cornelius Wolverton Chamberlain''' (May 18, 1915 – September 14, 2006) was an American [[economist]] who was the [[Armand G. Erpf]] Professor of Modern Corporations of the [[Columbia Business School|Graduate School of Business]] at [[Columbia University]]. Before that he was a professor in the Department of Economics at [[Yale University]]. His scholarly efforts concerned [[industrial relations]] and [[labor economics]], the economies of corporations and [[corporate planning]], national planning, and social values and [[corporate social responsibility]].  He was the author of nineteen books, editor of six more, published numerous articles in academic journals, and wrote an intellectual memoir as well.<ref name="whalen"/>  His range of research and writing was unusually wide, but his biggest contribution to the field of economics was in the study of industrial relations and especially in his analysis of [[bargaining power]].<ref name="retro-3"/>

==Early life, education, and writing==
Chamberlain was born on May 18, 1915, in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], as the son of Henry Bryan Chamberlain and the former Elizabeth Wolverton.<ref name="whos-onl">{{cite web | url=http://marquiswhoswho.com/ | title=People Search | publisher=Marquis Who's Who | access-date=January 21, 2015}} After search, entry found and purchased is for "Neil Cornelius Wolverton Chamberlain (Deceased) / economist, emeritus educator; Born: 1915"</ref>  When he was two years old the family moved to Ohio and he grew up in [[Lakewood, Ohio]].  From the time of [[junior high school]] on, he was interested in [[creative writing]], working on poems, short stories, and an incomplete novel.<ref>Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. vii.</ref>     While at [[Lakewood High School (Lakewood, Ohio)|Lakewood High School]], which he began as the [[Great Depression]] was starting,<ref name="whalen"/> he took third prize in national [[The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards|Scholastic Art & Writing Awards]] with a short story called "Hunger".<ref>{{cite book | title=Saplings: Verse, Short Stories, and Essays Selected from Manuscripts Written by High School Students in Competition for the Scholastic Awards | publisher=Scholastic Publishing | year=1933 | pages=6, 90}}</ref>  Another short story, "A Millionaire's Debut", was published in the ''[[Cleveland News]]''.<ref name="million">{{cite news | title=Daily Short Story: A Millionaire's Debut | first=Neil | last=Chamberlain | newspaper=The Cleveland News | date=1933}}</ref>

During vacations when he was 17 and 18, Chamberlain traveled around the country by [[hitchhiking]] and [[freighthopping]].<ref name="c-io-1"/>  A San Francisco newspaper recounted his {{convert|7000|mi|km|adj=on}} wandering journey with another 18-year-old friend from Cleveland to there, in which they started with only $3.77, washing dishes for funds while staying in [[hobo jungle]]s and sometimes encountering long waits for cars to pick them up.<ref>{{cite news | title=Hikers Find Few Hitches | publisher=San Francisco newspaper clip | date=Summer 1933 | page=3?}}</ref>  By the age of 19, he said he had traveled some {{convert|23000|mi|km}} and seen 41&nbsp;states.<ref name="talks"/>  He offered to give 15-minute talks, titled "The Category of Dreamers" and concerning the state of youth, in the Lakewood area.<ref name="talks">"The Category of Dreamers", flyer, c. 1934.</ref>

He attended [[Western Reserve University|Adelbert College of Western Reserve University]], having been granted a scholarship, and initially majored in history.<ref name="c-io-1">Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 1.</ref>   He was elected [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as a senior.<ref name="wru-commence-1937">{{cite web | url=http://digitalcase.case.edu:9000/fedora/get/ksl:uarchives-wrucmp1937/wrucmp1937.pdf | title=Commencement Convocation | publisher=Western Reserve University | location=Cleveland | date=June 16, 1937}}</ref>   He was also a poet there, winning first prize as a junior and second prize as a senior in the Rupert Hughes Prizes in Poetry.<ref name="wru-commence-1937"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://digitalcase.case.edu:9000/fedora/get/ksl:uarchives-wrucmp1936/wrucmp1936.pdf | title=Commencement Convocation | publisher=Western Reserve University | location=Cleveland | date=June 10, 1936}}</ref>  In 1937, he graduated with an A.B. degree magna cum laude.<ref name="wru-commence-1937"/>

Chamberlain was initially primarily interested in writing as a career possibility.<ref name="whalen"/> While a freshman he was also working as editor of the ''People's Penny Weekly'', a magazine intended to provide local coverage of Lakewood.<ref name="million"/>  During his senior year in college he worked part-time at the Cleveland bureau of the [[International News Service]].<ref name="c-io-2">Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 2.</ref>  There he covered many significant developments in labor relations during the mid-1930s.<ref name="whalen"/>  These included the [[Flint sit-down strike|Fisher Body sit-down strike against General Motors]].<ref name="c-io-2"/>

By his account he then tried two other writing and editing jobs before, after a year's lapse, returning to his education to give himself an understanding of the forces at play in these labor disputes.<ref name="c-io-3">Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 3.</ref>  At the Graduate School at Western Reserve University, he earned an M.A. degree in economics in 1939.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://digitalcase.case.edu:9000/fedora/get/ksl:uarchives-wrucmp1939/uarchives-wrucmp1939.pdf | title=Commencement Convocation | publisher=Western Reserve University | location=Cleveland | date=June 14, 1939}}</ref>  At the same time he wrote a play about the [[Chrysler Auto Strike of 1939]], ''From Now to Hallelujah'', which he later said was accepted for production at a local theater group but never put on due to a scheduling conflict.<ref name="c-io-3"/>  He also later recalled functioning as executive secretary of a successful campaign to amend the Cleveland city charter to bring most civil service employees under the [[merit system]].<ref>Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 147.</ref>

Chamberlain then obtained a Ph.D. in economics from [[Ohio State University]] in 1942.<ref name="whos-onl"/>  The topic of his dissertation was "The Nature and Practice of Collective Bargaining".<ref name="c-io-4"/>  By now his practice of other forms of writing was being replaced by his interest in economic research.<ref name="c-io-4"/>  During the latter portion of this time he was a research fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]].<ref name="whos-onl"/>

Chamberlain married the former [[Mariam Chamberlain|Mariam Kenosian]] in 1942.<ref name="whos-onl"/>

During the World War II period, he was in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] from 1942 to 1946, where he began as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] and finished as a [[lieutenant]].<ref name="whos-onl"/>  There he did work related to cryptography.  Meanwhile, his wife worked as an analyst for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during the war and then earned a Ph.D. in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1950.<ref name="nyt-mariam-obit"/>

==Early career==
Following his service, Chamberlain was given a [[Social Science Research Council]] demobilization fellowship and in 1946 found a position as research director at the [[Yale Labor and Management Center]], which had shortly before been founded by [[E. Wight Bakke]].<ref name="whos-onl"/><ref name="c-io-4">Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 4.</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/03/07/96420162.pdf | title=Common Meeting-Ground | first=George | last=Moskowitz | newspaper=The New York Times Book Review | date=March 7, 1948 | page=96}}</ref>  By 1947 he was also an assistant professor of economics at Yale.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/10/10/87820704.pdf | title=Management Role Urged for Unions | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 10, 1947 | page=15}}</ref>  His first major book, ''The Union Challenge to Management Control '', was published in 1948.  In 1949 he became assistant director of the Labor and Management Center.<ref name="whos-onl"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1951/10/03/87315730.html?pageNumber=36 | title=Wage Unit Appointed | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 3, 1951 | page=36}}</ref>  That same year, he became an associate professor.<ref name="whos-onl"/>

Chamberlain's early work at Yale and the center and his books published during this time focused on exploring matters related to bargaining in the context of labor-management conflicts, the social impact of strikes, and the idea of managerial discretion and how unions challenged it.<ref name="whalen"/>  His insights into industrial relations theory as a whole became a substantial addition to scholarly knowledge.<ref name="retro-3-143-145"/>  <!-- In his first major book, 1948's ''The Union Challenge to Management Control'', Chamberlain became one of the first scholars to examine in depth and empirically the effects of the union's role in management. ... r3 145–147 not sure worth getting into -->

His definition of [[bargaining power]], which is based upon the notion of the "inducement to agree", became widely used.<ref>{{cite book | first= Lloyd G. | last=Reynolds | title=Labor Economics and Labor Relations | url= https://archive.org/details/laboreconomicsla0006edreyn | url-access= registration | publisher=Prentice-Hall | location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | year= 1974 | page=[https://archive.org/details/laboreconomicsla0006edreyn/page/471 471]}}</ref>  Examining the history of many labor-management actions and conflicts as case studies, he analyzed their tactics with his framework of how each sought to influence relative bargaining power.<ref name="retro-3-143-145"/>  His analysis of bargaining power and its effects went beyond concepts introduced by others earlier and provided a springboard for the examination of behavioral aspects of the bargaining process as well as bargaining power as a dynamic entity.<ref name="retro-3-143-145"/>  Influencing several generations of scholars, Chamberlain's work on bargaining power would become his most significant contribution to the field.<ref name="retro-3-143-145">Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, "Neil W. Chamberlain", pp. 143–145.</ref>  His 1951 textbook ''Collective Bargaining'' presented some of these ideas and was twice later republished in revised editions.

His work on strikes, which was published in two books, ''Social Responsibility and Strikes'' (1953) and ''The Impact of Strikes: Their Social and Economic Costs'' (1954), was done in collaboration with Jane Metzger Schilling, an assistant in research at the center and a doctoral student in the Department of Economics at Yale<ref>Title and facing title pages of ''Social Responsibility and Strikes'' and ''The Impact of Strikes''; Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 18.</ref> who was working on research into invention and innovation and into the scope of bargaining units.  Their work devised a quantitative framework for analyzing the effect of strikes on the various parties involved as well as on the general public, making use of reliable figures when available and forming imprecise judgments when not, then sought to evaluate seventeen recent strikes in the coal, rail, and steel industries in these terms.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Chamberlain, Neil W. and Jane Metzger Schilling, ''The Impact of Strikes: Their Social and Economic Costs'' | first=Joel | last=Seidman | journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science | volume=294 | date=July 1954 | pages= 191–192 | doi=10.1177/000271625429400165 | jstor=1029285| s2cid=145105365 }}</ref>     They also made public policy recommendations regarding when government intervention should be undertaken, saying that such action must take into effect the loss of income for producers as well as the loss of goods and services for consumers.<ref>{{cite journal | title=''The Impact of Strikes'' by Neil W.

While Chamberlain self-identified as an [[industrial relations]] specialist, he nonetheless next wrote ''A General Theory of Economic Process'', an attempt to define the overall economic environment in ways that provided entrée for the insights of his labor analyses.<ref name="whalen"/>  It was the most ambitious effort he ever undertook.<ref name="retro-3-149-150"/>  In its preface he wrote, "Such an effort may appear pretentious when made by one who lays no claim to being a general theoretician ... I feel (almost apologetically) a need to explain the existence of this work."<ref>Chamberlain, ''A General Theory of Economic Process'', p. vii.</ref>  In it he used bargaining as the central element for economic analysis.<ref name="retro-3-149-150">Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, "Neil W. Chamberlain", pp. 149–150.</ref>

==Middle career==
Chamberlain moved to Columbia University, where he was a professor of economics in its Graduate School of Business from 1954–59.<ref name="whos-onl"/> There he replaced the retiring [[Paul Frederick Brissenden]] as head of the school's program in Labor and Industrial Relations.<ref name="c-io-56">Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 56.</ref>  This was part of a wave of hirings as the business school sought to improve its intellectual standing by strengthening its research program and instituting a Ph.D. program separate from that of the Department of Economics.<ref>{{cite book | first=Robert A. | last=McCaughey | title=Stand, Columbia: A History of Columbia University in the City of New York, 1754–2004 | url=https://archive.org/details/standcolumbiahis00aaro | url-access=limited | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York | year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/standcolumbiahis00aaro/page/n382 352]–353}}</ref>

During this time, Chamberlain was recruited by [[Thomas H. Carroll]] of the [[Ford Foundation]], who was starting an effort for the improvement of business school education.<ref name="c-io-56"/>  Chamberlain thus became director of the Program in Economic Development and Administration at the foundation from 1957 to 1960,<ref name="whos-onl"/>  where he also focused a research program on business decision making.<ref name="whalen"/> Chamberlain subsequently returned to Yale as a professor of economics for the period 1959–1967.<ref name="whos-onl"/>

In the 1960s, Chamberlain's research began to focus on [[theory of the firm]] and [[industrial organization]], as exemplified by his 1962 book ''The Firm: Micro-Economic Planning and Action''.<ref name="retro-3-151-153">Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, "Neil W. Chamberlain", pp. 151–153.</ref>   In particular he examined [[corporate planning]] and [[Economic planning#State development planning|public planning]].<ref name="whalen"/>  These works adopted some of the approaches of [[institutional economics]] and were less quantitative and more philosophical than some of the author's previous efforts.<ref name="retro-3-151-153"/>  He then branched out even further afield, writing about [[nuclear disarmament]] in 1963 and [[population economics]] in 1970.  In the first, he argued that "if what everyone says [they want] (peace and disarmament) is eventually achieved, the consequences are almost certain to be the end of 500 years of Western world supremacy."<ref>Chamberlain, ''The West in a World Without War'', p. vii.</ref>

Chamberlain was prominent in the [[Industrial Relations Research Association]], serving on its executive board during 1955–58 and its president in 1967.<ref name="whos-onl"/>  
Chamberlain served on the board of editors of ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' from 1957–59, the board of directors of the [[Salzburg Seminar in American Studies]] for 1957–78, the editorial council of ''[[Management International]]'' during 1960–70, and two stints on the board of trustees of the ''[[Columbia Journal of World Business]]'' (1969–72, 1975–80).<ref name="whos-onl"/>

He and his wife [[Mariam Chamberlain]] divorced in 1967.<ref name="whos-onl"/>  She joined the [[Ford Foundation]] and became the director of its higher education program; the grants she dispensed during the 1970s would become instrumental in establishing the place of women's studies at colleges in the United States.<ref name="nyt-mariam-obit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/education/mariam-chamberlain-womens-champion-dies-at-94.html?_r=0|first=Paul |last=Vitello|title=Mariam Chamberlain, Women's Champion, Dies at 94|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 8, 2013|page=B8}}</ref>

Chamberlain returned to Columbia's Graduate School of Business again to stay for good in 1967,<ref name="whos-onl"/> heading a new program in Corporate Relations and Public Policy.<ref>Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 97.</ref>  He was named the Armand G. Erpf Professor of Modern Corporations in 1969.<ref name="whos-onl"/><ref name="cu-hermes"/>  In the wake of the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]], Chamberlain was on the side of those who prized the restoration of order in American and European academies, signing on to a 1969 statement by hundreds of faculty members proclaiming that, "Academic freedom and the sanctuary of the university campus extend to all who share these aims and responsibilities. They cannot be invoked by those who would subordinate intellectual freedom to political ends, or who violate the norms of conduct established to protect that freedom. Against such offenders the university has the right, and indeed the obligation, to defend itself."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19690421-01.2.19.1 | title=The University As a Sanctuary of Academic Freedom (advertisement) | newspaper=Columbia University Spectator | date=April 21, 1969 | pages=8–9}}</ref>

==Later career==
During the latter part of his career, Chamberlain took on the analysis of the role of corporation management in society.<ref name="retro-3-153">Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, "Neil W. Chamberlain", p. 153.</ref>  In a series of books from 1973 on he became known as an economist who found insights in the relationship of business power to social power.<ref>{{cite book | first=William C. | last=Frederick | title=Values, Nature, and Culture in the American Corporation | url=https://archive.org/details/valuesnaturecult0000fred | url-access=registration | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | year=1995 | page=69n}}</ref>  He also became involved in community-related projects such as a 1972 plan to help decentralize city services in nearby [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19720110-01.2.6 | title=Students Will Aid in City Project | first=Richard | last=Briffault | newspaper=Columbia Daily Spectator | date=January 10, 1972 | page=1}}</ref>

Tackling the issue of [[corporate responsibility]], his 1973 book ''The Limits of Corporate Responsibility'' Chamberlain said that businesses could do "remarkably little" about urban problems, environmental degradation, product safety, or worker dissatisfaction, because the values of the business culture are incompatible with such goals and economic forces will constrain businesses to only actions which result in growth and profit.<ref name="nytbr-shepard"/>  Writing for ''The New York Times Book Review'', [[Stephen B. Shepard]] said that Chamberlain made a strong case for business not being able to solve urban woes, but that elsewhere he overstated his thesis and underestimated the chances that businesses could be part of environmental improvement solutions.<ref name="nytbr-shepard">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/02/24/148799612.pdf | title=The Limits of Corporate Responsibility | first=Stephen B. | last=Shepard | newspaper=The New York Times Book Review | date=February 24, 1974 | pages=34–35}}</ref>

Chamberlain retired in 1980,<ref name="cu-hermes"/> after which he became the Armand G. Erpf Professor Emeritus at Columbia.<ref name="whos-onl"/>  His last academic book, ''Social Strategy and Corporate Structure'', was published in 1982.<ref name="whalen"/>

Over the course of his career, Chamberlain became more pessimistic in his conclusions, believing that notions about union-management collaboration would have scant impact on the corporation's ability to react to external events.<ref name="retro-3-156">Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, "Neil W. Chamberlain", p. 156.</ref>   He also grew dissatisfied with the development of economic analysis, believing it too formal and beholden to quantitative methods and lacking a value-based look at how corporate management behaved.<ref name="retro-3-156"/>  Indeed, Chamberlain became skeptical about his discipline as a whole.  In the context of a 1980 ''New York Times'' piece about the hazards of poorly conducted social science research, he was quoted as saying, "We know very little about what we profess to know. We have claimed too much as a profession."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/09/07/114130399.pdf | title=Hazards in Social Research | first=Jenne K. | last=Britell | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 7, 1980 | page=EDU18}}</ref>  He came to have philosophical doubts about the entire study of economics, believing that purposeful action, unforeseen trends, and random occurrences combine to give economic theories that are based upon the observation of what has taken place in the past little predictive ability or policy-making usefulness in terms of what will take place in the future.<ref name="whalen"/>

Chamberlain thus abandoned economic work altogether after 1982, deciding that he wanted to return to writing fiction.  He worked on at least two novels during this period,<ref>Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', p. 213.</ref> although nothing was published, and he painted as well.  He published a memoir of sorts, ''Intellectual Odyssey: An Economist's Ideological Journey'', in 1996.  It traced the development of his interests and summarized the work and conclusions of many of his books.  The last chapter of the memoir includes lengthy excerpts from one of the novels, whose protagonist is a disillusioned economics professor considering whether to retire and struggling with philosophical questions.<ref>Chamberlain, ''Intellectual Odyssey'', pp. 213–218.</ref>

Chamberlain died at age 91 on September 14, 2006.<ref name="whos-onl"/><ref name="cu-hermes">{{cite news | url=http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/alumni/sites/alumni/files/hermes-winter-2007.pdf | title=In Memoriam: Neil W.

==Legacy==
Writing in the ''[[Journal of Economic Issues]]'' in 1996, Charles J. Whalen said that "Chamberlain's career in economics has been extraordinary."<ref name="whalen">{{cite journal | title= Intellectual Odyssey: An Economist's Ideological Journey by Neil W.

In a 1983 retrospective of Chamberlain's career written shortly after his retirement and published in the ''[[British Journal of Industrial Relations]]'', three business professors at Columbia University – James W. Kuhn, David Lewin, and Paul J. McNulty – analyzed where his work had had the greatest scholarly influence and where it had been less so.<ref name="retro-3">{{cite journal | first1=James W. | last1=Kuhn | first2= David | last2=Lewin | first3= Paul J. | last3=McNulty | title= Neil W.

In terms of the [[Labor history (discipline)|labor history discipline]], Chamberlain came to be seen as part of the mainstream, along with scholars such as [[Sumner Slichter]] and Richard Lester, who focused on institutions and laws, as opposed to "[[new labor history]]" and its adherents, such as [[David Brody (historian)|David Brody]] and [[Nelson Lichtenstein]], who focused more on demographics and social history.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/American+Labor+in+the+Era+of+World+War+II.-a018355642 | title=American Labor in the Era of World War II and The Unions Made Us Strong: Radical Unionism on the San Francisco Waterfront (book reviews) | first=B. J. | last=Widick | journal=Monthly Labor Review | date=April 1996}}</ref>  Like two other scholarly pioneers in industrial relations and labor research, [[Robert F. Hoxie]] and [[John R. Commons]], Chamberlain was dissatisfied with [[neoclassical economics]]-based theory and sought to provide new and different explanations for the economic process.<ref name="retro-3-157">Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, "Neil W. Chamberlain", p. 157.</ref>  This foray into general theory, like those of the other two, generally found few followers in the field.<ref name="retro-3-157"/>

Chamberlain was given a lifetime achievement award by the [[Industrial Relations Research Association]] for 2002, handed out during its 2003 meeting.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lera.uiuc.edu/Awards/lifetime/Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award.htm | title=Lifetime Achievement Award | publisher=Labor and Employment Relations Association | access-date=January 27, 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://archive.is/20150127141950/http://www.lera.uiuc.edu/Awards/lifetime/Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award.htm | archive-date=January 27, 2015 }} (The IRRA subsequently renamed itself to the Labor and Employment Relations Association.)</ref>  He was one of the first members of that association to be so honored.<ref name="lipsky"/>

Following his death, Dean of the Columbia Business School [[Glenn Hubbard (economist)|Glenn Hubbard]] said Chamberlain that "produced work of great importance to the greater business community, always with an active and curious mind."<ref name="cu-hermes"/>  David B. Lipsky, former Dean of the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]], characterized Chamberlain as "one of the greatest of all industrial relations scholars" and said that, "For scholars of my generation, Neil was a giant – through the rigor and originality of his research he inspired us to believe that a career devoted to industrial relations research could be a noble undertaking."<ref name="lipsky">{{cite web | url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&context=conference | title=Conflict Resolution and the Transformation of the Social Contract | first=David B. | last=Lipsky | publisher=Labor and Employment Relations Association | date=January 6, 2007 }}</ref>
