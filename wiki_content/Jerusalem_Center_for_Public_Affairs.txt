The '''Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs''' ('''JCPA''') is an Israeli research institute specializing in [[public diplomacy]] and foreign policy founded in 1976. Currently, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs's research portfolio consists of five primary initiatives: the Institute for Contemporary Affairs (ICA), Defensible Borders Initiative, Jerusalem in International Diplomacy, Iran and the New Threats to the West, and Combating Delegitimization.<ref>"About the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/about/</ref> More broadly, the think-tank concentrates on the topics of Iran, Radical Islam, the Middle East, Israel, the Peace Process, Jerusalem, Anti-Semitism, and World Jewry.<ref>"Books," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/book/#</ref> Its publications include the academic journal ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' and the email-distributed ''Daily Alert'', a daily regional news summary. The research institute is a registered [[non-profit organization]] and produces content in English, Hebrew, French, and German.<ref>"Support Us," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/support-us/</ref>

The JCPA is considered to be politically [[neo-conservative]].<ref name="JewishJournal">{{cite news |newspaper= Jewish Journal |author= Noam Shelef |title= False equivalence in Israel |date= 29 January 2016 |url= https://jewishjournal.com/opinion/181749 |access-date=12 June 2019 }}</ref> It is being financed to a large degree by [[Sheldon Adelson]], a steadfast supporter of [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlement]] of the [[West Bank]].<ref name="Adelson"/>

==History==
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs was established in 1978 by [[Daniel Elazar]] as an umbrella organization encompassing the Center for Jewish Community Studies and the Jerusalem Institute for Federal Studies. Elazar personally raised most of the funds for the operation of the organization and the restoration of an historic building on Tel Hai Street in Jerusalem, named in honor of the Milken family.<ref name="Elazar">{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/vp-420-gerstenfeld.htm |title=The Intellectual World of Daniel Elazar |publisher=Jcpa.org |access-date=2011-11-11}}</ref> The building, Beit Milken, served as the Embassy of [[Uruguay]] from 1957 to 1980, when Uruguay decided to move their embassy to [[Tel Aviv]].<ref name="Uruguay">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8-ZUAAAAIBAJ&pg=6410%2C1424678 |title=Uruguay Embassy Leaves Jerusalem |publisher=The Age |date=1980-08-18 |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref> In 1989, the 1,200 ton building was moved 16 meters on rails to reach the site it currently occupies.<ref name="Building">{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/our-building-a-protected-jerusalem-landmark/ |title=Our Building: A Protected Jerusalem Landmark |publisher=Jcpa.org |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref>

Dr. Dore Gold, Israel's former ambassador to the [[UN]] and former foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], headed the Jerusalem Center from 2000<ref name="About">{{cite web |url= http://jcpa.org/about |title= About the Jerusalem Center |publisher= jcpa.org |access-date=2013-04-14}}</ref> to 2015, when he took a [[leave of absence]] to become director-general of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Keinon |first= Herb |title= Dore Gold picked as new Foreign Ministry director-general |url= http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Dore-Gold-picked-as-new-Foreign-Ministry-director-general-404015 |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=May 25, 2015 |access-date=September 3, 2015}}</ref> Gold returned as president of the Jerusalem Center.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dore Gold Returns to Head the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |url=http://jcpa.org/dore-gold-returns-to-head-the-jerusalem-center-for-public-affairs/ |website=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |access-date=12 June 2019 |date=30 October 2016}}</ref>

==Political orientation==
The JCPA has been described as [[neo-conservative]].<ref name="JewishJournal"/> It has been headed since 2000 by "[[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] confidante" [[Dore Gold]].<ref name="MuftiAdolf">{{cite news |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |author= Chemi Shalev |title= Adelson-linked Think Tank Article Preceded Netanyahu's Hitler-Mufti Claim |date=24 October 2015 |url= https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-adelson-linked-think-tank-article-preceded-pm-s-mufti-claim-1.5412970 |access-date=12 June 2019 }}</ref> In 2015 [[Haaretz]] identified [[Sheldon Adelson]] as "one of the main financers of JCPA in recent years";<ref name="MuftiAdolf"/> Adelson is an American billionaire casino magnate, staunch supporter of [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlement]] of the [[West Bank]] and biggest contributor to [[Republican Party (United States)|US Republicans]] in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 US midterm elections]] during President [[Donald Trump]]'s mandate.<ref name="Adelson">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |author= Jeremy W.

==Self-declared policy positions==
===Israeli internal politics===
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs does not comment, publish, or advocate any explicit policy decisions concerning Israeli domestic security. Accordingly, no articles, videos, or major publications on the think-tank's website will discuss political coalitions in Israel nor mention its major parties (e.g. Likud, Zionist Union, etc.).

===Final status negotiations===
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is an organisation which largely focuses on Israeli security, regional diplomacy, and international law.<ref>"Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs Home Page," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/</ref> The essence of the organization's positions regarding final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians was articulated within their ''Defensible Borders Initiative''. A continuing project dating back to the early-2000s, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has made explicit their stance on the matter, particularly in a YouTube video released in May 2010.<ref name="youtube.com">"Israel's Critical Security Needs for a Viable Peace," The Jerusalem Center, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWmPqY8TE0</ref>

The think-tank is a supporter of the two-state solution calling for a "demilitarized Palestinian state" alongside Israel.<ref name="youtube.com"/>

===Jordan Valley===
Regarding the Jordan Rift Valley, the organization is opposed to the presence of international peacekeeping troops given their poor track-record in the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and Southern Lebanon (see [[United Nations Emergency Force]] and [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]]). Accordingly, the organization argues that Israel must retain control of the Jordan Valley. Concerning the future of the Palestinian territories, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs advocates for demilitarization and Israel's ability to exercise control of airspace and electromagnetic communications throughout Judea and Samaria (otherwise known as the West Bank).

===Jerusalem's final status===
Research conducted by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs fellow Nadav Shragai, as well as, the organization's program ''Jerusalem in International Diplomacy'' maintain that Jerusalem should remain unified and under Israeli sovereignty.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Jerusalem in International Diplomacy," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/jerusalem/</ref>

===Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement===
The organization is opposed to, and actively seeks to undermine, the [[BDS movement]]. Another core program of the institute, ''Combating Delegitimization and BDS'', alongside the work of [[Dan Diker]] demonstrates the movement's objectives of achieving a [[one-state solution]], dismantling Israel, and its correlation with anti-Semitism incidents.<ref name="ReferenceB">"Combating Delegitimization and BDS," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/combating-delegitimization-and-bds/</ref>

==Publications==
===Periodical publications===
====''Jewish Political Studies Review''====
The JCPA publishes the academic journal, ''Jewish Political Studies Review''. The journal is published biannually and is "the first and only journal dedicated to the study of Jewish political institutions and behavior, Jewish political thought, and Jewish public affairs."<ref name="JPSR">{{cite journal |title=Introduction |journal=Jewish Political Studies Review |volume=23 |date=Spring 2011 |page=2}}</ref>

====''Daily Alert''====
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs also produces the ''Daily Alert'' for the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], a daily news summary and analysis concerning Israel, Iran, radical Islam, and other regional security issues distributed through email.<ref>"Daily Alert," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, June 13, 2017, http://www.dailyalert.org/</ref>

===Recent publications===
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has recently published multiple studies relating to Israeli security, international diplomacy, and the status of Jerusalem. As part of the organization's emphasis on making their material public and accessible, all of their major survey studies are digitalized and published on their website.<ref>"Books," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/book/</ref>

In the wake of the so-called 'Knife Intifada', the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs published a collection edited by in-house author [[Fiamma Nirenstein]].<ref>Fiamma Nirenstein, ed., "Lessons from Israel's Response to Terrorism," 2017, http://jcpa.org/lessons-israels-response-terrorism/</ref> 

Another work published in 2016 by in-house author Dan Diker was an in-depth exploration of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction (BDS) movement. Entitled ''BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends'', Diker traces the roots of the BDS movement arguing that it represents only the most recent incarnation of a historical attempt to boycott Israel. The publication also references foundational members of BDS (e.g. [[Omar Barghouti]]) in demonstrating the movement's support for the one-state solution and dismantling of the Israeli state.<ref name="Dan Diker">Dan Diker, BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2016), 6-8, http://jcpa.org/pdf/Unmasking_.pdf</ref>{{rp|6&ndash;8}} The book also demonstrates a powerful relationship between BDS activities and anti-Semitic incidents on university campuses.<ref name="Dan Diker"/>{{rp|81}}

Jerusalem also features largely in the think-tank's work. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs member, [[Nadav Shragai]], published a historical and legal evaluation of Jerusalem and the city's role in final status peace negotiations entitled ''<ref name="Nadav Shragai">Nadav Shragai, Jerusalem: Delusions of Division (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2015)</ref>''. Informed, in part, by recent polling data from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Shragai argues that a majority of Jerusalem's Arabs favour preserving their Israeli citizenship rather than substituting it for a Palestinian one.<ref name="Nadav Shragai"/>{{rp|Preface}} More importantly for Shagrai, Jerusalem's Arab community is increasingly being incorporated into the Jewish municipal fabric and represents a valuable dimension to future negotiations over the status of Jerusalem.<ref name="Nadav Shragai"/>{{rp|Introduction}}

===Other===
The JCPA produces a publication entitled "Changing Jewish Communities," which is less focused on global anti-Semitism and, therefore, addresses a wide variety of issues related to global Jewish communities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/results.cfm?PublicationName=Changing%20Jewish%20Communities | title=Publication name Changing Jewish Communities - Berman Jewish Policy Archive @ Stanford University}}</ref>

The JCPA has organized a publication called "Jewish Environmental Studies," which looks deeply at Jewish environmental studies as a separate and important field and analyzes Jewish environmental thought through references from the [[Bible]] and classic Jewish texts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=3847|title=Jewish Environmental Studies: a New Field}}</ref>

===Video===
In addition to their written publications, the JCPA produces numerous videos that analyze a variety of issues pertaining to Israel and the Middle East. These include videos created by the center as well as videos of JCPA contributors appearing in various news outlets or conference venues. The videos can be found on the JCPA website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/media/videos/|title=TheJerusalemCenter|via=YouTube}}</ref> or on the JCPA’s YouTube page.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJerusalemCenter|title=TheJerusalemCenter|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Institute for Global Jewish Affairs===
In 2008, JCPA founded the '''Institute for Global Jewish Affairs''' in response to growing international anti-Semitism. Directed by [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]], the institute addresses a variety of topics related to Jewish communities around the world.<ref name="ovguide.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.ovguide.com/institute-for-global-jewish-affairs-9202a8c04000641f8000000009273a03# |title= Watch "Institute for Global Jewish Affairs" Video |work= OVGuide |access-date= 2013-11-12 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113054805/http://www.ovguide.com/institute-for-global-jewish-affairs-9202a8c04000641f8000000009273a03 |archive-date= 2013-11-13 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

The institute helps direct the "Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project" and its associated monthly publication "Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism," both of which attend to global anti-Semitism.<ref name="unmaskedthemovie.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.unmaskedthemovie.com/learn_more/related_websites.html |title= UNMASKED JUDEOPHOBIA - The Threat to Civilization }}</ref>

==Conferences==
On March 24, 2014, the Jerusalem Center held a conference entitled "Europe and Israel: A New Paradigm." The conference focused on the complicated relationship between Israel and [[Europe]], including topics such as economics and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS]] movement, security and anti-Semitism. The conference was well attended and received a significant amount of press, including articles in ''[[The Times of Israel]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/eu-ready-to-pay-palestinians-who-renounce-right-of-return/|title=EU ready to pay Palestinians who renounce right of return|work=The Times of Israel}}</ref> ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/EU-aid-package-meant-to-assure-Israel-that-Palestine-wont-become-a-failed-state-346334|title=EU aid package meant to assure Israel that 'Palestine' won't become a failed state|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}</ref> J-Wire,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jwire.com.au/news/lovehate-relationship/41528 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406204045/http://www.jwire.com.au/news/lovehate-relationship/41528 |archive-date=2014-04-06 }}</ref> [[Ynetnews]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4502877,00.html|title=EU-Israel ties growing, despite disagreements|work=ynet}}</ref> and [[CBN News]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2014/March/Israeli-EU-Trade-Relations-in-Tact/|title=Israeli, EU Trade in Tact [sic] Despite BDS}}</ref>

==Programs and initiatives==
===Combating delegitimization and BDS===

A core component of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs concerns efforts by the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement to [[Delegitimisation|delegitimize]] Israel. According to the organization's website, the initiative "is a major multilingual public diplomacy program" which seeks to expose those who undermine Israel's very legitimacy.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> This programme entails reinforcing the connection between "the Jewish people and their historical homeland including Jerusalem."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Jerusalem in international diplomacy===

Jerusalem's centrality to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) has ensured that it is a subject which garners disproportionate scrutiny.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The intermingling of religious, political, and legal dimensions has encouraged the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs to publish extensively on the subject. Spearheaded by Nadav Shragai, the initiative has led to such publications as, ''Jerusalem: Delusions of Division'' (2015), ''Jerusalem: Correcting the International Discourse'' (2012), and ''The 'Al-Aksa Is in Danger Libel: The History of a Lie'' (2012).<ref>"Nadav Shragai," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/researcher/nadav-shragai/</ref> As outlined in the organization's policy video, the interlocking Arab and Jewish neighbourhoods of Jerusalem make division unfeasible. Mindful of Jerusalem's history during the Jordanian occupation when religious freedoms were curtailed, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs believes that the city must remain undivided and under Israeli sovereignty.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Iran and the New Threats to the West===

This program focuses on security threats posed by Iran to Israel and the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/about/|title=About the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|work=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs}}</ref> The program began with a publication entitled “Referral of Iranian President Ahmadinejad on the Charge of Incitement to Commit Genocide,” authored by [[Dore Gold]] and [[Elie Wiesel]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots777=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&lng=en&id=43807|title=Referral of Iranian President Ahmadinejad on the Charge of Incitement to Commit Genocide|author=ISN Editors}}</ref> The publication was created in response to multiple threats directed toward Israel by the Iranian leader, including a 2006 declaration that “Israel should be wiped off the map.”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/articleuploads/iran_infocus1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105105359/http://www.brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/articleuploads/iran_infocus1.pdf |archive-date=2013-11-05 }}</ref> The JCPA continues to monitor security threats posed by Iran in the post-Ahmadinejad era with this program.

===Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project===

Initiated by [[Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld]], the program focuses on anti-Semitism after the Holocaust and "its origins and lessons, manifestations and mutations."<ref name="gerstenfeld">"Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/publication/phas/</ref> The initiative produces a monthly publication which addresses issues concerning past and presents acts directed against World Jewry and, among other issues, highlights anti-Israel boycotts, the manipulation of Holocaust history, and anti-Semitism emanating from Muslim and Christian communities. The program consists of conferences, seminars, lectures, interviews, and essays. As well, its content is available in English and French. The most recent publication, "Why a New Academic Discipline of Post-Holocaust Studies Should Be Established and What Its Content Should Be", argues that while the Holocaust has been instrumental in shaping modern society, its study is often confined to mass murder while its continued influence today is often neglected.<ref name="gerstenfeld"/>

===Global Law Forum===

This program covers issues pertaining to Israel and international law. The goal of the program is to “protect Israel’s legal rights in its conflict with the Palestinians, the Arab world, and radical Islam.”<ref>{{Google books |id=wYZdOSthmdoC |page=237 |title=Israel’s Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy }}</ref> Topics include the legality of settlements, human rights, and Israeli border issues, among others. [[Avi Bell]] directs the program. Additional contributors include Robert Sabel, [[Ruth Lapidoth]], Irit Kohn, [[Alan Baker (diplomat)|Alan Baker]], [[Meir Rosenne]], and [[Justus Weiner]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
