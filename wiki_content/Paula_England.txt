England's research showed that both men and women earn less if they work in a predominantly female occupation, even after adjusting for differences between occupations in the skill and education they require.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kilbourne |first1=Barbara |last2=England |first2=Paula |last3=Farkas |first3=George |last4=Beron |first4=Kurt |last5=Weir |first5=Dorothea |title=Return to skills, compensating differentials, and gender bias: effects of occupational characteristics on the wages of white women and men |journal= [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume =100 | issue = 3 |pages=689–719 |doi=10.1086/230578 | date = November 1994 |s2cid=145799264 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = England | first1 = Paula | last2 = Farkas | first2 = George | last3 = Kilbourne |first3=Barbara |last4 = Dou | first4 = Thomas | title = Explaining occupational sex segregation and wages: findings from a model with fixed effects | journal = [[American Sociological Review]] | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 544–558 | doi=10.2307/2095848 | date = August 1988 | jstor = 2095848 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = England | first = Paula | title = Comparable Worth: Theories and Evidence | url = https://archive.org/details/comparablewortht0000engl | url-access = registration | publisher = Aldine de Gruyter | location = New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-0-202-30349-9 }}</ref> She called this a type of sex discrimination distinct from lack of equal pay for equal work in the same job, and distinct from the hiring discrimination against women trying to enter jobs. She argued that employers—consciously or unconsciously—take the sex composition of jobs into account when they set pay levels, acting as if jobs done by women can't be worth much. She argued that this bias reflects a general cultural devaluation of women and roles associated with women, and that institutional inertia cements this bias into wage structures.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Hartmann | first = Heidi | author-link = Heidi Hartmann | url = http://www.aapss.org/news/2010/06/01/paula-england-why-female-dominated-jobs-systematically-pay-less | title = Paula England: Why female-dominated jobs systematically pay less | date = 1 June 2010 | work = AAPSS news | publisher = [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]] | access-date = May 29, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160806052844/http://www.aapss.org/news/2010/06/01/paula-england-why-female-dominated-jobs-systematically-pay-less | archive-date = August 6, 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref> She also showed that when occupations feminize, their pay goes down.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Levanon|first1=Asaf|last2=England|first2=Paula|last3=Allison|first3=Paul|title=Occupational feminization and pay: assessing casual dynamics using 1950–2000 census data |journal= [[Social Forces]] |volume= 88|issue=2 |pages=865–892 |doi= 10.1353/sof.0.0264 |date= December 2009 |s2cid=154788436}}</ref>
