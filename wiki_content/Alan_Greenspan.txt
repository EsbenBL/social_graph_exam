'''Alan Greenspan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|n|_|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|n|s|p|æ|n}}; born March 6, 1926) is an American [[economist]] who served five terms as the 13th [[chair of the Federal Reserve]] in the United States from 1987 to 2006. He works as a private adviser and provides consulting for firms through his company, Greenspan Associates LLC. First appointed [[Federal Reserve]] chairman by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in August 1987, he was reappointed at successive four-year intervals until retiring on January 31, 2006, after the second-longest tenure in the position (behind [[William McChesney Martin]]).<ref>{{cite news|author1= Benjamin M.

Greenspan came to the [[Federal Reserve Board]] from a consulting career. Although he was subdued in his public appearances, favorable media coverage raised his profile to a point that several observers likened him to a "rock star".<ref>{{cite news |last=Aversa |first=Jeannine |title=Alan Greenspan Enjoys Rock Star Renown |date=March 5, 2005 |url= http://www.chron.com/business/article/Alan-Greenspan-enjoys-rock-star-renown-1914177.php |work=Houston Chronicle |access-date=December 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Evans-Pritchard |first =Ambrose |title=Greenspan Was More a Rock Star than a Feared Fed Sage |date=September 17, 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/2815893/Greenspan-was-more-a-rock-star-than-a-feared-Fed-sage.html |access-date=December 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stahl |first =Leslie |title=Greenspan Defends Low Interest Rates |date=February 11, 2009 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-3257567.html?pageNum=5 |work=CBS News |access-date=December 7, 2011}}</ref> Democratic leaders of Congress criticized him for politicizing his office because of his support for [[Social Security privatization]]<ref name="washtime">{{cite news |url =http://www.washtimes.com/news/2005/mar/04/20050304-102717-1490r/ |title=Reid Sticks by Greenspan Comments |date=March 5, 2005 |work =The Washington Times |access-date=October 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205194350/http://www.washtimes.com/news/2005/mar/04/20050304-102717-1490r/ |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> and tax cuts.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/politics/03deficit.html |title=Greenspan says Federal Budget Deficits are 'Unsustainable{{'-}} |first=Edmund L. |last=Andrews |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=March 3, 2005 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref>

Many have argued that the [[Easy money policy|"easy-money" policies]] of the Fed during Greenspan's tenure, including the practice known as the "[[Greenspan put]]", were a leading cause of the [[dot-com bubble]] and [[subprime mortgage crisis]] (the latter occurring within a year of his leaving the Fed), which, said ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', "tarnished his reputation".<ref name="WSJ January 13, 2012">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204409004577157001537763864 |title=Little Alarm Shown at Fed At Dawn of Housing Bust |last1=Hilsenrath |first1=Jon |last2=Di Leo |first2=Luca |last3=Derby |first3=Michael S. |date=January 13, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=January 24, 2012 |name-list-style=amp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Teeter|first1=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2017|title=Cracking the enigma of asset bubbles with narratives|journal=Strategic Organization|volume=15|issue=1|pages=91–99|doi=10.1177/1476127016629880|s2cid=156163200}}</ref> Yale economist [[Robert Shiller]] argues that "once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed".<ref name="Shiller Barron's">{{cite news |last=Shiller|first=Robert |title=The Bubble's New Home |work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] |date=June 20, 2005 |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB111905372884363176.html |quote=Once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed.

==Early life and education==
Greenspan was born in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] area of New York City. His father, Herbert Greenspan, was of [[Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish]] descent, and his mother, Rose Goldsmith, was of [[Hungarian Jewish]] descent.{{Sfn|Greenspan|2007|p=19}} After his parents divorced, Greenspan grew up with his mother in the household of his maternal grandparents who were born in Russia.<ref>[https://www.ancestry.de/interactive/2442/m-t0627-02677-00235/4331766?backurl=https://www.ancestry.de/family-tree/person/tree/118684281/person/150178624565/facts/citation/600407567938/edit/record]</ref> His father worked as a stockbroker and market analyst in New York City.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/06/style/alan-greenspan-andrea-mitchell.html "Alan Greenspan, Andrea Mitchell"], ''The New York Times'', April 6, 1997</ref>

Greenspan attended [[George Washington High School (New York City)|George Washington High School]] from 1940 until he graduated in June 1943, where one of his classmates was [[John George Kemeny|John Kemeny]].{{Sfn|Greenspan|2007|p=24}} He played [[clarinet]] and [[saxophone]] along with [[Stan Getz]]. He further studied clarinet at the [[Juilliard School]] from 1943 to 1944.{{Sfn|Martin|2000|pp=11–13}} Among his bandmates in the [[Woody Herman|Woody Herman band]] was [[Leonard Garment]], [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[White House Counsel|special counsel]]. In 1945, Greenspan attended [[New York University Stern School of Business|New York University's Stern School of Business]], where he earned a B.A. degree in economics ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1948{{Sfn|Martin|2000|p=27}} and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in economics in 1950.{{Sfn|Greenspan|2007|p=33}} At [[Columbia University]], he pursued advanced economic studies under [[Arthur Burns]] but dropped because of his increasing work demand at Townsend-Greenspan & Company.{{Sfn|Martin|2000|pp=27–31}}

In 1977, Greenspan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from New York University. His dissertation is not available from the university<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=McTague |title=Dr. Greenspan's Amazing Invisible Thesis |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB120675340444773623.html?mod=b_hpp_9_0002_b_this_weeks_magazine_home_right |work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] |date=March 31, 2008 |access-date=October 17, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406132920/http://online.barrons.com/article/SB120675340444773623.html?mod=b_hpp_9_0002_b_this_weeks_magazine_home_right |archive-date=April 6, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> since it was removed at Greenspan's request in 1987, when he became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.

==Career==
===Before the Federal Reserve===
During his economics studies at New York University, Greenspan worked under Eugene Banks, a [[managing director]] at the [[Wall Street]] investment bank [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], in the firm's equity research department.{{Sfn|Greenspan|2007|p=31}} From 1948 to 1953, Greenspan worked as an analyst at the National Industrial Conference Board (currently known as [[the Conference Board]]), a business- and industry-oriented [[think tank]] in New York City.{{Sfn|Greenspan|2007|pp=32–34, 41–45}} Before he was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve, from 1955 to 1987, Greenspan was chairman and president of Townsend-Greenspan & Co., Inc., an economics consulting firm in New York City. His 32-year stint there was interrupted only from 1974 to 1977, when he served as chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]], under President [[Gerald Ford]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In mid-1968, Greenspan agreed to serve as Richard Nixon's coordinator on domestic policy in the nomination campaign.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Ambrose |author-link=Stephen Ambrose |title=Nixon |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location=New York |year=1987 |page=[https://archive.org/details/nixon00ambr_0/page/158 158] |isbn=978-0-671-52837-9 |oclc=14414031 |url=https://archive.org/details/nixon00ambr_0/page/158 }}</ref> Greenspan has also served as a corporate director for [[Alcoa|Aluminum Company of America]] (Alcoa); [[Automatic Data Processing]]; [[American Broadcasting Company|Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.]]; [[General Foods]]; [[J.P.

[[File:Mvc-017x.jpg|left|thumb|Alan Greenspan in 2005]]
On June 2, 1987, President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Greenspan as a successor to [[Paul Volcker]], as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmed him on August 11, 1987.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs |title=Nomination of Alan Greenspan: Hearing Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, One Hundredth Congress, First Session, July 21, 1987 |date=July 21, 1987 |publisher=US Government Printing Office |url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/279}}</ref> Investor, author and commentator [[Jim Rogers]] has said that Greenspan lobbied to get this chairmanship.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jim |last=Rogers |author-link=Jim Rogers |title=Adventure Capitalist: The Ultimate Road Trip |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-375-50912-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateinvestor00jimr}}</ref>

Two months after his confirmation, Greenspan said immediately following the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock market crash]] that the Fed "affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system".<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/feds/2007/200713/200713pap.pdf |title=A Brief History of the 1987 Stock Market Crash with a Discussion of the Federal Reserve Response |first=Mark |last=Carlson |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Federal Reserve Board]] |date=November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/01/fed-bernanke-greenspan-oped-cx_jt_0702dollar.html |title=In 2008, Shades of October 1987 |first=John |last=Tamny |magazine=Forbes |date=July 2, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611231632/http://www.forbes.com/2008/07/01/fed-bernanke-greenspan-oped-cx_jt_0702dollar.html |archive-date=June 11, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1538304.stm |title=Central Banks Promise Support |work=[[BBC News]] |date=September 12, 2001 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref> Although the Federal Reserve followed its announcement with monetary policy actions, which became known as the [[Greenspan put]], [[George H.&nbsp;W. Bush]] attributed his re-election loss to a sluggish response. Democratic president [[Bill Clinton]] reappointed Greenspan, and consulted him on economic matters. Greenspan lent support to Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction program.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/AR2006012602123_3.html |title=Chairman Moved a Nation |work=The Washington Post |first=Nell |last=Henderson |date=January 27, 2006}}</ref> Greenspan was fundamentally [[monetarist]] in orientation on the economy, and his monetary policy decisions largely followed standard [[Taylor rule]] prescriptions (see Taylor 1993 and 1999). Greenspan also played a key role in organizing the U.S. bailout of Mexico during the 1994–1995 [[Mexican peso crisis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/larry-summers/ |title=Larry Summers on Conversations with Bill Kristol |website=Conversations with Bill Kristol |access-date=September 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 2000, Greenspan raised interest rates several times; these actions were believed by many to have caused the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]]. According to [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]], however, "he didn't raise interest rates to curb the market's enthusiasm; he didn't even seek to impose margin requirements on stock market investors. Instead, he waited until the bubble burst, as it did in 2000, then tried to clean up the mess afterward".<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Krugman |author-link=Paul Krugman |title=The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 |url=https://archive.org/details/returnofdepressi00krug |url-access=registration |publisher=W.W.

In January 2001, Greenspan, in support of President Bush's proposed tax decrease, stated that the federal surplus could accommodate a significant tax cut while paying down the national debt.<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard W. |last=Stevenson |work=The New York Times |title=Down Into the Fray |date=January 27, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/27/business/down-into-the-fray.html |access-date=January 7, 2013}}</ref>

In autumn 2001, as a decisive reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]] and various corporate scandals which undermined the economy, the Greenspan-led Federal Reserve initiated a series of interest cuts that brought down the [[federal funds rate]] to 1% in 2004. While presenting the [[Monetary Policy Report to the Congress|Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report]] in July 2002, he said that "It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously", and suggested that financial markets need to be more regulated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/hh/2002/july/testimony.htm |title=Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan |publisher= Federal Reserve Board | date=July 16, 2002 | access-date=July 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607103641/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/hh/2002/july/testimony.htm |archive-date=June 7, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> His critics, led by [[Steve Forbes]], attributed the rapid rise in [[commodity]] prices and [[Gold as an investment|gold]] to Greenspan's loose monetary policy, which Forbes believed had caused excessive asset inflation and a weak dollar. By late 2004, the price of gold was higher than its 12-year moving average.

Greenspan advised senior members of the George W. Bush administration to depose [[Saddam Hussein]] for the sake of the oil markets.<ref name="The Wall Street Journal">{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/09/17/qa-greenspan-on-bubbles-saddam-cheney-and-bernanke/ |title=Q&A: Greenspan on Bubbles, Saddam, Cheney and Bernanke |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 17, 2007 |access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref> He believed that even a moderate disruption to the flow of oil could translate into high oil prices,<ref name="The Washington Post">{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/16/AR2007091601287.html |title = Greenspan: Ouster Of Hussein Crucial For Oil Security|first1= Bob |last1=Woodward|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 17, 2007 |access-date= June 8, 2016}}</ref> which could lead to "chaos" in the global economy and bring the industrial world "to its knees".<ref name="The Irish Times">{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/greenspan-says-invasion-and-war-largely-about-oil-1.962612 |title=Greenspan Says Invasion and War 'Largely about Oil'|newspaper=The Irish Times |date=September 17, 2007 |access-date= June 8, 2016}}</ref> He feared that Saddam could seize control of the Straits of Hormuz and restrict the transport of oil through them.

If that flow is shut off, it causes catastrophic effects in the industrial world. And it's that which made him [Saddam] far more important to get out than bin Laden."<ref name="The Huffington Post">{{cite news |url=http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/david-fiderer/the-simple-arithmetic-of_b_100021.html |title=The Simple Arithmetic of John McCain's Bogus Claims of Energy Independence|work=The Huffington Post |date=May 5, 2008 |access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>

On May 18, 2004, Greenspan was nominated by President [[George W. Bush]] to serve for an unprecedented fifth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. He was previously appointed to the post by Presidents Reagan, George H.&nbsp;W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.

In a May 2005 speech, Greenspan stated: "Two years ago at this conference I argued that the growing array of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and the related application of more-sophisticated methods for measuring and managing risks had been key factors underlying the remarkable resilience of the banking system, which had recently shrugged off severe shocks to the economy and the financial system. At the same time, I indicated some concerns about the risks associated with derivatives, including the risks posed by concentration in certain derivatives markets, notably the [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) markets for U.S. dollar interest rate options."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050505/default.htm |title=Risk Transfer and Financial Stability |date=May 5, 2005 |access-date=May 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530104529/http://federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050505/default.htm |archive-date=May 30, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Greenspan's term as a member of the board ended on January 31, 2006, and [[Ben Bernanke]] was confirmed as his successor.

As chairman of the board, Greenspan did not give any broadcast interviews from 1987 through 2005.<ref name="Davies">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4562488.stm |work=BBC News |title=Deficits Could Harm Greenspan's Legacy |last=Davies |first=Sir Howard |author-link=Howard Davies (economist) |date=December 29, 2005 |access-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref>

===After the Federal Reserve===
Immediately after leaving the Fed, Greenspan formed an [[economic consulting]] firm, Greenspan Associates LLC.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/06/AR2006110600588.html |first=Nell |last=Henderson |title=Greenspan Unconcerned About Housing |work= The Washington Post |date=November 7, 2006 |access-date=April 26, 2011}}</ref> He also accepted an honorary (unpaid) position at [[HM Treasury]] in the United Kingdom.

On February 26, 2007, Greenspan forecast a possible [[recession]] in the United States before or in early 2008.<ref>{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Greenspan Warns of U.S. Recession Risk |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17343814 |work=NBC News |date=February 26, 2007 |access-date=October 17, 2008}}</ref> Stabilizing corporate profits are said to have influenced his comments.

In May 2007, Greenspan was hired as a special consultant by [[Pacific Investment Management Company]] (PIMCO) to participate in their quarterly economic forums and speak privately with the bond managers about Fed interest rate policy.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN1546703720070516 |title =Pimco Hires Greenspan as Consultant: Report |work=Reuters |date=May 16, 2007 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref>

In mid-January 2008, [[hedge fund]] [[Paulson & Co.]] hired Greenspan as an adviser. According to the terms of their agreement, he was not to advise any other hedge fund while working for Paulson. In 2007, Paulson had foreseen the collapse of the sub-prime housing market and hired [[Goldman Sachs]] to package their sub-prime holdings into derivatives and sell them.

On April 30, 2009, Greenspan offered a defense of the [[H-1B visa]] program, telling a U.S. Senate subcommittee that the visa quota is "far too small to meet the need" and saying that it protects U.S. workers from global competition, creating a "privileged elite". Testifying on immigration reform before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, he said more skilled immigration was needed "as the economy copes with the forthcoming retirement wave of skilled baby boomers".<ref>{{cite news |title=Greenspan: H-1B Cap Would Make U.S. Workers 'Privileged Elite{{'-}} |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9132438/Greenspan_H_1B_cap_would_make_U.S._workers_privileged_elite_ |date=April 30, 2009|first=Patrick |last=Thibodeau |work=[[Computerworld]] |access-date=April 16, 2011}}</ref>

Greenspan discusses in his book, among other things, his history in government and economics, capitalism and other economic systems, current issues in the global economy, and future issues that face the global economy. In the book, Greenspan criticizes President George W. Bush, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], and the Republican-controlled Congress for abandoning the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s principles on spending and deficits. Greenspan's criticisms of President Bush include his refusal to veto spending bills, sending the country into increasingly deep deficits, and for "putting political imperatives ahead of sound economic policies".<ref name="TurbReuters">{{cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUKN1420623220070915 |title = Greenspan Criticizes Bush Policies in Memoir |first=Mark |last=Felsenthal |work=Reuters |date=September 15, 2007 |access-date= November 9, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194036/https://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUKN1420623220070915 |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Greenspan writes, "They swapped principle for power.

He asserts this would narrow the inequality between the minority of high-income earners and most workers whose wages have not grown in proportion with [[globalization]] and the nation's GDP growth.{{Sfn|Greenspan|2007|pp=392–408}}

==Objectivism==
{{obj}}
In the early 1950s, Greenspan began an association with novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]].<ref name="TurbRevKinsley">{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/books/review/Kinsley-t.html |title =Greenspan Shrugged |first=Michael |last=Kinsley |author-link=Michael Kinsley |work=The New York Times |date=October 14, 2007 |access-date=November 8, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124033522/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/books/review/Kinsley-t.html |archive-date=January 24, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Greenspan was introduced to Rand by his first wife, Joan Mitchell. Rand nicknamed Greenspan "the undertaker" because of his penchant for dark clothing and reserved demeanor. Although Greenspan was initially a [[logical positivist]],{{Sfn|Greenspan|2007|p=41}} he was converted to Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism]] by her associate [[Nathaniel Branden]]. He became one of the members of Rand's inner circle, [[the Ayn Rand Collective]], who read ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' while it was being written. During the 1950s and 1960s Greenspan was a proponent of Objectivism, writing articles for Objectivist newsletters and contributing several essays for Rand's 1966 book ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'' including an essay supporting the [[gold standard]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Greenspan |first=Alan |date=July 1966 |title=Gold and Economic Freedom |journal=[[The Objectivist]] |volume=5 |issue=7 |url=http://www.constitution.org/mon/greenspan_gold.htm |access-date=October 16, 2008 |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925231456/http://constitution.org/mon/greenspan_gold.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Harriet |last=Rubin |title= Ayn Rand's Literature of Capitalism |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html |work=The New York Times |date=September 15, 2007 |access-date=January 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316181158/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html |archive-date=March 16, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> During the 1960s Greenspan offered a ten-lecture course, "The Economics of a Free Society", under the auspices of the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]].

==Reception==

===Housing bubble===
In the wake of the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|subprime mortgage and credit crisis]] in 2007, Greenspan stated that there was a [[economic bubble|bubble]] in the U.S. housing market, warning in 2007 of "large double digit declines" in home values "larger than most people expect".<ref name="Greenspan admits bubble FT">{{cite news |first=Krishna |last=Guha |title= Greenspan Alert on US House Prices |date=September 17, 2007 |work=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/31207860-647f-11dc-90ea-0000779fd2ac.html |access-date=October 17, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921031032/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/31207860-647f-11dc-90ea-0000779fd2ac.html |archive-date=September 21, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Greenspan also noted, however, "I really didn't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006."<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark |last= Felsenthal |title= Greenspan Says Didn't See Subprime Storm Brewing |date=September 13, 2007 |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSWBT00756820070913 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref>

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] voted to reduce the [[federal funds rate]] from 3.5% to 3.0%.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/hh/2002/February/FullReport.txt |title = Monetary Policy Report to the Congress |date=February 27, 2002 |access-date=June 17, 2009 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090511163423/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/hh/2002/February/FullReport.txt |archive-date=May 11, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Then, after the [[accounting scandals]] of 2002, the Fed dropped the federal funds rate from then current 1.25% to 1.00%.<ref name=hearing>{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/jec/hearings/11-13-02.pdf |title=Economic Outlook Hearing before the Joint Economic Committee, Congress of the United States |date=November 13, 2002 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |access-date=June 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629181728/http://www.house.gov/jec/hearings/11-13-02.pdf |archive-date=June 29, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Greenspan stated that this drop in rates would have the effect of leading to a surge in home sales and refinancing, adding that "Besides sustaining the demand for new construction, mortgage markets have also been a powerful stabilizing force over the past two years of economic distress by facilitating the extraction of some of the equity that homeowners have built up over the years".<ref name=hearing/>

According to some, however, Greenspan's policies of adjusting interest rates to historic lows contributed to a housing bubble in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritholtz |first=Barry |title=Bailout Nation |url=https://archive.org/details/bailoutnationhow0000rith |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-52038-3}}</ref> The [[Federal Reserve]] acknowledged the connection between lower interest rates, higher home values, and the increased liquidity the higher home values bring to the overall economy: "Like other asset prices, house prices are influenced by interest rates, and in some countries, the housing market is a key channel of monetary policy transmission".<ref>{{cite report |url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2005/841/ifdp841.pdf |title= House Prices and Monetary Policy: A Cross-Country Study |first1= Alan G. |last1=Ahearne |first2=John |last2= Ammer |first3=Brian M. |last3=Doyle |first4=Linda S. |last4=Kole |first5=Robert F. |last5=Martin |date=September 2005 |publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System |name-list-style=amp}}</ref>

In 2008, Greenspan expressed great frustration that the February 23 speech was used to criticize him on ARMs and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], and stated that he had made countervailing comments eight days after it that praised traditional fixed-rate mortgages.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ip |first=Greg |title=His Legacy Tarnished, Greenspan Goes on Defensive |pages=A1 |work=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120760341392296107 |access-date=April 8, 2008 |date=April 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411225037/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120760341392296107.html |archive-date=April 11, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> In that speech, Greenspan had suggested that lenders should offer to home purchasers a greater variety of "mortgage product alternatives" other than traditional fixed-rate mortgages.<ref name="debt" /> Greenspan also praised the rise of the subprime mortgage industry and its tools for assessing credit-worthiness:
{{quote|text=Innovation has brought about a multitude of new products, such as subprime loans and niche credit programs for immigrants.

With these advances in technology, lenders have taken advantage of credit-scoring models and other techniques for efficiently extending credit to a broader spectrum of consumers.&nbsp;... Where once more-marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit, lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately. These improvements have led to rapid growth in subprime mortgage lending; indeed, today subprime mortgages account for roughly 10 percent of the number of all mortgages outstanding, up from just 1 or 2 percent in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite conference |title=Consumer Finance |first=Alan |last=Greenspan |conference=Federal Reserve System's Fourth Annual Community Affairs Research Conference |publisher=[[Federal Reserve Board]] |date=April 8, 2005 |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/speeches/2005/20050408/default.htm |access-date=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616124302/http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/speeches/2005/20050408/default.htm |archive-date=June 16, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>}}

The [[subprime lending|subprime]] mortgage industry collapsed in March 2007, with many of the largest lenders filing for bankruptcy protection in the face of spiraling foreclosure rates.

In September 2008 [[Joseph Stiglitz]] stated that Greenspan "didn't really believe in regulation; when the excesses of the financial system were noted, (he and others) called for self-regulation—an [[oxymoron]]".<ref>{{cite news|first=Joseph |last=Stiglitz |title=How to Prevent the Next Wall Street Crisis |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/17/stiglitz.crisis/ |work=CNN |date=September 17, 2008}}</ref> Greenspan, according to ''The New York Times'', says he himself is blameless.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jackie |last=Calmes |title=In Washington, Financial Furor Is a First-Rate Chance to Assess Blame |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/18cong.html |work=The New York Times |date=September 17, 2008 }}</ref> On April 6, 2005, Greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]]: "Appearing before the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Banking Committee]], the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the enormous portfolios of the companies—nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market—posed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face significant problems."<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/07/business/07fannie.html |work=The New York Times |title=Limits Urged in Mortgage Portfolios |date=April 7, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Labaton |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref> Despite this, Greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets, although in his 2007 biography he wrote, "History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low [[risk premium]]s" as seen before the credit crisis of 2008.

In 2009 [[Robert Reich]] wrote that "Greenspan's worst move was to contribute to the giant housing bubble and the worst worldwide crash since the [[Great Depression]]. In 2004 he lowered interest rates to 1%, enabling banks to borrow money for free, adjusted for inflation. Naturally, the banks wanted to borrow as much as they possibly could, then lend it out, earning nice profits. The situation screamed for government oversight of lending institutions, lest the banks lend to unfit borrowers. He refused, trusting the market to weed out bad credit risks. It did not."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/17/george-bush-alan-greenspan |title= Alan Greenspan by Robert Reich |first=Robert |last=Reich |date=January 17, 2009 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=April 2, 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

In congressional testimony on October 23, 2008, Greenspan finally conceded error on regulation. ''The New York Times'' wrote, "a humbled Mr. Greenspan admitted that he had put too much faith in the self-correcting power of free markets and had failed to anticipate the self-destructive power of wanton mortgage lending&nbsp;... Mr. Greenspan refused to accept blame for the crisis but acknowledged that his belief in deregulation had been shaken". Although many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawmakers tried to blame the housing bubble on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Greenspan placed far more blame on Wall Street for bundling subprime mortgages into securities.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/economy/24panel.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 23, 2008 |title=Greenspan Concedes Error on Regulation |last=Andrews |first=Edmund L. |access-date=February 16, 2010 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090410151942/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/economy/24panel.html |archive-date=April 10, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Late 2000s recession===
In March 2008, Greenspan wrote an article for the ''[[Financial Times]]''{{'}} Economists' Forum in which he said that the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2008-financial crisis]] in the United States is likely to be judged as the most wrenching since the end of [[World War&nbsp;II]]. In it he argued: "We will never be able to anticipate all discontinuities in financial markets." He concluded: "It is important, indeed crucial, that any reforms in, and adjustments to, the structure of markets and regulation not inhibit our most reliable and effective safeguards against cumulative economic failure: market flexibility and open competition." The article attracted a number of critical responses from forum contributors, who, finding causation between Greenspan's policies and the discontinuities in financial markets that followed, criticized Greenspan mainly for what many believed to be his unbalanced and immovable ideological suppositions about global capitalism and free competitive markets. Notable critics included [[J.&nbsp;Bradford DeLong]], [[Paul Krugman]], [[Alice Rivlin]], [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]], and [[Willem Buiter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2008/03/we-will-never-have-a-perfect-model-of-risk/ |title=We will never have a perfect model of risk |work=Financial Times|last=Greenspan |first=Alan |date=March 17, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref>

Greenspan responded to his critics in a follow-up article in which he defended his ideology as applied to his conceptual and policy framework, which, among other things, prohibited him from exerting real pressure against the burgeoning housing bubble or, in his words, "leaning against the wind". Greenspan argued, "My view of the range of dispersion of outcomes has been shaken, but not my judgment that free competitive markets are by far the unrivaled way to organize economies". He concluded: "We have tried regulation ranging from heavy to central planning. None meaningfully worked. Do we wish to retest the evidence?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2008/04/alan-greenspan-a-response-to-my-critics |title=A response to my critics |work= Financial Times|last=Greenspan |first=Alan |date=April 6, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref> ''Financial Times'' associate editor and chief economics commentator [[Martin Wolf]] defended Greenspan primarily as a scapegoat for the market turmoil. Several notable contributors in defense of Greenspan included [[Stephen S. Roach]], [[Allan Meltzer]], and Robert Brusca.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6c50fef0-056a-11dd-a9e0-0000779fd2ac.html |first=Martin |last=Wolf |title=Why Greenspan Does Not Bear Most of the Blame |work=Financial Times |date=April 8, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref>

However, an October 15, 2008, article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' analyzing the origins of the economic crisis claims that Greenspan vehemently opposed any regulation of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], and actively sought to undermine the office of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] when the commission sought to initiate regulation of derivatives. Meanwhile, Greenspan recommended improving mark-to-market regulations to avoid having derivatives or other complex assets marked to a distressed or illiquid market during times of material adverse conditions seen during the late 2000s credit crisis.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Went Wrong |first1=Anthony |last1=Faiola |first2=Ellen |last2=Nakashima |first3=Jill |last3=Drew |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101403343.html |date=October 15, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |page=A01 |name-list-style=amp}}</ref>

Greenspan was not alone in his opposition to derivatives regulation. In a 1999 government report that was a key driver in the passage of the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]]—legislation that clarified that most [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] derivatives were outside the regulatory authority of any government agency—Greenspan was joined by Treasury Secretary [[Lawrence Summers]], [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] Chairman [[Arthur Levitt]], and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman William Ranier in concluding that "under many circumstances, the trading of financial derivatives by eligible swap participants should be excluded from the CEA" ([[Commodity Exchange Act]]). Other government agencies also supported that view.<ref name=PWG>{{cite report |first1=Lawrence |last1=Summers |first2=Alan |last2=Greenspan |first3=Arthur |last3=Levitt |first4=William |last4=Ranier |title= Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act: Report of The President's Working Group on Financial Markets |date=November 1999 |url= http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/otcact.pdf |access-date=August 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825004934/http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/otcact.pdf |archive-date=August 25, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In Congressional testimony on October 23, 2008, Greenspan acknowledged that he was "partially" wrong in opposing regulation and stated "Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity—myself especially—are in a state of shocked disbelief."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-10-24/greenspan-admits-some-guilt-over-financial-crisis/551992|title=Greenspan admits some guilt over financial crisis|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=October 24, 2008|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: "I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact." When Representative [[Henry Waxman]] (D-CA) pressed him to clarify his words. "In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working," Waxman said. "Absolutely, precisely", Greenspan replied. "You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well."<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |url= https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/greenspans-mea-culpa/|title=Greenspan's Mea Culpa |work=The New York Times |author= David Leonhardt |date=October 23, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621063537/https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/greenspans-mea-culpa/ |archive-date=June 21, 2009 |url-status=live|author-link=David Leonhardt }}</ref> Greenspan admitted fault<ref name="The Monthly">{{cite web |url=http://themonthly.com.au/node/1785/page/1 |title=Comment: The Corporate Fallacy |work= The Monthly |first=Noel |last=Pearson |date=July 2009}}</ref> in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn't protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.

[[Matt Taibbi]] described the [[Greenspan put]] and its bad consequences saying: "every time the banks blew up a speculative bubble, they could go back to the Fed and borrow money at zero or one or two percent, and then start the game all over", thereby making it "almost impossible" for the banks to lose money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2011/2/22/matt_taibbi_why_isnt_wall_street_in_jail|title=Matt Taibbi: "Why Isn't Wall Street in Jail?"

In the documentary film ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'', Greenspan is cited as one of the persons responsible for the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. He is also named in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] as one of the "25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1877351,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414072623/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1877351,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 14, 2009 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Complete List&nbsp;– 25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis |access-date=May 1, 2013}}</ref>

===Political views and alleged politicization of office===
Greenspan describes himself as a "lifelong [[libertarian Republican]]".<ref name="TurbWSJ" />

In March 2005, in reaction to Greenspan's support of President Bush's plan to [[Social Security debate (United States)|partially privatize]] [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], then-Democratic Senate Minority Leader [[Harry Reid]] attacked Greenspan as "one of the biggest political hacks we have in Washington"<ref name="washtime"/> and criticized him for supporting Bush's 2001 tax cut plan.<ref name="Andrews"/> Then-Democratic House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] added that there were serious questions about the Fed's independence as a result of Greenspan's public statements.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,149556,00.html |title=Transcript: Nancy Pelosi on 'FOX News Sunday' |work=Fox News |date=March 6, 2005 |access-date=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727180040/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,149556,00.html |archive-date=July 27, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Greenspan also received criticism from Democratic Congressman [[Barney Frank]] and others for supporting Bush's Social Security plans favoring private accounts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,147972,00.html |title=Greenspan Supports 'Ownership' Concept in Social Security |work=Fox News |date=February 17, 2005 |access-date=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728051810/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,147972,00.html |archive-date=July 28, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5396-2005Mar3.html |title=Senate Democratic Leader Blasts Greenspan |work= The Washington Post |first=Dan |last=Balz |date=March 4, 2005 |page=A06 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/barney-frank-sa.html |title=Barney Frank Says Race a Factor in Subprime Blame Game |work=Political Punch |first=Jake |last=Tapper |date=October 7, 2008 |publisher=ABC News |access-date=June 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108150044/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/barney-frank-sa.html |archive-date=November 8, 2009}}</ref> Greenspan had said Bush's model has "the seeds of developing full funding by its very nature.

Others, like Republican Senator [[Mitch McConnell]], disagreed that Greenspan was too deferential to Bush, stating that Greenspan "has been an independent player at the Fed for a long time under both parties and made an enormous positive contribution".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7108135 |work=Meet the Press |title=Transcript for March&nbsp;6 |publisher=NBC News |date=March 6, 2005 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref>

Economist Paul Krugman wrote that Greenspan was a "three-card maestro" with a "lack of sincerity" who, "by repeatedly shilling for whatever the Bush administration wants, has betrayed the trust placed in the Fed chairman".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/18/opinion/18krugman.html |title=Three-card Maestro |first=Paul |last=Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=February 18, 2005 |access-date=November 10, 2007}}</ref>
