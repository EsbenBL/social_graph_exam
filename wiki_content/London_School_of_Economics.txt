=== 20th century ===
The school joined the federal [[University of London]] in 1900, and was recognised as a Faculty of Economics of the university. The University of London degrees of [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] (Econ) and [[Doctor of Science|DSc]] (Econ) were established in 1901, the first university degrees dedicated to the social sciences.<ref name="LSEHistory1895" /> Expanding rapidly over the following years, the school moved initially to the nearby 10 Adelphi Terrace, then to Clare Market and Houghton Street. The foundation stone of the Old Building, on Houghton Street, was laid by [[George V|King George V]] in 1920;<ref name="LSEHistoryAbout" /> the building was opened in 1922.<ref name="LSEHistory1895" />

[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[Friedrich Hayek]], who taught at LSE during the 1930s and 1940s]]
The 1930s economic debate between LSE and Cambridge is well known in academic circles. Rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's [[Edwin Cannan]] (1861–1935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, [[Alfred Marshall]] (1842–1924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)<ref>Dahrendorf (1995), p.210-213</ref>

The dispute also concerned the question of the economist's role, and whether this should be as a detached expert or a practical adviser.<ref>Gerard Loot, cited in Dahrendorf (1995), P.212</ref> Despite the traditional view that the LSE and Cambridge were fierce rivals through the 1920s and 30s, they worked together in the 1920s on the London and Cambridge Economic Service.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/41/1/307/2625390/The-London-and-Cambridge-Economic-Service-history?redirectedFrom=fulltext|title=The London and Cambridge Economic Service: history and contributions|author=Robert A. Cord|doi=10.1093/cje/bew020|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics |date=2016|volume= 41|issue=1|pages=307–326}}</ref> However, the 1930s brought a return to disputes as economists at the two universities argued over how best to address the economic problems caused by the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=CambDebate>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/embed/index.html?source=0Ah9w-9lcqZALdHdTbmF2MS1iYmtVdmlpX3A5N2VPc0E&font=Georgia-Helvetica&maptype=toner&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&amp%20-%200#33|title=Debate with Cambridge|work=LSE timeline 1895–1995|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>

The main figures in this debate were [[John Maynard Keynes]] from Cambridge and the LSE's [[Friedrich Hayek]]. The LSE Economist [[Lionel Robbins]] was also heavily involved. Starting off as a disagreement over whether demand management or deflation was the better solution to the economic problems of the time, it eventually embraced much wider concepts of economics and macroeconomics. Keynes put forward the theories now known as [[Keynesian economics]], involving the active participation of the state and public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the [[Austrian School]], which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.<ref name=CambDebate/>

During World War II, the school decamped from London to the [[University of Cambridge]], occupying buildings belonging to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album/hostel/hostel_03.jpg |title=Peterhouse Images |publisher=Peterhouse, Cambridge |access-date=23 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529001601/http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album%2Fhostel%2Fhostel_03.jpg |archive-date=29 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

LSE continues to have a wide impact within British society, through its relationships and influence in politics, business and law. ''[[The Guardian]]'' described such influence in 2005 when it stated:
<blockquote>Once again the political clout of the school, which seems to be closely wired into parliament, Whitehall and the Bank of England, is being felt by ministers.... The strength of LSE is that it is close to the political process: [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]], was a former LSE professor. The former chairman of the House of Commons education committee, [[Barry Sheerman]], sits on its board of governors, along with Labour peer [[Frank Judd, Baron Judd|Lord (Frank) Judd]]. Also on the board are Tory MPs [[Virginia Bottomley]] and [[Richard Shepherd]], as well as [[Maurice Saatchi, Baron Saatchi|Lord Saatchi]] and [[Elspeth Howe, Baroness Howe of Idlicote|Lady Howe]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/columnist/story/0,,1515788,00.html |title=A Time Honoured Tradition a|work=The Guardian | location=London | date=27 June 2005 | access-date=4 April 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Commenting in 2001 on the rising status of the LSE, the British magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' stated that "two decades ago the LSE was still the poor relation of the University of London's other colleges. Now... it regularly follows Oxford and Cambridge in league tables of research output and teaching quality and is at least as well-known abroad as Oxbridge". According to the magazine, the school "owes its success to the single-minded, American-style exploitation of its brand name and political connections by the recent directors, particularly Mr [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] and his predecessor, [[John Ashworth (biologist)|John Ashworth]]" and raises money from foreign students' high fees, which are attracted by academic stars such as [[Richard Sennett]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/687641 |title=The brain trade |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=5 July 2001 |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref>

A sculpture by [[Mark Wallinger]], ''[[The World Turned Upside Down (sculpture)|The World Turned Upside Down]]'', which features a globe resting on its north pole, was installed in Sheffield Street on the LSE campus on 26 March 2019.

==Campus and estate==
[[File:LSE main entrance.jpg|thumb|Old Building|left]]
[[File:Centre Building, LSE from LSE Square.jpg|thumb|Centre Building, opened in 2019]]
Since 1902, LSE has been based at [[Clare Market]] and Houghton Street in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]]. It is surrounded by a number of important institutions including the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], all four [[Inns of Court]]s, [[Royal College of Surgeons]], [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], and the [[West End of London|West End]] is immediately across [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]] from campus, which also borders the [[City of London]] and is within walking distance to [[Trafalgar Square]] and the [[Houses of Parliament]].

[[File:The Land Registry Offices, Lincoln Inn Fields.jpg|thumb|[[32 Lincoln's Inn Fields]] houses the Department of Economics and the [[International Growth Centre]]]]
In 1920, [[George V|King George V]] laid the foundation of the Old Building. The campus now occupies an almost continuous group of around 30 buildings between [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]] and the [[Aldwych]]. Alongside teaching and academic space, the institution also owns 11 student halls of residence across London, a West End theatre (the [[Peacock Theatre|Peacock]]), early years centre, [[National Health Service|NHS]] medical centre and extensive sports ground in Berrylands, south London. LSE operates the George IV public house<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/catering/outlets|title=Restaurants and cafes on campus|website=info.lse.ac.uk|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> and the students' union operates the Three Tuns bar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food and drink|url=https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/estates-division/facilities-guide/food-and-drink|access-date=26 May 2021|website=London School of Economics and Political Science}}</ref> The school's campus is noted for its numerous public art installations which include [[Richard Wilson (sculptor)|Richard Wilson]]'s ''Square the Block'',<ref>{{cite web|title=LSE unveils new Richard Wilson sculpture, Square the Block|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/website-archive/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/09/RichardWilson.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719131847/http://www.lse.ac.uk/website-archive/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/09/RichardWilson.aspx|archive-date=19 July 2020|access-date=8 December 2013|website=London School of Economics and Political Science|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref> Michael Brown's ''Blue Rain'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Blue Rain at LSE|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/08/Bluerain.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212040015/http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/08/Bluerain.aspx|archive-date=12 December 2013|access-date=8 December 2013|website=London School of Economics and Political Science|publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science}}</ref> [[Christopher Le Brun]]'s ''Desert Window''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stained Glass Window: Christopher Le Brun's Sacred Desert Window|url=https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/Faith-Centre/Faith-Centre-Spaces/Stained-Glass-WIndow|access-date=26 May 2021|website=London School of Economics and Political Science|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref>

Since the early 2000s, the entire campus has undergone an extensive refurbishment project and a major fund-raising "Campaign for LSE" raised over £100 million in what was one of the largest university fund-raising exercises outside North America.  This process was begun with the £35 million renovation of the Lionel Robbins Building by [[Norman Foster|Sir Norman Foster]] to house the [[British Library of Political and Economic Science]] (BLPES), the world's largest social science library and the second largest single entity library in Britain, after the British Library at King's Cross.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/library/guides/VisitorsLibraryGuide.pdf |title=Visitors' Library Guide |publisher=London School of Economics |date=12 May 2010 |access-date=23 October 2011 |archive-date=27 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327092321/http://www.lse.ac.uk/library/guides/VisitorsLibraryGuide.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:NABuilding.JPG|thumb|right|The New Academic Building houses the Departments of Management and Law]]
In 2003, LSE purchased the former Public Trustee building at 24 Kingsway, and engaged [[Nicholas Grimshaw|Sir Nicholas Grimshaw]] to redesign it into an ultra-modern educational facility at a total cost of over £45&nbsp;million – increasing the size of the campus by {{convert|120000|sqft|m2}}.

===Saw Swee Hock Student Centre===
The first new building on the site for more than 40 years, the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre opened in January 2014 following an [[architectural design competition]] managed by [[RIBA Competitions]].

=== Sustainability ===
As of the 2021-2 academic year, LSE [[Carbon offset|offsets the emissions]] it measures by funding rainforest trees<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-11-04|title=LSE becomes first carbon-neutral university|language=en-GB|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-59153034|access-date=2021-11-05}}</ref>.

==Organisation and administration==

===Governance===
Although LSE is a constituent college of the federal University of London, it is in many ways comparable with free-standing, self-governing and independently funded universities, and it awards its own degrees.

LSE is incorporated under the [[Companies Act]] as a company limited by guarantee and is an exempt charity within the meaning of Schedule Two of the [[Charities Act 1993]].<ref name="annrep">{{cite web|title=Financial statements|url=https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Finance-Division/annual-accounts/financial-statements|access-date=27 May 2021|website=London School of Economics and Political Science|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref> The principal governance bodies of the LSE are: the LSE Council; the Court of Governors; the academic board; and the director and director's management team.<ref name=annrep/>

The LSE Council is responsible for strategy and its members are company directors of the school. It has specific responsibilities in relation to areas including: the monitoring of institutional performance; finance and financial sustainability; audit arrangements; estate strategy; human resource and employment policy; health and safety; "educational character and mission", and student experience. The council is supported in carrying out its role by a number of committees that report directly to it.<ref name=annrep/>

The Court of Governors deals with certain constitutional matters and has pre-decision discussions on key policy issues and the involvement of individual governors in the school's activities. The court has the following formal powers: the appointment of members of court, its subcommittees and of the council; election of the chair and vice chairs of the court and council and honorary fellows of the school; the amendment of the memorandum and articles of association; and the appointment of external auditors.<ref name=annrep/>

The academic board is LSE's principal academic body, and considers all major issues of general policy affecting the academic life of the school and its development.

===Finances===
The LSE group has an endowment (as of 31 July 2016) of £119M and had a total income for 2015–16 (excluding donations and endowments) of £311M (£293M in 2014–15) with expenditure of £307M (2014–15 £302M). Key sources of income included £177M from tuition fees and education contacts (2014–15 £167M), £25M from funding council grants (2014–15 £22M), £32M from research grants (2014–15 – £27M) and £5.3M from investment income (2014–15 £4.7M).<ref name="financial statement 2016">{{cite web|title=Financial Statements|url=https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Finance-Division/annual-accounts/financial-statements|access-date=27 May 2021|website=London School of Economics and Political Science|publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science}}</ref>

The [[Times Higher Education]] Pay Survey 2017 revealed that, among larger, non-specialist institutions, LSE professors and academics were the highest paid in the UK, with average incomes of £103,886 and £65,177 respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/times-higher-education-pay-survey-2017|title= Times Higher Education Pay Survey 2017|date=4 May 2017|author=Simon Baker|work=Times Higher Education}}</ref>

====Endowment====

The London School of Economics (LSE) is aiming to increase the size of its endowment fund to more than £1bn, which would make it one of the best resourced institutions in the UK and the world. The effort was initiated in 2016 by Lord Myners, then chairman of the LSE's Council and Court of Governors. The plan includes working with wealthy alumni of LSE to make large contributions, increasing the annual budget surplus, and launching a new, widescale alumni donor campaign. The plan to grow LSE's endowment to more than £1bn has been continued by Lord Myners' successors at the LSE.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/83554b84-a8a9-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879 |title=LSE looks to boost endowment fund to £1bn |website=Financial Times |date=4 January 2016 |access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref> The LSE has stated that currently "limited endowment funding constrains our ability to offer 'needs blind' admission to students".<ref name="financial statement 2016"/>

===Academic year===
LSE continues to adopt a three-term structure and has not moved to semesters. [[Michaelmas Term]] runs from October to mid-December, [[Lent Term]] from mid-January to late March and Summer Term from late April to mid-June.  Certain departments operate reading weeks in early November and mid-February.<ref>{{cite web|title=Term dates|url=https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/term-dates|access-date=27 May 2021|website=London School of Economics and Political Science}}</ref>

===Logo, arms and mascot===
[[File:LSE_Logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|LSE's "red block" logo]]
The school's historic coat of arms is used on official documentation including degree certificates and transcripts and includes the motto – ''rerum cognoscere causas'', a line taken from [[Virgil]]’s ''[[Georgics]]'' meaning "to know the causes of things", together with the school's mascot – a [[beaver]]. Both these symbols, adopted in February 1922, continue to be held in high regard to this day with the beaver chosen because of its representation as "a hard working and industrious yet sociable animal", attributes that the founders hoped LSE students to both possess and aspire to.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/studentsatlse/2012/10/25/guest-blog-the-lse-beaver/ |title=Guest Blog: The LSE Beaver &#124; Students@LSE |website=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=25 October 2012 |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref> The school's weekly newspaper is still entitled ''The Beaver'', Rosebery residence hall's bar is called the Tipsy Beaver and LSE sports teams are known as the Beavers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lsesu.com/activities/sports/clubs/7708/ |title=Basketball – Men's |website=Lsesu.com |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref> The institution has two sets of colours – brand and academic – red being the brand colour used on signage, publications and in buildings across campus and purple, black and gold for academic purposes including presentation ceremonies and graduation dress.

LSE's present 'red block' logo was adopted as part of a rebrand in the early 2000s, before which the school's coat of arms was used exclusively to represent the institution. As a trademarked brand, it is carefully protected but can be produced in various forms to reflect different requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/policies/pdfs/school/guiHouSty.pdf |title=GUIDANCE ON LSE HOUSE STYLE AND BEST COMMUNICATIONS PRACTICE |website=Lse.ac.uk |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref>  In its full form it contains the full name of the institution to the right of the block with a further small empty red square at the end, but it is adapted for each academic department or professional service division to provide a cohesive brand across the institution.

The [[LSE Students' Union]] (LSESU) is affiliated to the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] and is responsible for campaigning and lobbying the school on behalf of students as well providing student support and the organisation and undertaking of entertainment events and student societies. It is often regarded as the most politically active in Britain – a reputation it has held since the well documented LSE student riots in 1966–67 and 1968–69,<ref>{{cite news |title=LSE Student Protests |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6299579.stm | date=31 May 2007 | access-date=6 January 2010 |work=BBC News | first=Lucy | last=Wilkins}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=On This Day – LSE Student Protests | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/13/newsid_2542000/2542639.stm | date=13 March 1967 | access-date=6 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref> which made international headlines. In 2015, the school was awarded the top spot for student nightlife by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/07/london-school-of-economics-best-university-nightlife |title=The London School of Economics: why is it the best uni for nightlife? |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref> due in part to its central location and provision of over 200 societies, 40 sports clubs, a Raising and Giving (RAG) branch and a thriving media group. In 2013, the union moved into a purpose-built new building – the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre on the Aldwych campus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Saw Swee Hock Student Centre|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/students/campusLondonLife/sweeHockStudentCentre/Home.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212035508/http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/students/campusLondonLife/sweeHockStudentCentre/Home.aspx|archive-date=12 December 2013|access-date=9 December 2013|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref>

== LSE in literature and other media ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2021}}
The LSE has been mentioned and formed the basis of setting for numerous works of fiction and in popular culture.

The first notable mention of the LSE was in literature was in the epilogue to [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw's]] 1912 play '[[Pygmalion (play)|'Pygmalion]]', Eliza Dolittle is sent to the LSE.

In around a dozen other novels, the LSE was mentioned as short-hand for a character being witty and clever but outside the establishment. This is best exhibited by [[Ian Fleming]]'s CV of James Bond that included the detail that his father, Andrew, is an LSE graduate. These occurrences have continued into contemporary fiction: Lenny is the young ‘hip’ LSE graduate and criminologist in [[Jake Arnott]]’s tour of the London underworld in ''[[The Long Firm]].'' Robert Harris’ ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' includes Baxter, a code breaker with leftist views, who has been an LSE lecturer before the war and ''My Revolutions''  by [[Hari Kunzru]] traces the career of Chris Carver aka Michael Frame who travels from LSE student radical to terrorist and on to middle England.

Former LSE alumnus [[Hilary Mantel]] in ''The Experience of Love'' never mentions LSE by name but [[Holborn|Houghton Street]], the corridors of the [[LSE Old Building]] and Wright's Bar are immediately recognisable references to the campus of the school. [[A. S. Byatt|A.S Byatt]]’s ''[[The Children's Book|The Children’s Book]]'' returns to LSE’s Fabian roots with a plot inspired in part by the life of children’s writer E Nesbitt and Fabian Hubert Bland, and characters that choose LSE over older educational establishments (namely [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]).

On the small screen, the popular 1980s British sitcom [[Yes Minister]] and [[Yes, Prime Minister|Yes Prime Minister]] make a regular references to the LSE with Minister [[Jim Hacker]] (later Prime Minister) and Sir Mark Spencer (special advisor to the Prime Minister) regularly being subtly ridiculed for having attended the LSE.  A slightly earlier fictional LSE graduate appears in season three episode six of the US series, ''[[Mad Men (season 3)|Mad Men]]''. The popular American series ''[[The West Wing]]'' following the Democratic administration of [[Josiah Bartlet|Josiah (Jed) Barltet]] makes several references to Josiah Bartlet being an alumnus of the LSE. Other fictional LSE alumnus are present in ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'', at least one episode of ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]'' and ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'' series. 

In movies and motion pictures, in the 2014 action spy thriller ''[[Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit|Shadow Recruit]]'', the young Jack Ryan, based on a Tom Clancy character, proves his academic credentials by walking out of the Old Building as he graduates from the London School of Economics before injuring his spine being shot down in Afghanistan. The LSE is acknowledged in [[The Social Network]] naming the institution along with [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] Universities in a reference to the rapid growth [[Facebook]] enjoyed both within and outside the United States in its early years.
