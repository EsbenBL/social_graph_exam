== Biography ==
Baddeley was born in [[Leeds]], Yorkshire on 23 March 1934.<ref>https://books.google.ca/books?id=uJFGAQAAIAAJ&q=Alan+Baddeley+1934+leeds&dq=Alan+Baddeley+1934+leeds&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjq2rDnt7DPAhVMzoMKHYRjAQcQ6AEIOTAF {{ISBN missing}}</ref> He lived there with his parents, Donald and Nellie Baddeley, until leaving for university.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Baddeley|first=Alan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TiBtDwAAQBAJ&q=alan+baddeley+family&pg=PT19|title=Working Memories: Postmen, Divers and the Cognitive Revolution|date=2018-09-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-23852-2|language=en}}</ref> He decided to study psychology and was originally interested in [[psychoanalysis]]. Later he changed his focus to evidence-based psychology.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview with Alan Baddeley {{!}} The Psychologist|url=https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-5/interview-alan-baddeley|access-date=2020-07-02|website=thepsychologist.bps.org.uk}}</ref> In 1956, Baddeley went to the United States of America to continue his studies. After spending a year in America, he returned home. He then went to Cambridge, where he met and married Hilary Ann White. Baddeley and his wife have three sons.<ref name=":0" />

Baddeley has taught and conducted research at [[University of Sussex]], [[University of Stirling]], MRC Applied Psychology Unit, [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Bristol]].

==Education==

He then obtained an MA from [[Princeton University]]'s [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]] in 1957.  He earned a PhD from [[University of Cambridge]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|title=Measures and measurements in stochastic geometry|first= Alan David|last=Baddeley|date=1981|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.237649|oclc=556713452}}</ref> He has been awarded Honorary Doctorates by [[University of Essex]] in 1999,<ref>University of Essex, "Honorary Graduates" http://www.essex.ac.uk/honorary_graduates/hg/default.aspx#1999 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019214719/http://www.essex.ac.uk/honorary_graduates/hg/default.aspx |date=19 October 2013 }} retrieved March 2013</ref> [[Plymouth University]] in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web|title=University of Plymouth honorary doctorates|url=https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/about-us/about-us/honorary-doctorates|date=2000|website=University of Plymouth honorary doctorates|access-date=May 13, 2020}}</ref> and [[University of Bristol]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bristol|first=University of|title=Alan Baddley is unknown {{!}} Graduation {{!}} University of Bristol|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-degrees/honorary-graduates-2019/alan-baddeley/|access-date=2020-07-02|website=www.bris.ac.uk|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Career and research==
In 1974, working with [[Graham Hitch]], Baddeley developed an influential model of [[working memory]] called [[Baddeley's model of working memory]],<ref name=":1">{{Citation|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan D.|title=Working Memory|date=1974-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742108604521|work=Psychology of Learning and Motivation|volume=8|pages=47–89|editor-last=Bower|editor-first=Gordon H.|publisher=Academic Press|language=en|access-date=2020-07-03|last2=Hitch|first2=Graham}}</ref> which argues for the existence of multiple short-term memory stores and a separate interacting system for manipulating the content of these stores. There are three components of this model: the phonological loop, the central executive, and the visuospatial sketch pad.<ref name=":1" /> In 2000, Baddeley suggested adding a fourth component to his memory model called the episodic buffer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baddeley|first=Alan|date=2000-11-01|title=The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory?|url=https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(00)01538-2|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=4|issue=11|pages=417–423|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2|issn=1364-6613|pmid=11058819|s2cid=14333234}}</ref>The model accounts for much of the empirical data on short-term retention and manipulation of information.

His landmark study in 1975 on the capacity of short term memory<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan D.|last2=Thomson|first2=Neil|last3=Buchanan|first3=Mary|date=1975-12-01|title=Word length and the structure of short-term memory|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022537175800454|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|language=en|volume=14|issue=6|pages=575–589|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(75)80045-4|issn=0022-5371}}</ref> showed that people remembered more short words than long words in a recall test. This was called the word length effect and it demonstrated that pronunciation time rather than number of items determines the capacity of verbal short-term memory. This study also found that when participants repeated an irrelevant sound while reading the words, the world length effect does not happen.<ref name=":2" />

Working with [[Barbara Wilson (psychologist)|Barbara Wilson]], Baddeley also did several important studies on amnesia and memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan|last2=Wilson|first2=Barbara|date=1988-04-01|title=Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive syndrome|journal=Brain and Cognition|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=212–230|doi=10.1016/0278-2626(88)90031-0|pmid=3377900|s2cid=26954876|issn=0278-2626}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan|last2=Wilson|first2=Barbara A.|date=2002-01-01|title=Prose recall and amnesia: implications for the structure of working memory|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393201001464|journal=Neuropsychologia|language=en|volume=40|issue=10|pages=1737–1743|doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00146-4|pmid=11992661|s2cid=22404837|issn=0028-3932}}</ref> They studied patients with temporal lobe damage that caused memory problems. Results of such studies provide evidence that short-term and long-term memory are not one system. The amnesia patients had normal short-term memory but impaired long-term memory.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Baddeley|first=Alan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LA0DwAAQBAJ&q=alan+baddeley&pg=PT12|title=Exploring Working Memory: Selected works of Alan Baddeley|date=2017-09-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-61852-6|language=en}}</ref>
