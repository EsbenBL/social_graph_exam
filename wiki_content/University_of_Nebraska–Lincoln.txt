The '''University of Nebraska–Lincoln''' ('''Nebraska''', '''UNL''', or '''NU''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[research university]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]. It is the state's oldest university and the [[flagship institution]] of the [[University of Nebraska system]].

The state legislature chartered the university in 1869 as a land-grant university under the 1862 [[Morrill Act]], two years after Nebraska became a state. At the turn of the 20th century, the university expanded significantly, hiring professors from eastern schools to teach its new [[Professional schools|professional programs]] and conducting groundbreaking research in agricultural sciences. The "Nebraska method" of ecological study developed during this time pioneered grassland ecology and laid the foundation for research in [[theoretical ecology]] for the rest of the century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vandervoort|first=Frances|year=1999|title=A Green Centennial|journal=The American Biology Teacher|publisher=University of California|volume=61|issue=9|pages=648–659|jstor=4450796|doi=10.2307/4450796}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Merchant|first=Carolyn|title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcdo0qlS0awC|access-date=September 9, 2010|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=Manhattan, NY|isbn=978-0-231-11233-8|pages=163–164|chapter=Chapter 9: The Rise of Ecology 1890–1990}}</ref>

==History==
The University of Nebraska was created by an act of the [[Nebraska Legislature|Nebraska state legislature]] in 1869, two years after [[Nebraska]] was admitted into the Union as the 37th state. The law described the new university's aims: "The object of such institution shall be to afford to the inhabitants of the state the means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the various branches of literature, science, and the arts."<ref>Pound, Louise. ''Semi-centennial Anniversary Book.'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. 1919. p. 14.</ref> The school received an initial land grant of about {{convert|130000|acre|ha}} through the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]]. Campus construction began in September 1869 with University Hall at 11th and S Streets, and two years later the University welcomed its inaugural class of 20 collegiate students along with 110 preparatory students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-nebraskahistory.org/index.php?title=Nebraska_Historical_Marker:_The_University_of_Nebraska|title=Nebraska Historical Marker: The University of Nebraska|publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=October 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024204426/http://www.e-nebraskahistory.org/index.php?title=Nebraska_Historical_Marker:_The_University_of_Nebraska|archive-date=October 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> By 1873, the University of Nebraska had offered its first two degrees to its inaugural graduating class.<ref>Pound, Louise. ''Semi-centennial Anniversary Book.'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. 1919. pp. 11–19.</ref> The school's enrollment and budget remained relatively small until about 20 years after its founding, when its high school programs were taken over by a new state education system. From 1890 to 1895 enrollment rose from 384 to about 1,500. Shortly after, a law school and a graduate school were created, the latter making NU the first university west of the [[Mississippi River]] to establish a graduate school.<ref>The first school west of the Mississippi River to issue a graduate degree was [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. UNL was the first school in the region to formally organize a school for graduates.

Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1995. pp. 38–39. {{ISBN|0-8032-2717-5}}</ref> Around this time, NU founded several noteworthy campus organizations, including [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|a football team]], a debate team, and its first fraternities and sororities.<ref>Knoll, Robert.

The issue was not resolved until a statewide referendum decided the school would remain at its current location. After purchasing property in the downtown area, the school funded several new buildings, both on the new property and its farming campus in east Lincoln. The school would not experience another expansion of this magnitude until the late 1940s, when the sudden arrival of thousands of soldiers seeking education after returning from [[World War II]] forced the school to seek further expansion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historicbuildings.unl.edu/overview.html |title=UNL Historic Buildings - Historical Overview |publisher=Historicbuildings.unl.edu |access-date=2012-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708185637/http://historicbuildings.unl.edu/overview.html |archive-date=July 8, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nebraska successfully retained its AAU membership after a 2000 challenge, which provided the school with an advantage when the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] was looking to expand in 2010, as all of its members at that time were AAU members.

In June 2018, the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) voted to censure the university for violations of academic freedom. In 2017, an adjunct instructor was filmed by a student as the instructor expressed a political opinion about the student's activist activities. State lawmakers demanded that the university hold the instructor accountable and the university subsequently fired her, a move the AAUP contends was a violation of her academic freedom.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/06/18/aaup-votes-censure-u-nebraska-alleged-violations-academic-freedom-courtney-lawton |title=AAUP Censure for Nebraska |first=Colleen |last=Flaherty |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=June 18, 2018 |access-date=June 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618122715/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/06/18/aaup-votes-censure-u-nebraska-alleged-violations-academic-freedom-courtney-lawton |archive-date=June 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1869, the original University of Nebraska campus was laid out on four city blocks and comprised one building called University Hall. Currently, the university has three campuses, totaling {{convert|2815|acre|ha}}: City Campus, north of downtown Lincoln; Nebraska Innovation Campus, just northeast of City Campus on the old [[Nebraska State Fair]] grounds; and East Campus, one mile east of City Campus.

Both City and East campuses include academic and research facilities, libraries, recreation centers, and residential buildings. They both feature various support buildings for power and networking, as well as in-ground infrastructure supporting advanced computing, power distribution, and energy-efficient heating and cooling from central plants. Both campuses are heavily landscaped, with the grounds functioning as a research mission of the university; they are administered as the UNL Botanical Garden and Arboretum,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unl.edu/bga/|title=Botanical Garden and Arboretum|access-date=June 26, 2017|publisher=University of Nebraska|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222947/http://www.unl.edu/bga/|archive-date=June 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> which handles major plantings including Cather Garden on City Campus and Maxwell Arboretum on East Campus.

In January 2010, the university acquired a {{convert|249|acre|ha|adj=on}} property northeast of City Campus that had been used to host the Nebraska State Fair. Plans for redevelopment included a US$800 million expansion to house agricultural biotechnology and other life science research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/education/article_00bde850-d5f8-11de-bfe2-001cc4c002e0.html|title=University of Nebraska Board of Regents approve Innovation Campus|access-date=August 2, 2011|publisher=JournalStar.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225022353/http://journalstar.com/news/local/education/article_00bde850-d5f8-11de-bfe2-001cc4c002e0.html|archive-date=December 25, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2008/07/11/Nebraska+Innovation+Campus+ideas,++approaches+sought|title=Nebraska Innovation Campus|access-date=August 2, 2011|publisher=University of Nebraska–Lincoln|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095839/http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2008/07/11/Nebraska+Innovation+Campus+ideas,++approaches+sought|archive-date=July 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> This project resulted in the construction of [[Nebraska Innovation Campus]], a public/private research park located adjacent to the [[Bob Devaney Sports Center]].

{{Main|Nebraska Cornhuskers}}
[[File:Nebraska Cornhuskers logo.svg|thumb|100px|Nebraska Athletics logo]]
The Nebraska Cornhuskers (often abbreviated to Huskers) are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. The university is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and the Cornhuskers compete in [[NCAA Division I]], fielding 22 [[varsity team]]s (9 men's, 13 women's) in 15 sports. Nineteen of these teams participate in the Big Ten, while rifle is a member of the single-sport [[Great America Rifle Conference]] and beach volleyball and bowling compete as independents.

Early nicknames for the university's athletic teams included the ''Old Gold Knights'' and the ''Bugeaters''. ''Cornhuskers'' first appeared in a school newspaper headline ("We Have Met The Cornhuskers And They Are Ours"), after a 20–18 upset victory over Iowa in 1893. In this instance, Cornhuskers was used to refer to Iowa.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StxilVkWZ-MC&q=We+Have+Met+The+Cornhuskers+And+They+Are+Ours&pg=PA17 |title=Nebraska Cornhusker Football |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |author=Fricke, Mark |year=2005 |pages=17| isbn=9780738534374}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omaha.com/blogs/from-the-archives-the-cornhuskers/article_645209e3-4801-5840-930a-c6987a4a151e.html |title=From the archives: The Cornhuskers |publisher=omaha.com |date=November 19, 2011 |access-date=October 26, 2016 |author=McHugh, Jolene |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.is/20161026182446/http://www.omaha.com/blogs/from-the-archives-the-cornhuskers/article_645209e3-4801-5840-930a-c6987a4a151e.html |archive-date=October 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv19/CFHSNv19n1d.pdf |title=Nebraska Football In The 1890s |publisher=library.la84.org |access-date=October 26, 2016 |author=Fricke, Mark |pages=11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026181205/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv19/CFHSNv19n1d.pdf |archive-date=October 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The first time the name was applied to Nebraska was in 1899, when Nebraska State Journal writer [[Cy Sherman]], who would later help originate the [[AP Poll]], began referring to Nebraska's [[1899 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|football team]] as the Cornhuskers.

For nearly 100 years, the Cornhuskers participated in the [[Big Eight Conference]] (previously known as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Big Six, and the Big Seven), and later for 15 years in the [[Big 12 Conference]], which was formed when the Big Eight merged with four members of the defunct [[Southwest Conference]]. Nebraska joined the Big Ten in 2011.

The Cornhuskers have two official mascots, [[Herbie Husker]] and [[Lil' Red]].

===Fight songs===
The University of Nebraska's fight song is ''[[Hail Varsity]]''. ''Dear Old Nebraska U'' (''There is No Place Like Nebraska''), while not the school's official fight song, is often heard more frequently at sporting events and university functions than ''Hail Varsity''. The lyrics and music to ''Dear Old Nebraska U'' are attributed to Harry Pecha, a 1924 NU graduate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unl.edu/band/songs.shtml |title=UNL Band fight songs |access-date=December 2, 2007 |publisher=University of Nebraska–Lincoln |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102225842/http://www.unl.edu/band/songs.shtml |archive-date=November 2, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other schools and locales across the United States – including the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Florida]], and the [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] public school system – sing similar tunes, often with [[We are the Boys|similar lyrics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20051009/f-l-o-r-i-d-a-or-is-it-t-o-l-e-d-o |title=F-L-O-R-I-D-A, or is it T-O-L-E-D-O? – The Gainesville Sun |publisher=Gainesville.com |date=2005-10-09 |access-date=2012-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804065825/http://www.gainesville.com/news/20051009/f-l-o-r-i-d-a-or-is-it-t-o-l-e-d-o |archive-date=August 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Student life==
About 78 percent of NU's students are from Nebraska, but the remaining 22 percent is made up of students from all forty-nine other states and 114 foreign countries. On-campus students are members of the UNL [[Residence Hall Association]], which serves as the governing body for residence halls. Select honorary seniors include the Nebraska-only [[Society of Innocents]] and the Black Masque chapter of [[Mortar Board]].

===Residence halls===
[[File:EstherKauffmanSouth.jpg|thumb|250px|The Esther L. Kauffman Academic Residential Center.]]
Approximately 40 percent of the student body lives on-campus in 15 traditional [[residence hall]]s, two on-campus apartment-style halls, and three on-campus suite-style halls.

There are nine traditional residence halls on City Campus:
* Abel
* Harper
* Husker Hall
* Kauffman Center
* Neihardt
* Sandoz
* Schramm
* Selleck
* Smith

City Campus also features two on-campus apartment-style halls (The Courtyards and The Village) and three on-campus suite-style halls (Eastside Suites, Knoll Residential Center, and University Suites). Cather and Pound were traditional residence halls on City Campus demolished in 2017. There is one residential hall and one residential center on East Campus: Massengale Residential Center, which contains both traditional and apartment-style housing, and Love Memorial Co-op.

===Student organizations===
NU's governing body for students is the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska (ASUN). Every year students vote for a president, two vice presidents, and a senate composed of representatives from each college. The president acts as the student regent to the NU Board of Regents.

NU has over 400 student organizations on campus that represent a variety of interests.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNL {{!}} Student Involvement {{!}} Student Organizations {{!}} Resources and Tools|url=http://involved.unl.edu/organizations/|access-date=December 10, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205143311/http://involved.unl.edu/organizations/|archive-date=December 5, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Organizations are supported by Student Involvement.

===Greek organizations===
UNL has a significant [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek population]], with about 5,200 students in 30 fraternities (28 chapters and two colonies) and 16 sororities.

===Media===
''[[The Daily Nebraskan]]'', known to students as the "DN", is NU's student newspaper. It was established in 1901 and was published every weekday during the fall and spring semesters and weekly during the summer until 2017, when students voted to reduce the paper's funding. The DN now operates mainly online, publishing only a monthly print copy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/opinion/letter-from-the-editor-smell-ya-later-dn/article_2b7c8364-2afd-11e7-bb74-df11e93ab2ee.html|title=Letter from the editor: Smell ya later, DN|first=Lani Hanson|last=Editor-in-Chief|website=The Daily Nebraskan|access-date=July 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606180413/http://www.dailynebraskan.com/opinion/letter-from-the-editor-smell-ya-later-dn/article_2b7c8364-2afd-11e7-bb74-df11e93ab2ee.html|archive-date=June 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In February 2008, The Publications Board recognized ''[[The DailyER]]'' as an affiliated publication and approved the printing costs of the first three issues of the satirical paper.<ref>[http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2007/12/12/News/Dailyer.Nebraskan.Receives.Approval-3143119.shtml Dailyer Nebraskan receives approval – News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521213148/http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2007/12/12/News/Dailyer.Nebraskan.Receives.Approval-3143119.shtml |date=May 21, 2008 }}</ref>
