He has championed the argument that "Africa is poor because she is not free", that the primary cause of African poverty is less a result of the oppression and mismanagement by [[colonialism|colonial powers]], but rather a result of modern oppressive native autocrats and [[socialism|socialist]] [[central planning]] policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1246_the_forum/page45.shtml|title = BBC World Service &#124; the Forum}}</ref> He also goes beyond criticism of the ''status quo'' to advocate for specific ways to address the abuses of the past and present; specifically he calls for [[Democracy|democratic government]], debt reexamination, modernized infrastructure, [[Free-market economics|free market economics]], and [[free trade]] to promote development.

==Life==
Ayittey holds a B.Sc. in Economics from the [[University of Ghana]], [[Legon]], an M.A. from the [[University of Western Ontario]] in [[Canada]], and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Manitoba]].

In 2008, Ayittey was listed by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' as one of the "[[Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll|Top 100 Public Intellectuals]]" who "are shaping the tenor of our time".<ref>[https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4314#bios Top 100 Public Intellectuals], ''Foreign Policy''</ref>

==Political views==
Ayittey believes there are three keys to successfully rescuing Africa from oppressive despotism:
* First, he advocates forming coalitions consisting of small groups of "elders" who have no political ties and monitor the activities of the various opposition groups. Ayittey explains "They must be able to reach out to all the opposition groups."<ref>{{cite web |last1=mariam |first1=al |title=Ayittey's War on African Dictators |url=http://open.salon.com/blog/almariam/2011/06/12/george_ayitteys_war_on_african_dictatorships |work=Online article |publisher=huffingpost |access-date=2011-12-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903172333/http://open.salon.com/blog/almariam/2011/06/12/george_ayitteys_war_on_african_dictatorships |archive-date=2011-09-03 }}</ref> "The council should bring all of the opposition into an alliance ", which would prevent dictators from overpowering severely divided competition.
* Second, nations have to gain control of the civil service, security forces, judiciary, election centers, and national bank. Ayittey sees control of at least one of these resources as central to subverting dictatorial power in African countries. These organizations are currently staffed by cronies of dictators throughout Africa.
* Third, and finally, a nation has to use the correct sequence of reforms.

== Personal life ==
George Ayittey's younger sister is the politician, [[Sherry Ayitey]].
