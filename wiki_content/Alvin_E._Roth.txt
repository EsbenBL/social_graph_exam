'''Alvin Elliot Roth''' (born December 18, 1951) is an American academic. He is the Craig and Susan McCaw professor of economics at [[Stanford University]] and the [[George Gund (philanthropist)|Gund]] professor of economics and business administration emeritus at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="AlRothspage">[http://www.stanford.edu/~alroth/ Al Roth's Game Theory, Experimental Economics, and Market Design Page] (accessed 2013-27-04).</ref> He was President of the [[American Economics Association]] in 2017.<ref>[https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/leadership/officers/past-officers/presidents Past Presidents]</ref>

Roth has made significant contributions to the fields of [[game theory]], [[market design]] and [[experimental economics]], and is known for his emphasis on applying economic theory to solutions for "real-world" problems.<ref>Susan Adams, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0809/opinions-harvard-alvin-roth-freakonomics-ideas-opinions.html "Un-Freakonomics: A Harvard professor uses economics to save lives, assign doctors and get kids into the right high school."] ''[[Forbes]]'', August 9, 2010.</ref><ref>Leon Neyfakh, [https://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/04/03/the_matchmaker/?page=full "The Matchmaker: The Harvard economist who stopped just studying the world and began trying to fix it"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 3, 2011.</ref>

== Work ==
Roth has worked in the fields of game theory, market design, and experimental economics. In particular, he helped redesign mechanisms for selecting [[Residency (medicine)|medical residents]], [[New York City Department of Education|New York City high schools]] and [[Boston Public Schools|Boston primary schools]]. Describing the dynamism of market design, Roth suggests that 'As the conditions of the market change, the behavior of people change and that causes old rules to be discarded and new rules to be created'.<ref>Alvin Roth. https://www.ubs.com/microsites/nobel-perspectives/en/alvin-roth.html{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in UBS Nobel Perspectives interview, 2012.</ref>

=== Case study in game theory ===
{{main|Stable marriage problem|National Resident Matching Program}}
Roth's 1984 paper on the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) highlighted the system designed by John Stalknaker and F. J. Mullen in 1952.  The system was built on theoretical foundations independently introduced by [[David Gale]] and [[Lloyd Shapley]] in 1962.<ref>D. Gale and L. S. Shapley: "College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' 69, 9–14, 1962.</ref>  Roth proved that the NRMP was both [[Nash equilibrium#Stability|stable]] and [[Strategyproof|strategy-proof]] for unmarried residents but deferred to future study the question of how to match married couples efficiently.<ref>Alvin E. Roth (1984). [http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~aroth/papers/evolut.pdf "The Evolution of the Labor Market for Medical Interns and Residents: A Case Study in Game Theory"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720144049/http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~aroth/papers/evolut.pdf |date=July 20, 2008 }}. In: ''Journal of Political Economy'' 92: 991–1016. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>

In 1999 Roth redesigned the matching program to ensure stable matches even with married couples.<ref>Roth, Alvin E. ''Deferred Acceptance Algorithms: History, Theory, Practice, and Open Questions,'' International Journal of Game Theory, Special Issue in Honor of David Gale on his 85th birthday, 36, March 2008, 537–569.</ref><ref>Sara Robinson.

August 24, 2004.</ref>

=== New York City public school system ===
Roth later helped design the market to match New York City public school students to high schools as incoming freshmen.  Previously, the school district had students mail in a list of their five preferred schools in rank order, then mailed a photocopy of that list to each of the five schools.  As a result, schools could tell whether or not students had listed them as their first choice.  This meant that some students ''really'' had a choice of one school, rather than five.  It also meant that students had an incentive to hide their true preferences. Roth and his colleagues Atila Abdulkadiroğlu and [[Parag Pathak]] proposed [[David Gale]] and [[Lloyd Shapley|Lloyd Shapley's]] [[Incentive compatibility|incentive-compatible]] student-proposing [[Gale–Shapley algorithm|deferred acceptance algorithm]] to the school board in 2003. The school board accepted the measure as the method of selection for New York City public school students.

=== Boston's public school system ===
Working with Atila Abdulkadiroğlu, [[Parag Pathak|Parag A. Pathak]], and [[Tayfun Sonmez]], Roth presented a similar measure to Boston's public school system in 2003. Here the Boston system gave so much preference to an applicant's first choice that were a student to not receive her first or second choice, it was likely that she would not be matched with any school on her list and be administratively assigned to schools which had vacancies.
<ref>Gareth Cook (2003). [http://www2.bc.edu/~sonmezt/Bostonglobestoryonschoolchoice.htm "School assignment flaws detailed: Two economists study problem, offer relief"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210023706/http://www2.bc.edu/~sonmezt/Bostonglobestoryonschoolchoice.htm |date=2008-12-10 }} In: ''The Boston Globe'' 2003-9-12.</ref>

Boston: Boston University.</ref><ref>Roth noted that the West Zone Parents Group at Yahoo Groups, among others, devoted considerable time and effort to estimating capacity for schools in the area and disseminated recommendations on the basis of those estimates.</ref>  Boston held public hearings on the school selection system and finally in 2005 settled on David Gale and Lloyd Shapley's [[Incentive compatibility|incentive-compatible]] student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm.

The program was designed to operate primarily through the use of two pairs of incompatible donors.  Each donor was incompatible with her partner but could be compatible with another donor who was likewise incompatible with his partner.  [[Francis L. Delmonico|Francis Delmonico]], a transplant surgeon at [[Harvard Medical School]], describes a typical situation,<ref name=nsf>{{cite web

{{quote|Kidney exchange enables transplantation where it otherwise could not be accomplished.  It overcomes the frustration of a biological obstacle to transplantation. For instance, a wife may need a kidney and her husband may want to donate, but they have a blood type incompatibility that makes donation impossible. Now they can do an exchange. And we've done them. Now we are working on a three-way exchange.}}

Because the [[The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984|National Organ Transplant Act]] forbids the creation of binding contracts for organ transplant, steps in the procedure had to be performed roughly simultaneously.  Two pairs of patients means four operating rooms and four surgical teams acting in concert with each other. Hospitals and professionals in the transplant community felt that the practical burden of three pairwise exchanges would be too large.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roth |first=Alvin E. |author2=Tayfun Sonmez |author3=Utku Unver |title=Pairwise kidney exchange |journal=Journal of Economic Theory |volume=125 |issue=2 |page=153 |year=2005 |url=http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~aroth/papers/ajt.letter.2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jet.2005.04.004 |s2cid=583399 |access-date=July 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725095703/http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~aroth/papers/ajt.letter.2007.pdf |archive-date=July 25, 2010 }}</ref>  While the original theoretical work discovered that an "efficient frontier" would be reached with exchanges between three pairs of otherwise incompatible donors, it was determined that the goals of the program would not be sacrificed by limiting exchanges to pairs of incompatible donors.  A 12-party (six donors and six recipients) kidney exchange was performed in April 2008.<ref>{{cite news
