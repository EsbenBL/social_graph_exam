'''Federico Caffè''' (born 6 January 1914; disappeared 15 April 1987; [[declared death in absentia|declared dead]] 30 October 1998) was a notable [[Italy|Italian]] [[economist]] from the "Keynesian School".

== Early life ==
Caffè graduated in Business Sciences from the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] in 1936. After World War II, he spent one year in the [[United Kingdom]] studying at the [[London School of Economics]]. During that period, he came in contact with the [[Keynesian Economics]] and saw up close the policies implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|then Labour government]]. Back in Italy, he started his career working at the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]], later becoming a teacher at the [[University of Messina]]. From 1959 he taught Economic and Financial Policy at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], forming several generations of economists in what is the largest university in Italy.

==Career==
Caffè mentored several generations of Italian economists, many of whom rose to senior positions in academia, political life and public administration.

In different capacities he mentored the former Governor of the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]], and of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] President, and Italian incumbent Prime Minister Professor [[Mario Draghi]], the current Governor of the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]], [[Ignazio Visco]], the planning theorist [[Franco Archibugi]], the welfare economist [[Bruno Amoroso]], the [[labour economics|labour economist]] [[Ezio Tarantelli]], killed by the [[Red Brigades]] in 1985 in the courtyard of the Faculty of Economics in [[Rome]] where they taught, the former President of the Italian Statistical Office [[Guido M. Rey]], the former President of the Italian Statistical Office and incumbent Minister for Infrastructures [[Enrico Giovannini]], the Economic policy's theorist [[Nicola Acocella]], the neo-ricardian economist [[Fernando Vianello]] and economist of innovation [[Daniele Archibugi]].

==Views==
Caffè was particularly interested in [[economic policy]] and welfare, especially in their social dimensions. One of his books, ''Lezioni di politica economica'' (Lectures on Economic Policy), is widely regarded as the complete summary of his ideas. He was a strong critic of [[free trade]], avowedly [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] in inspiration, and also very interested in the [[Scandinavian welfare model]].<ref>See Nicola Acocella and Mario Tiberi, [http://www.worldeconomicsassociation.org/newsletterarticles/federico-caffe-the-man-the-teaching-and-the-intellectual-path/Federico Caffè: the man, the teaching, and the intellectual path], ''World Economic Forum Association Newsletter'', 4(1), February 2014.</ref>

==Disappearance==
On 15 April 1987 Caffè suddenly disappeared, shortly after having quit university teaching. He was "officially declared dead" on 30 October 1998. The mystery involved in his death has not been revealed. He may have committed suicide, but he may also have decided to disappear to an unknown location.<ref>Daniele Archibugi, [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2012/04/08/ragazzi-che-cercarono-il-professor-caffe.html I ragazzi che cercarono il professor Caffè], La Repubblica, 8 aprile 2012.</ref>

Several institutions have been named after him, including the Faculty of Economics of the [[Roma Tre University|University of Rome III]], the [[Roskilde University]] Centre for Southern European Studies and the Library of the Department of Economics of the Faculty of Economics and Business of the Sapienza University of Rome. The Aula Magna of Pescara University is called Federico Caffè also. The [[Sapienza University of Rome]] also organizes annual conference that have been held by some of the most significant economists of our age. Many of the lectures have been published in a series of the [[Cambridge University Press]].<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/it/academic/subjects/economics/macroeconomics-and-monetary-economics/series/federico-caffe-lectures Cambridge University Press Federico Caffè Lectures, edited by Nicola Acocella and Mario Tiberi]</ref>
