The '''Hinckley Institute of Politics''' is a nonpartisan institute located on the [[University of Utah]] campus in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Its purpose is "to engage students in transformative experiences and provide political thought leadership"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/mission/|title=Mission|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref> through involving students in practical [[politics]] and in governmental, civic and political processes.

Known for its internship program which has sent thousands of students to local, national, and global internship opportunities, the Hinckley Institute also provides educational programs for students, public school teachers and the general public. 

==History==
The Hinckley Institute was founded by [[Robert H. Hinckley]] in 1965 as a way to engage students in government and "encourage the youngest and best minds to enter into politics." Since that time, the Hinckley Institute has helped to provide more than 7,000 students with internships opportunities. Students have been placed with various organizations, such as public offices, elected officials, non-government organizations, for-profit corporations, political campaigns, and non-profits.

In addition to internships, the Hinckley Institute offers publicly available political forums, [[scholarships]], classes, excursions to [[Washington, D.C.]] and a campaign management minor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/campaign-management-minor/|title=Campaign Management Minor|publisher=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref>

==Internships==
The Hinckley Institute has provided University of Utah students with internship opportunities since 1966 and currently sends around 350 students every year to local, legislative, national, and global internships.

===Local===
The Hinckley Institute sends approximately 150 students each year to the most prestigious organizations in the Salt Lake City area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/local-internships|title=Local-Overview|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref> Students must register for at least three hours of course credit to participate. HNKLY classes are subject to standard tuition rates.  Students can calculate their tuition costs here. Internships are available all semesters and open to students of all majors. Hinckley interns who have worked in local internships have done things like: serve as campaign managers, scheduling coordinators, and volunteer supervisors for races in Utah and have worked in local offices for [[List of United States Senators from Utah|U.S. Senators]] and [[List of United States Representatives from Utah|Congressmen]], mayors, the Utah [[Lieutenant Governor of Utah|Lt. Governor]]’s office, the Attorney General’s office and the [[Chamber of Commerce]]. They have also worked in a number of non-profit organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] and the Utah Disability Law Center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/local/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623190644/http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/local/index.html |archive-date=2008-06-23 }}</ref>

=== Legislative ===
Hinckley Interns function as support staff to aid legislators during the spring semester of each year. An intern may be asked to track legislation, write speeches, attend committee meetings, research issues, and analyze bills. Hinckley interns at the Utah State Legislature must adapt to a rigorous work schedule, take initiative in planning and organizing, and develop an effective working relationship with legislators. The Utah State Legislature Internship program offers students unparalleled access to the Utah legislative process. Interns serve as full-time staff to legislators, lobbyists, and the media during the 45-day legislative session that begin in late January and work on a part-time basis in the weeks preceding the start of the session. Legislative interns are not able to take other classes during this session due to the full-time work schedule. Each legislative intern is paid $2,775 by the Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. State legislative interns represent the University of Utah and the Hinckley Institute of Politics, and therefore, the highest conduct is expected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/legislative-internships|title=Legislative Internships|publisher=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref>

===National===
The Hinckley Institute of Politics has sent interns to [[Washington, D.C.]] since 1973, providing more than 100 students annually with full-time, paid internships in a variety of government institutions, public advocacy groups, and media/consulting firms. Hinckley interns are provided internship scholarships to cover expenses (if internship is unpaid), subsidized housing in central DC apartments, and up to 12 hours of academic credit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/nationa-overview/|title=National-Overview|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref>

These interns work for members of the [[United States congressional delegations from Utah|Utah delegation]] on [[Capitol Hill]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], and major think tanks that affect American national policy. Offices that have hosted Hinckley interns include the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[Democratic National Committee]], the [[Republican National Committee]], the [[House Committee on International Relations]], and the [[White House]]. Students shadow legislators, congressmen and senators as well as learn the methods of [[lobbying]], media coverage, and communication within the U.S. national government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/washington/index.html |title=Internships: Washington, D.C. |access-date=2008-06-06 |publisher=Hinckley Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512160435/http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/washington/index.html |archive-date=2008-05-12 }}</ref>

==== Notable National Internship Opportunities ====

The students attended both the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican Conventions]]. From there they traveled to Washington, D.C. where they established their headquarters in the offices of Policy Impact,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.policyimpact.com/|title=Policy Impact Communications – Influence Where it Matters Most|website=www.policyimpact.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> a lobbying and public relations organization under the leadership of William Nixon (a Fellow of the Hinckley Institute of Politics).
