==History==
===Establishment (1895–1916)===
{{main|History of the University of Texas at Arlington (1895–1917)}}
[[File:The first building on the campus of Arlington College.jpg|thumb|left|An undated image of the first building on the campus of Arlington College]]

The university traces its roots back to the opening of '''Arlington College''' in September 1895. Arlington College was established as a private school for primary through secondary level students, equivalent to the modern 1st to 10th grades. At the time, the public school system in the city of Arlington was underfunded and understaffed.<ref name="DenmanJoyner">Clarence P. Denman Collection, Box 1, Files 1—15, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries; Arista Joyner Papers, GA 149, Folder 6, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries.</ref> Local merchant Edward Emmett Rankin organized fellow citizens of the city to donate materials and land to build a schoolhouse where the modern campus is now located.<ref name="Saxon">Saxon, G.D., “Transitions: A Centennial History of the University of Texas at Arlington,” The UTA Press, Arlington, Texas, 1995.</ref>

Rankin also convinced the two co-principals of the public school in Arlington, Lee Morgan Hammond and William Marshall Trimble, to invest in and hold the same positions at Arlington College. In the first few years, between 75 and 150 students were enrolled in the college. The public school began to rent space at Arlington College, and was eventually sold to the city in 1900. The public school building became so unsafe that all of the space in Arlington College was rented for the 1901–1902 school year until the creation of the Arlington Independent School District in 1902. Although the public education system was set to improve, Arlington College was closed and the property was sold to James McCoy Carlisle.

[[File:Carlisle Military Academy, 1911.jpg|thumb|Bird's-eye painting of Carlisle Military Academy, 1911]]
Carlisle was already established as a respected educator in the North Texas region, and he opened the '''Carlisle Military Academy''' in the fall of 1902. His program consisted of a balance between course work and military training. Enrollment increased to 150 students by 1905, and he began a large expansion of the campus. Baseball, football, basketball, and track teams were begun between 1904 and 1908. Around the same time, new barracks, a track, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool were built. The academy became known as one of the best at its level in the country.<ref name="Saxon"/> Unfortunately, enrollment did not continue to increase with the expansion in facilities and Carlisle ran into serious financial problems.

Lawsuits for the mortgages on the property were filed in 1911, and Carlisle Military Academy was closed in 1913. In the fall of 1913, [[Henry Kirby Taylor]] moved from Missouri, where he was president of the Northwest State Teachers' College, to set up another military academy called '''Arlington Training School'''.<ref name="AJ1">Arlington Journal, May May 16, 23, and August 1, 1913.</ref> He also was required to manage the finances and campus for the property owners. By the 1914–1915 school year, the campus contained 11 buildings on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land with 95 students enrolled.<ref name="ACatalog">Arlington Training School Catalog, 1914–1915.</ref> The school was incorporated in 1915 in order to raise funds to make improvements to the existing buildings, but more financial problems arose and another series of lawsuits were filed. Taylor left Arlington, and the property owners hired John B. Dodson to establish a third military academy for the 1916–1917 school year called '''Arlington Military Academy'''. Enrollment was apparently very low,<ref name="Saxon"/> and Arlington Military Academy closed after one year.[[File:1941 NTAC Science Building (Preston Hall).jpg|thumb|left|The Science Building at the North Texas Agricultural College in 1941. The building was constructed in 1928 and has since been renamed Preston Hall. It is one of the oldest surviving structures on the campus of the University of Texas at Arlington.]]

=== Texas A&M University System (1917–1965) ===

[[File:NTAC cadets on campus quad, 1920.jpg|thumb|NTAC Corps of Cadets on the campus quad, 1920s.]]
Since the turn of the 20th century, the prospects for turning the campus into a public, junior vocational college had been discussed. By 1917, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in College Station was overcrowded and had only one branch campus, Prairie View A&M. Vincent Woodbury Grubb, a lawyer and education advocate, organized Arlington officials to lobby the state legislature to create a new junior college.<ref name="Grubbs">"V.W. Grubbs," Vertical File, University Archives, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries</ref> The Arlington campus was established as a branch of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas and was called '''Grubbs Vocational College'''.<ref name="1917Legislature">Texas Legislature, Journal of the House of Representatives, 1917.</ref> Myron L.

Students were either enrolled in a high school or junior college program, and all men were required to be [[cadet]]s.<ref name="1917Grubbs">Bulletin of the Grubbs Vocational College, First Annual Catalogue, Announcements for 1917–18, September 1, 1917.</ref> Its name changed again in 1923 to the '''North Texas Agricultural College''' ('''NTAC'''). Edward Everett Davis replaced Williams as dean in 1925 and held that position for 21 years.<ref name="Saxon"/>

Davis worked continually to improve the quality of students, faculty, and facilities.<ref name="Davis">"N.T.A.C. Enrollment During Dean Davis' Administration, 1925–26 Through 1946–47," Office of the Presidents Records, Box 31, Folder 23.</ref> The [[Great Depression]] resulted in major cuts to funding and a decline in students, so more general college courses were gradually introduced at NTAC instead of vocational classes. During World War II, the college trained students with a "war program" focus<ref name="Davis2">E.E. Davis to T.U. Walton, April 7, 1943, Office of the Presidents Records, Box 25, Folder 13.</ref> and participated in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], offered at 131 colleges and universities in 1943, which gave students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name="utexasarlington-v-12">{{cite web |url=http://arc.uta.edu/misc/history.htm |title=History |publisher=[[Arlington, Texas]]: University of Texas at Arlington |access-date=September 29, 2011 |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811170802/http://arc.uta.edu/misc/history.htm |archive-date=August 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Dean Davis appointed [[Ernest H.

===University of Texas System (1965–present)===
[[File:University of Texas at Arlington campus and surrounding area (10000865).jpg|250px|thumb|Aerial view of the University of Texas at Arlington campus in 1967]]

The decision by the Texas A&M University governing board to block development at Arlington State College led officials of the college and a number of Arlington citizens to enlist the support of Governor [[John B. Connally|John Connally]] and key members of the Texas Legislature to separate Arlington State College from the Texas A&M University System and to join The [[University of Texas System]].<ref name="Saxon"/> As part of a plan that reorganized several university systems in Texas, Arlington State College officially became a part of The University of Texas System on September 1, 1965. To reflect its new membership within the UT System, the university adopted its current name in 1967.<ref name="insthist2">[https://www.uta.edu/studentaffairs/mavsmeet-history/uta-history UT Arlington History] Accessed May 15, 2011.</ref>

Joining the [[University of Texas System|UT System]] was of immediate consequence. In 1966 the Graduate School was established with an initial slate of six master's degrees and new construction projects started.<ref name="UT1">Arlington Citizen Journal, April 26, 1965.</ref> The 1969 approval of the first PhD program, in engineering, was a landmark event which set a precedent for other units on campus to follow.

Controversy erupted in the late 1960s over the use of a rebel theme that was started in 1951, including Confederate symbols and mock-slave auctions as campus traditions. After several years of efforts by President Frank Harrison to give students an opportunity to pick another theme, the UT System abolished rebels.<ref name="rebels">Rebel Theme Controversy Collection, Box 1, Folders 3–6.</ref> The Maverick theme was adopted after a student vote in 1971.

[[Wendell Nedderman]] served as acting president from 1972 to 1974 and president from 1974 to 1992. His tenure was characterized by increased growth and aspirations. In these years, the graduate student population increased from 936 to 4,200 and the overall university enrollment reached 25,135 students. Faculty research and publishing was emphasized along with the addition of doctoral programs in science, engineering, business, social work, and public and urban administration.<ref name="Saxon"/> The Texas Select Committee on Higher Education recognized UT Arlington as an emerging research institution in 1987.<ref name="researchinst">''The Shorthorn'', February 19, 1987.</ref>
The university experienced significant enrollment gains and rapid acceleration in research under the leadership of former presidents [[James D. Spaniolo]] and [[Vistasp Karbhari]]. The physical campus became much more residential in character and numerous major academic and student life buildings were added.

==Campuses==
===Main Campus surroundings===
The 420 acre main campus is at the southern edge of downtown [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], which also includes the largest branch of the public library, [[Seat of local government|City Hall]], [[Theatre Arlington]], Levitt Pavilion, [[Arlington Museum of Art]], churches, and numerous types of businesses just south of the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] line, around which the city was established.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=hja13|name=Arlington, Texas}}</ref>

The [[Barnett Shale]] formation sits below the campus and has earned the university millions of dollars from natural gas production since 2008. These funds are used for scholarships, faculty recruitment, and campus infrastructure upgrades.<ref>[https://www.uta.edu/ucomm/mediarelations/press/2009/01/Gas-check-received.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108094221/https://www.uta.edu/ucomm/mediarelations/press/2009/01/Gas-check-received.php |date=November 8, 2017 }} UT Arlington Receives First Natural Gas Royalty Check 2009-01-23, retrieved January 30, 2009</ref>

An unnamed branch of [[Johnson Creek (Texas)|Johnson Creek]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], runs along the southern portion of the campus. Cooper Street (which forms a part of [[Farm to Market Road 157]]) runs through the campus and provides access to [[Interstate 20 in Texas|Interstate 20]] and [[Interstate 30]]. [[AT&T Stadium]], [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]], [[Globe Life Field]], [[Six Flags Over Texas]], and the [[International Bowling Museum]] are two miles to the northeast.

===Main Campus architecture===
[[File:UTAWaterfall.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fountain on campus]]
The campus is organized on the city's former street grid. The topography generally slopes to the south and east to landscaped creeks. Decades of prodigious tree-planting and deliberate attention to landscape design have resulted in a shaded campus that is a pleasing pedestrian experience. Most streets in the campus core are closed and converted into pedestrian malls. The predominant east–west walk is the Second Street Mall, and the most important north–south passageway is Arlington Walk, extending from the Engineering Research Building on the north to the Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building on the south.

The oldest buildings on campus, Ransom Hall, Preston Hall, and College Hall are on the Second Street Mall and date to 1919.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 27.</ref> The architecture of these pre-World War II buildings is traditional. Later buildings from the 1960s, '70s, and '80s are typical of much campus construction of the period: modern, functional, and not especially noteworthy.<ref>Hamilton, Todd. "Reimagined Introvert". ''Texas Architect'', May/June 2008, page 60.</ref> An exception is the Architecture Building (designed by the respected Dallas firm, Pratt, Box, and Henderson)<ref>Pratt, James. "Pratt and Box:  Brief History of a Firm". ''Texas Architect'', July/Aug 2011, page 12.</ref> which forms an intimate and visit-worthy courtyard; the Nursing Building is noted for its unusual triangular shape. [[Texas Hall]] (George Dahl, architect) is a contributing building with its front portico, and [[Nedderman Hall]] is a contributing structure with its large atrium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.uta.edu/digitalgallery/items/show/23329|title=[Untitled] · UTA Libraries|website=library.uta.edu|access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref> An admirable feature of the campus is the aesthetic consistency of limestone and UTA-blend brick. Metal panels have appeared in construction since the late 1990s.<ref>Hightower, J. Brantley. "Quiet Standout". ''Texas Architect'', Jan/Feb 2008, page 47.</ref>

The Central Library, designed by prominent 20th-century architect [[George Dahl]] (well known contributions include [[Art Deco]] buildings at [[Fair Park|Dallas Fair Park]]), forms one side of a Library Quad which may be regarded as the heart of campus.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 63.</ref> The Central Library, Texas Hall, and Woolf Hall are of Mid-century Modern design. Attention to building design and the creation of outdoor spaces is evident with the [[postmodern]] additions of the Chemistry & Physics Building ([[Perkins + Will]]), Maverick Activities Center (Hughes Group with Page), Engineering Research Building ([[ZGF Architects]] with Page), [[College Park Center]] ([[HKS, Inc.]]), Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building (ZGF with Page), and Trinity Hall (Beck Group). The Chemistry & Physics Building contains one of the largest and most advanced [[planetarium]]s in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlington.org/listings/the-planetarium-at-ut-arlington/75/|title=The Planetarium at UT Arlington|website=www.arlington.org|access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref>
[[File:University of Texas at Arlington March 2021 031 (Vandergriff Hall at College Park).jpg|thumb|Vandergriff Hall at College Park]]

The north and east sides of campus have defined edges, being bounded by UTA Boulevard and Center Street, respectively. The south and west sides tend to blend more irregularly into the city. Cooper Street is a major artery that runs through campus and is partially depressed and spanned by three pedestrian bridges. Academic buildings erected over recent decades are on the east side of Cooper Street (defined by signage as "east campus").

Surface parking is pushed to the outer edges of campus, particularly south of the academic core, resulting in students getting more exercise than they may want during peak periods. The West Campus Parking Garage and the College Park parking garages on the northwest and northeast campus corners, respectively, provide some relief and advance the master plan goal of reducing surface parking. Green spaces, or outdoor rooms, have increased in the 2000s most notably with the creation of the Greene Research Quad, the Green at College Park, a sunken courtyard at Davis Hall, Brazos Park, and the Davis Street west campus edge. Located in various regions of campus are [[fiberglass]] horse statues with uniquely colored blue and orange patterns called "Spirit Horses."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uta.edu/universityevents/ambassadors/Spirit%20Horse%20Proposals.php |title=Spirit Horse – University Events – UT Arlington |publisher=Uta.edu |access-date=2016-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630005241/http://www.uta.edu/universityevents/ambassadors/Spirit%20Horse%20Proposals.php |archive-date=June 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The [https://www.uta.edu/collegeparkdistrict/index.php College Park District] is a $160&nbsp;million development completed in 2012 that significantly expanded the campus eastward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Despite-Business-Closures-Things-Looking-Up-for-College-Park-District-262060491.html|title=Better Business for Arlington's College Park District|access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref> The district has an arena with seating for 7,000 spectators, dormitory, student apartments, retail space, an 1,800-car parking garage, a welcome center, a credit union, and a 5-acre [[park]] called The Green at College Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uta.edu/collegepark/|title=College Park District – The University of Texas at Arlington|access-date=August 3, 2015}}</ref>

The on-campus resident population is over 5,000, creating a lively 24/7 environment.<ref>Hamilton, Todd. "Reimagined Introvert". ''Texas Architect'', May/June 2008, page 58.</ref> Large numbers of students live in Arlington Hall, [[Kalpana Chawla]] Hall, Vandergriff Hall, West Hall, and numerous on-campus apartments. ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' editorialized on June 23, 2012, that "UTA suddenly offers a new sense of place that surprises people who haven't taken a look for a few years."

The Commissioners Cup is awarded to the athletics program with the highest all-around performance in all conference events, including all men's and women's events.

The symbol is identical to [[University of Texas at El Paso|UTEP]]'s "Picks Up" symbol, but because of its resemblance of the letter "M" formed by the index, middle, and ring fingers, it is used by UTA to represent the first initial for the team name (the "Mavericks").]]

UT Arlington's basketball and volleyball teams play at [[College Park Center]], which opened with a women/men basketball double header on February 1, 2012. The new arena seats about 7,000 fans for sporting events and cost an estimated $78&nbsp;million. Athletic director [http://www.utamavs.com/genrel/jim_baker_793447.html Jim Baker] began work on the same date.

===Varsity sports===

UT Arlington fields teams or competitors in 15 [[NCAA Division I]] events, including [[UT Arlington Mavericks baseball|baseball]], basketball ([[UT Arlington Mavericks men's basketball|men's]] and [[UT Arlington Mavericks women's basketball|women's]]), tennis, golf, [[UT Arlington Mavericks softball|softball]], track, cross country and [[UT Arlington Mavericks women's volleyball|women's volleyball]].

Volleyball achieved the greatest team success in the history of the university by advancing to the [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|1989 NCAA Volleyball Final Four]]. The women's basketball team played in the 2005 and 2007 NCAA tournaments; the men's basketball team made its first appearance in the 2008 NCAA tournament, losing in the first round against No. 1 seed [[Memphis Tigers|Memphis]], who was later forced to vacate this and all other wins from the 2007–2008 season. The men's basketball team earned a berth the [[National Invitation Tournament]] for the third time during the 2016–2017 season, advancing to the quarter finals. The quarter-final run included a win at BYU and two home games at College Park Center in front of large crowds (need citation). In 2011–2012, the men's team advanced to the National Invitation Tournament, falling to the [[Washington Huskies]] on their home court in a highly competitive game in the opening round.<ref name="2011-12Season">{{cite web|publisher=[[UT Arlington Official Athletic Website]]|title=Record-setting season comes to a close|url=http://www.utamavs.com/sports/m-baskbl/recaps/031412aaa.html|date=March 13, 2012 |access-date=June 15, 2012}}</ref>

UT Arlington fielded a [[UT Arlington Mavericks football|football]] team, playing out of [[Maverick Stadium]], until it was discontinued after the 1985 season. The university administration noted major financial losses of about $1&nbsp;million per year and low average attendance (5,600, the student body at the time was 23,100). The program was funded by the university's auxiliary enterprise income while the other 14 sports were under-funded, as football accounted for half the total athletic budget.<ref name=UTA-football01>[https://www.uta.edu/sportsexpansion/ Executive Summary of the Neinas Report], UT Arlington Sports Expansion Study, 2004, Accessed May 13, 2008.</ref> Discussions take place periodically about restarting football but have not gained traction as an institutional priority.<ref name=UTA-football02>James D.

===UTA Cheer===
UTA's small coed [[cheerleading]] team has become a perennial power in Division I competitive cheerleading. The team has been crowned [[National Cheerleaders Association]] Collegiate National Champions in 2010, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uta.edu/spirit/ |title=Spirit Groups – UT Arlington |publisher=Uta.edu |access-date=2014-08-14}}</ref>

===Sports rivalries===
[[File:UTA SH CPC.jpg|thumb|The Spirit Horse at the College Park Center]]
The Texas State Bobcats, from a [[Central Texas]] peer institution, are a primary in-conference rival dating back to 1987 with concurrent memberships in three different conferences. As of the conclusion of the 2016–2017 seasons, UTA leads the all-time series in men's basketball (36–33), volleyball (42–35), softball (61–59), and football (2–0), and the Bobcats lead in women's basketball (31–39), and baseball (43–66).
 
UTA also maintains a relatively heated non-conference rivalry with the [[University of North Texas]] Mean Green. Periodic sporting events between the two are among the best attended for each team. It is the longest standing sport rivalry is men's basketball, which began in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/2014/08/unt-to-renew-rivalry-with-uta.html/|title=UNT to renew rivalry with UTA|work=Brett Vito's Mean Green Blog|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611023633/http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/2014/08/unt-to-renew-rivalry-with-uta.html/|archive-date=June 11, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
 
One of UTA's most anticipated baseball rivalries is with the [[TCU Horned Frogs]]. The two [[Tarrant County]] teams play annually in games that generate high attendance from both universities. 4,015 people saw the UTA/TCU match-up at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]] in 2013. Five of the top nine most attended games at [[Clay Gould Ballpark]] feature TCU as the visiting team.
 
With UTA beginning Sun Belt membership in 2013, conference rivalries were resumed with the Arkansas State Red Wolves, Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns, and Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks, who were all members of the [[Southland Conference]] at various points during UTA's tenure.
