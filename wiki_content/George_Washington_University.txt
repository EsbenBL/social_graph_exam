===Founding===
The first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], long favored the establishment of a university in the [[Washington, D.C.|capital of the United States]]. He wrote to the [[U.S. Congress]] and others in favor of it, and included a bequest in his last will and testament, though the shares lost their value and no educational institution ever benefited from them.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encyclopedia.gwu.edu/index.php?title=The_Fate_of_Washington%E2%80%99s_Bequest_to_a_National_University |title=The Fate of Washington's Bequest to a National University |author=Lyle Slovick |date=December 21, 2006 |encyclopedia=GW and Foggy Bottom Encyclopedia |access-date=July 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150309133327/http://encyclopedia.gwu.edu/index.php?title=The_Fate_of_Washington%E2%80%99s_Bequest_to_a_National_University |archive-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/06-04-02-0404-0001 |title=George Washington's Last Will and Testament |publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration |access-date=July 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20161001105725/http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/06-04-02-0404-0001 |archive-date=October 1, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Baptist]] missionary and leading [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] [[Luther Rice]] raised funds to purchase a site in [[Washington, D.C.]] for a college to educate citizens from throughout the young nation. A large building was constructed on College Hill, which is now known as [[Meridian Hill Park|Meridian Hill]], and on February 9, 1821, President [[James Monroe]] approved the [[congressional charter]] creating the non-denominational '''Columbian College.'''<ref name=washcity>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2011/02/09/today-in-d-c-history-charter-signed-for-gwus-predecessor-school/ |title=Today in D.C.

The first commencement in 1824 was considered an important event for the young city of Washington, D.C. In attendance were President Monroe, [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Henry Clay]], [[Marquis de Lafayette]] and other dignitaries.

GWU, like much of Washington, D.C., traces many of its origins back to the [[Freemasons]]. The [[Bible]] that the [[President of the George Washington University]] uses to swear an oath on upon inauguration is the Bible of Freemason George Washington. Freemasonry symbols are prominently displayed throughout the campus including the foundation stones of many of the university buildings.<ref name="freemasons">{{cite web|url=http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2005/10/17/News/Building.The.University.Freemasonry.Sjt.And.Gw-1022600.shtml|title=Building the University: Freemasonry, SJT, and GW|work=GW Hatchet|access-date=November 1, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324133942/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2005/10/17/News/Building.The.University.Freemasonry.Sjt.And.Gw-1022600.shtml|archive-date=March 24, 2008}}</ref>

===19th century===
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many students left to join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and the college's buildings were used as a [[Union Army]] [[military hospital]] and [[barracks]]. [[Walt Whitman]] was among many of the volunteers to work on the campus.

Following the war, in 1873, Columbian College became the '''Columbian University''' and moved to an urban downtown location centered on [[15th Street (Washington, D.C.)|15th]] and [[H Street (Washington, D.C.)|H streets]].<ref name=gwuhistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/history |title=History |publisher=George Washington University |access-date=July 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150804032946/http://www.gwu.edu/history |archive-date=August 4, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The majority of the present infrastructure and financial stability at GWU is due to the tenures of [[President of the George Washington University|GWU Presidents]] [[Cloyd Heck Marvin]], [[Lloyd Hartman Elliott]] and [[Stephen Joel Trachtenberg]]. In the 1930s, the university was a major center for [[theoretical physics]]. The cosmologist [[George Gamow]] produced critical work on the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] at GWU in the 1930s and 1940s. In one of the most important moments in the 20th century, [[Niels Bohr]] announced that [[Otto Hahn]] had successfully split the atom on January 26, 1939, at the Fifth Washington Conference on theoretical physics in the Hall of Government.<ref name="atomicage">{{cite book |title=Physics and Nuclear Arms Today |author=David W.

During the [[Vietnam War]] era, Thurston Hall, an undergraduate dormitory housing 1,116 students<ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.gwu.edu/thurston-hall|title=Thurston Hall|access-date=February 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222004836/http://living.gwu.edu/thurston-hall|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> was a staging ground for student anti-war Demonstrations. (At 1900 F Street NW, the building is 3 blocks from the [[White House]].)

In 1996, the university purchased the [[Mount Vernon College for Women]] in the city's [[The Palisades, Washington, D.C.|Palisades]] neighborhood that became the school's coeducational Mount Vernon Campus. The campus was first utilized in 1997 for women only but became co-educational in a matter of years. The [[Mount Vernon]] campus is now totally integrated into the GWU community, serving as a complement to the Foggy Bottom campus.

In 1999, GWU hosted the [[Town Hall with President Clinton]], the first [[Town hall meeting|presidential town hall]] to ever be [[webcast]] live.

===21st century===
In December 2006, the university named [[Johns Hopkins University]] provost [[Steven Knapp]] as the next [[President of the George Washington University]].

In July 2020, the university began forming special committees to look at possible name changes to an on-campus building and the school moniker. In a statement on the university's website, George Washington University President [[Thomas LeBlanc]] said one of the panels will examine the Colonials’ nickname, which critics say is antiquated and conjures up racism, violence and genocide. George Washington University law professor and Ward 3 D.C. Council member [[Mary Cheh]] will serve as chair of that committee.

====School of Nursing====
The history of nursing education at GWU spans more than 100 years. In 2002, Jean Johnson, Ph.D., RN, FAAN, then senior associate dean for Health Sciences, met with the nursing faculty to assess GW's capacity to create GW's degree programs. The faculty moved forward to develop an MSN in the GWU School of Medicine and Health Sciences with programs in adult [[nurse practitioner]], family nurse practitioner, nursing leadership and management, and clinical research administration. The first MSN class was admitted in 2004.<ref name="nursing.gwu.edu">{{cite web|url=http://nursing.gwu.edu/history|title=History - SON - School of Nursing|work=gwu.edu|access-date=January 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217163708/http://nursing.gwu.edu/history|archive-date=December 17, 2014}}</ref>
 
Meanwhile, approval was also obtained to develop a Department of Nursing Education. As the first and only chair of the department, Ellen Dawson, Ph.D., RN, ANP, led the MSN program to accreditation in time for the graduation of the first class in 2006. Also, she spearheaded the development of both the doctor of nursing practice (DNP) program and the 15-month (four consecutive semesters) accelerated second-degree bachelor of nursing science (ABSN) program located in Ashburn, VA. The first classes for these degrees were admitted in 2007 and 2009, respectively.<ref name="nursing.gwu.edu"/>

Bush]].<ref name="presidentbush">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/13/AR2006031301671_2.html |title=Bush's Refrain on Iraq Joined by a Smaller and Smaller Chorus |work=GW Hatchet |access-date=October 26, 2007 |first=Dana |last=Milbank |date=March 14, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501204950/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/13/AR2006031301671_2.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> The International Affairs Society (IAS) runs the university's internationally top-ranked Model United Nations team, in addition to hosting yearly high school and middle school Model UN conferences on campus. This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.

There are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GWU Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GWU Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled "Acappellapalooza," and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named "The United States of A-Cappella." In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GWU Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GWU Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GWU Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Each year, the groups duke it out at the Battle of the A-Cappella groups, one of the biggest student events on GW's campus.

Another student group, the Emergency Medical Response Group (EMeRG) provides an all-volunteer 24/7 ambulance service for the campus and the Foggy Bottom/West End community at no cost. EMeRG has been active on campus since 1994 and has advanced from bike response into a two ambulance system that is sanctioned by the District of Columbia Department of Health and DC Fire and EMS (DCFEMS). EMeRG also plays an active role in special events in around the DC area including the Marine Corps Marathon, National Marathon, Cherry Blossom Race, Commencement, Inauguration and other events in downtown D.C. and on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|last=GWU|first=EMeRG|title=Emergency Medical Response Group|url=http://gwemerg.com/|publisher=GWU EMeRG|access-date=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501114330/http://gwemerg.com/|archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Athletics==
[[File:George Washington Colonials logo.svg|thumb|The university's athletics teams are collectively known as the ''[[George Washington Colonials|GW Colonials]]''.]]
{{Main|George Washington Colonials}}
George Washington University is a member of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] and most of its teams play at the [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level. All indoor sports play at the [[Charles E. Smith Athletic Center|Smith Center]] on the Foggy Bottom campus. The outdoor events are held at the Mount Vernon campus Athletic Complex. The university's colors are [[buff (colour)|buff]] and [[blue]] (buff being a color similar to tan, but sometimes represented as gold or yellow). The colors were taken from George Washington's uniform in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The teams have achieved great successes in recent years including a first-round victory in the Men's NCAA Division I Soccer Tournament in 2004. The men's and women's varsity crew team rows out of Thompson's Boat Center on the Potomac River and competes in the [[Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges]]. In the 2008–09 season, the men's crew team placed an all-time high national ranking of 12th in the country. The sailing team competes in the [[Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association]] while the gymnastics team competes in the [[East Atlantic Gymnastics League]]. In 2007 the GWU Men's Water Polo team placed third at Eastern Championships and was ranked 14th in the nation. Officials announced that seven teams, such as "men's rowing, sailing, men’s and women’s squash, men’s indoor track, men’s tennis and women’s water polo will be eliminated" after the 2020-2021 school year, due to financial concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. These programs have the opportunity to become club sports following their elimination.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maise |first1=Emily |title=GW to cut seven teams following 2020-21 season amid financial stress, pandemic |url=https://www.gwhatchet.com/2020/08/01/gw-to-cut-seven-teams-following-2020-21-season-amid-financial-stress-pandemic/ |website=GW Hatchet}}</ref>

[[Mike Jarvis]] coached GWU in the 1990s, and led the team to the NCAA Sweet 16 in [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993]], where they were beaten by the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] [[1992–93 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|University of Michigan]] team (which later vacated its wins due to NCAA [[University of Michigan basketball scandal|rule violations]]). Jarvis also coached former Colonials head coach [[Karl Hobbs]] in high school. Former [[NBA]] player [[Yinka Dare]] also played at George Washington for two years before being drafted in the first round by the [[New Jersey Nets]].

Under former head coach [[Karl Hobbs]], GW's basketball team returned to the national stage in 2004 after defeating No. 9 [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] and No. 12 [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]] in back to back games to win the 2004 [[BB&T Classic Basketball Tournament|BB&T Classic]]. That year, the men's basketball team went on to win the Atlantic 10 West Title and the Atlantic 10 Tournament Title, earning an automatic bid to the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005 NCAA Tournament]]. The team received a No. 12 seed, losing to No. 5 seed [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech]] in the first round.

The team began the [[2005–06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2005–06 season]] ranked 21st in the [[Associated Press poll|''Associated Press'' poll]], reaching as high as sixth in the polls, and after some tournament success they closed out the year ranked 19th in the nation. They had a record of 26–2 going into the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006 NCAA Tournament]]. The 2005–06 team achieved the school's highest ranking in the last 50 years, peaking at No. 6 in the nation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/preview?gid=200602080227 |title=Streaking Colonials seek 11th straight win, host Dayton - NCAA Basketball - Yahoo!

In the tournament, they came back from an 18-point second-half deficit to defeat #9 seed [[UNC-Wilmington]], but lost to [[2005–06 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke University]], the top overall seed, in the second round.

While only one Colonial from the 2005–06 team was drafted in the [[2006 NBA Draft]], [[J. R. Pinnock]], two other Colonials from that team have played in the NBA. [[Pops Mensah-Bonsu]] played for the [[Dallas Mavericks]], [[Houston Rockets]], [[San Antonio Spurs]] and [[Toronto Raptors]] and [[Mike Hall (basketball)|Mike Hall]] played for the [[Washington Wizards]].
