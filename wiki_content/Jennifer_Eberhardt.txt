==Early life ==
Eberhardt was born in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], the youngest of five children. She was raised in [[Lee–Miles|Lee–Harvard]], a predominantly African-American middle-class neighborhood. When she was twelve, her family relocated to [[Beachwood, Ohio]].<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|date=2007-01-01|title=Champions of Psychology: Jennifer Eberhardt|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/champions-of-psychology-jennifer-eberhardt|journal=APS Observer|language=en-US|volume=20|issue=1}}</ref> Eberhardt credits her interest in race and inequality on her family’s move from the predominantly African-American working class neighbourhood of Lee-Harvard to the white suburb of Beachwood. The two neighbourhoods differed in terms of resources and opportunities despite their close proximity.<ref name=":8" /> She noticed that she and her non African-American classmates experienced life differently, such as her father and brothers being pulled over more frequently than other residents.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2014/09/cleveland_native_jennifer_eber.html|title=Cleveland native Jennifer Eberhardt awarded "genius grant"|last=Albrecht|first=Brian|date=2014-09-20|website=cleveland|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> This further increased her interest in racial inequality and changed her approach to understanding the world.<ref name=":9" />

== Education ==
After graduating from [[Beachwood High School]], she received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A]] from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1987. She then attended [[Harvard University]] where she received her [[Master of Arts|A.M]] in 1990 and Ph.D 1993.<ref name=":6" /> She is married to [[Ralph Richard Banks]], a law professor at Stanford University. Eberhardt and Banks were elementary schoolmates who reconnected at Harvard. They currently reside in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] with their three sons.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2019/03/23/racial-bias-is-shockingly-rife-and-surprisingly-fixable/|title=Racial bias is shockingly rife — and surprisingly fixable|last=Linge|first=Mary Kay|date=2019-03-23|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=":10" />

==Career==
From July 1993 to July 1994, Eberhardt was a postdoctoral research associate in the Social and Personality Psychology Division at the [[University of Massachusetts]]. Here, she conducted research on [[stereotyping]] and [[inter-group relations]]. She was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University, from September 1994 to June 1995, where she researched the impact of [[stereotype threat]] on academic performance. From July 1995 to June 1998, Eberhardt worked as an assistant professor at [[Yale University]] in the Department of Psychology and the Department of African Studies and African-American Studies. In September 1998, she accepted a teaching position at Stanford University in the Department of Psychology as an assistant professor. In May 2005, she was appointed as an associate professor, and at some point she became a full professor.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":6" /> Eberhardt is also the co-director and faculty co-founder of Stanford’s SPARQ (Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions) program. This center at Stanford brings together many industry leaders, researchers and well known faces in society to inspire cultural changes using insights from the behavioral sciences. Through SPARQ, Eberhardt demonstrates the consequences of racial associations in [[Racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system|criminal justice]], [[Racial disparities in education|education]] and business.<ref name=":6" />

== Research ==

=== Implicit bias ===
Eberhardt and her colleagues developed research that introduced alternative approaches to considering race and ethnicity.<ref name="Markus">{{cite journal |last1=Markus |first1=Hazel Rose |title=Pride, prejudice, and ambivalence: toward a unified theory of race and ethnicity |journal=American Psychologist |date=2008 |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=651–670 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.63.8.651|pmid=19014214 }}</ref> In 2008, she published a study that sought to examine how the variations in beliefs regarding the root of racial differences can impact social interactions.<ref name="Markus" /> The study’s findings revealed that those who believed racial differences arise due to biological differences differed from those who looked at race as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].<ref name="Markus" /> Those who view racial differences as biologically influenced are, according to this study, less likely to express interest in interracial relationships.<ref name="Sanchez">{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Diana T |last2=Garcia |first2=Julie A |title=When Race Matters: Racially Stigmatized Others and Perceiving Race as a Biological Construction Affect Biracial People's Daily Well-Being |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |date=2009 |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=1154–1164 |doi=10.1177/0146167209337628|pmid=19644133 |s2cid=17258546 }}</ref> These people were also at a higher risk of promoting race-based stereotypes, were less likely to set aside inequalities and defended these inequalities as a product of innate racial differences.<ref name="Markus" /> When people perceive racial differences as biologically determined, they create strict barriers between themselves and racial [[Outgroups|out-groups]].<ref name="Sanchez" /> This impacts the well-being of members of historically disadvantaged racial groups.<ref name="Sanchez" />

Golby and Eberhardt’s research focused on why humans are more likely to recognize people in their [[Own race bias|own race]] over those in another race.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Canli|first1=Turhan|last2=Amin|first2=Zenab|year=2002|title=Neuroimaging of emotion and personality: Scientific evidence and ethical considerations|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=50|issue=3|pages=414–431|doi=10.1016/S0278-2626(02)00517-1|pmid=12480487|s2cid=15190541}}</ref> African-American and European-American subjects looked at images of unfamiliar African-American and European-American faces while getting [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] scans.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Hugh R|last2=Loffler|first2=Gunter|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Frances|year=2002|title=Synthetic faces, face cubes, and the geometry of face space|journal=Vision Research|volume=42|issue=27|pages=2909–2923|doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(02)00362-0|pmid=12450502|s2cid=14247251|doi-access=free}}</ref> There was 1.5 times more activation in the [[Lateralization of brain function|right hemispher]]<nowiki/>e of the brain, specifically the [[fusiform face area]]s (FFAs), when looking at same-race faces.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Another finding was that memory recognition was greater for recognizing same-race faces in European-Americans which showed higher activation in the left fusiform cortex and the right [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] and [[Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal]] regions.<ref name=":0" /> This demonstrates that own- and other-race faces stimulate differential activation in the FFAs, however it does not explain why activation for same-race faces takes place in right side of the brain and memory encoding takes place in the left side of the brain. This can be an area for future research.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Guifei|last2=Liu|first2=Jiangang|last3=Xiao|first3=Naiqi G|last4=Wu|first4=Si Jia|last5=Hong|first5=Li|last6=Kang|first6=Lee|year=2018|title=The fusiform face area plays a greater role in holistic processing for own-race faces than other-race faces|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=12|pages=1–16|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2018.00220|pmid=29910716|pmc=5992462}}</ref>

=== Criminal justice ===

Eberhardt’s research demonstrated how the automatic effect of implicit racial stereotypes impacts one’s [[visual processing]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Jessi L|last2=Johnson|first2=Camille S|year=2006|title=A stereotype boost or choking under pressure? positive gender stereotypes and men who are low in domain identification|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=28|issue=1|pages=51–63|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp2801_5|s2cid=145684776}}</ref> A series of studies focusing on [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] were conducted, specifically priming individuals with images related to crime.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Proactive Policing: Effects on Crime and Communities|last1=Weisburd|first1=David|last2=Majmundar|first2=Malay K|publisher=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|year=2018|isbn=978-0-309-46713-1|location=Washington, DC: The National Academies Press|pages=280}}</ref> The intention was to see whether individuals would focus on White or Black faces when cued for crime. The study showed that people and officers specifically focused more on Black faces. The next study focused solely on officers who were separated into two groups, those who were primed for crime and those who weren’t. They were presented with a picture of a Black or White suspect and were asked to complete a memory task where they had to identify the suspect in a [[Police lineup|lineup]] with other suspects of the same race. Some lineups had suspects with highly stereotypical features of each respective race, whereas others had less stereotypical facial features. Crime-primed officers who viewed a Black suspect misremembered the suspect with someone who had more stereotypical Black features; but crime primed officers who saw a White suspect were less likely to identify a less stereotypical White suspect and more likely to associate it with a more stereotypical Black face.<ref name=":2" /> Eberhardt’s research shows how racial associations can impact the public's perception of Black people and crime and how this can influence how White people would misremember or neglect evidence that isn’t accurate for a Black defendant.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Collerton|first1=Daniel|last2=Perry|first2=Elaine|last3=McKeith|first3=Ian|year=2005|title=Why people see things that are not there: A novel Perception and Attention Deficit model for recurrent complex visual hallucinations|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=28|issue=6|pages=737–757|doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000130|pmid=16372931|s2cid=31813489}}</ref> This also introduces future directions for research such as the cognitive accessibility of primed information.<ref name=":3" />

In a 2006 study, Eberhardt and her colleagues examined databases in Philadelphia which examined whether the likelihood of being sentenced to death is related to the defendant looking stereotypically Black (thick lips, dark skin, dark hair, broad noses) when the victim was either Black or White. Those who were stereotypically Black were sentenced to death 57.5 percent of the time compared to 24.4 percent of the lighter African-Americans, especially if the victims were White. This research provides evidence that physical traits alone can influence sentencing decisions to quite an extent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vaughns-Purdie, V. & Eibach, P.

In a related 2008 study, Eberhardt and her colleagues conducted an analysis on printed newspaper articles regarding Caucasian and African-American convicts in line for the [[Death-penalty|death penalty]].<ref name="Leyens">{{cite journal |last1=Leyens |first1=Jacques-Philippe |last2=Demoulin |first2=Stephanie |last3=Vaes |first3=Jeroen |last4=Guant |first4=Ruth |last5=Paladino |first5=Maria Paola |title=Infra‐humanization: The Wall of Group Differences |journal=Social Issues and Policy Review |date=2007 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=139–172 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-2409.2007.00006.x}}</ref> This study was rooted in the notion that African-American males are frequently wrongly accused, misjudged and wrongfully remembered as aggressors.<ref name="Trawalter">{{cite journal |last1=Trawalter |first1=Sophie |last2=Todd |first2=Andrew R |last3=Baird |first3=Abigail A |last4=Richeson |first4=Jennifer A |title=Attending to threat: Race-based patterns of selective attention |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2008 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1322–1327 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.03.006|pmid=19727428 |pmc=2633407 }}</ref> During the analysis of the newspaper articles, the researchers’ main focus was on detecting “ape imagery” (this included characterizing a person as a beast, hairy, wild).<ref name="Leyens" /> They found this imagery was significantly more common for African-Americans than Caucasians.<ref name="Leyens" /> In the case of African-Americans, the ape imagery also predicted who would be sentenced to the death penalty.<ref name="Leyens" /> The research done by Eberhardt demonstrated not only the mistreatment of African-American detainees, but also the lack of [[civil rights]] available to members of other lower-status groups who are often misjudged as aggressors.<ref name="Conrad">{{cite journal |last1=Conrad |first1=Courtenay R |last2=Croco |first2=Sarah E |last3=Gomez |first3=Brad T |last4=Moore |first4=Whill H |title=Threat perception and American support for torture |journal=Political Behavior |date=2018 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=989–1009 |doi=10.1007/s11109-017-9433-5|s2cid=149107960 }}</ref>

In 2012, Eberhardt and colleagues studied how racial stereotypes can affect a juror’s perception of the legal distinction between a [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile]] and adult criminal offender. Participants read non-homicide case studies depicting either a Black or White juvenile offender. They found White Americans were more likely to support severe sentences when they read case studies depicting a Black juvenile offender than when the offender’s race was changed to White.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black girls and adolescents : facing the challenges|others=Collins, Catherine Fisher.|isbn=9781440830532|location=Santa Barbara, California|oclc=881440013|year = 2015}}</ref> This was because white offenders’ behaviour was more likely to be attributed to youthful indiscretion while Black offenders were more likely to be perceived as having the maturity and criminal intentions of adults.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social issues in living color : challenges and solutions from the perspective of ethnic minority psychology|others=Blume, Arthur W.|isbn=9781440833366|location=Santa Barbara, California|oclc=953984780|year = 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The jury under fire : myth, controversy, and reform|last=Bornstein, Brian H.|others=Greene, Edie|isbn=9780190201340|location=New York, NY|oclc=957554794|year = 2017}}</ref>

In another study in 2014, Eberhardt and Hetey (a Stanford University colleague) examined how just the [[Mere-exposure effect|mere exposure]] of racial disparities can impact an individual's support for harsh criminal justice policies. White participants were split into two groups, in group one they watched a video clip in which 25 percent of the images were of Black inmates and in group two, 45 percent of the images were of Black inmates. They were then informed of strict criminal laws abiding in the state of California, followed by a petition form to sign to amend the laws and make them less harsh. From group one, more than 50 percent of the participants signed the petition, whereas only 28 percent of group two agreed to sign it.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Hughey, W.

In 2015, The [[Oakland Police Department]] committed to participate in President [[Barack Obama]]’s Police Data Initiative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/05/18/launching-police-data-initiative|title=Launching the Police Data Initiative|date=2015-05-18|website=whitehouse.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Through SPARQ, Eberhardt worked with the Oakland Police Department to analyze police stop data for racial disparities. They used [[computational linguistics]] to assess interactions between officers and members of the Oakland community. Although they found no explicit bias, they found that when speaking to white drivers, officers were reassuring, used positive words, and expressed concern for safety. In contrast, when officers were speaking to Black drivers, they more often used negative terms, stuttered,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Microaggression theory : influence and implications|others=Torino, Gina C.|isbn=9781119420064|location=Hoboken, NJ|oclc=1037884707|date = 2018-09-25}}</ref> used informal language, and used less explanatory terms.<ref name=":2" /> The researchers made fifty recommendations for critical changes within the Oakland Police Department, many of which have been implemented as of the report’s 2017 release. The recommendations create a model that spans four categories: data analysis, policies and practices, training, and community engagement. As of 2017, Eberhardt and her team have since given bias training to ninety percent of the Oakland Police Department’s officers.<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2016/oakland-engages-stanford-university-for-groundbreaking-independent-stop-data-report|title=Oakland Engages Stanford University for Groundbreaking, Independent…|website=City of Oakland|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>

=== Bias in the education system ===
Okonofua and Eberhardt (2015) examined teachers' responses to students' misbehaviors, and whether there were racial differences in how these responses were directed. The study discovered teachers' responses contributed to racial disparities in discipline in the sense that Black students are more likely to be labeled as "troublemakers" than White students.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Andrew J. Elliot, , Carol S. Dweck, David S. Yeager |title=Handbook of Competence and Motivation, Second Edition : Theory and Application}}</ref> It was also found that when students of color and White students commit similar behaviors, the behaviors are viewed as being more serious for students of color.<ref>{{cite document |last1=Subini Ancy Annamma |title=The Pedagogy of Pathologization : Dis/abled Girls of Color in the School-Prison Nexus |id={{ProQuest|1993190096}} }}</ref> Black students' misbehaviors are more likely to be viewed as a pattern than White students. The study also found that responses given by teachers may potentially drive racial differences in students' behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jason A. Okonofua and Jennifer L. Eberhardt |title=Two Strikes: Race and the Disciplining of Young Students |journal=Psychological Science |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=617–24 |date=2015 |doi=10.1177/0956797615570365|pmid=25854276 |s2cid=206587768 }}</ref>

In 2016, Okonofua, Walton, and Eberhardt ran a [[meta-analysis]] on past research literature examining how social-psychological factors play a role in the structure of racial disparities in teacher-student relationships. Findings in the research suggest pervasive negative stereotypes may give rise to mistrustful relationships between racially stigmatized students and teachers. For example, in instances where Black students are often given the label of ‘troublemakers’, students may feel [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] and have distrust for teachers, thus they are more likely to misbehave in the future.<ref name="Examining Racial Bias in Education">{{cite journal |last1=Natasha Warikoo, Stacey Sinclair, Jessica Fei, Drew Jacoby-Senghor |title=Examining Racial Bias in Education: A New Approach |doi=10.3102/0013189X16683408 | volume=45 |year=2016 |journal=Educational Researcher |pages=508–514 |s2cid=56096350 }}</ref> As a result, such teachers' interactions with students through frequent labelling can potentially produce a never-ending cycle of increased punishment and misbehaviors.<ref name="Examining Racial Bias in Education"/> Due to such issue, a discipline gap is produced, which results in Black students having less opportunity to learn.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Christi Bergin |title=Designing a Prosocial Classroom: Fostering Collaboration in Students from PreK-12 with the Curriculum You Already Use |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUZRDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|isbn=9780393711998 |date=2018-05-29 }}</ref> The meta-analysis also noted an approach that has been implemented in over 7000 schools in the U.S. called the [[Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports]] approach (PBIS), the authors argued although the approach aims to improve students’ behavior, the subject of positive teacher-student relationship is neglected. Therefore, future interventions should aim to solve psychological barriers in order to reinforce positive teacher-student relationships rather than placing the majority of emphasis on teaching social skills, or prescriptive rules.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~eberhard/downloads/2016-AViciousCycle.pdf|title=A Vicious Cycle: A Social–Psychological Account of Extreme Racial Disparities in School Discipline|last1=Okonofua, Jason A.; Walton, Gregory M.; Eberhardt, Jennifer L.|first1=(2016)|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science : A Journal of the Association for Psychological Science|year=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=381–98|publisher=Perspectives on Psychological Science|doi=10.1177/1745691616635592|pmid=27217251|s2cid=22651503}}</ref>
