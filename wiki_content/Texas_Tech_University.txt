== History ==
{{Main|History of Texas Tech University}}

=== Establishment ===
[[File:Texas Tech Adminstration Building 1923.jpg|left|thumb|[[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]] (''circa'' 1925)]]
The call to open a college in [[West Texas]] began shortly after settlers arrived in the area in the 1880s.<ref name="Landing Tech may have been biggest step in Lubbock's first 100&nbsp;years"/><ref name="Hub"/> In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] to be in [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]].<ref name="Abilene home to three distinguished colleges"/> However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered [[governor of Texas|Governor]] [[James E. Ferguson]] had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor [[Pat Morris Neff|Pat Neff]] vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas went so far as to recommend West Texas secede from the state.<ref name="Grad"/>

In 1923, the legislature decided, rather than a branch campus, a new university would better serve the region's needs under legislation co-authored by [[Texas State Senate|State Senator]] [[William H. Bledsoe]] of Lubbock and [[Texas House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Roy Alvin Baldwin]] of [[Slaton, Texas|Slaton]] in southern [[Lubbock County, Texas|Lubbock County]].<ref name="Handbook"/>  On February 10, 1923, Neff signed the legislation creating Texas Technological College, and in July of that year, a committee began searching for a site.<ref name=Grad /> When the committee's members visited Lubbock, they were overwhelmed to find residents lining the streets to show support for hosting the institution.<ref name="KCBD"/><ref name="Three universities power higher education in Lubbock"/> That August, Lubbock was chosen on the first ballot over other area towns, including [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]], [[Plainview, Texas|Plainview]], [[Big Spring, Texas|Big Spring]], and [[Sweetwater, Texas|Sweetwater]].<ref name=KCBD />

Construction of the college campus began on November 1, 1924.<ref name=Hub /> Ten days later, the cornerstone of the [[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]] was laid in front of 20,000 people. Governor Pat Neff, [[Amon G. Carter]], Reverend E. E. Robinson, Colonel [[Ernest O. Thompson]], and Representative [[Richard M. Chitwood]], the chairman of the House Education Committee, who became the first Texas Tech business manager, spoke at the event. Chitwood served in the position only fifteen months; he died in November 1926.<ref name="Texas Tech University Archives"/> With an enrollment of 914 students—both men and women—Texas Technological College opened for classes on October 1, 1925.<ref name="College of Arts and Sciences"/><ref name="Joining of communities led to Lubbock"/><ref name="Texas Tech... The Unobserved Heritage"/> It was originally composed of four schools—Agriculture, Engineering, Home Economics, and Liberal Arts.<ref name=Handbook />

Texas Tech grew slowly in the early years. During the 1930s, [[Bradford Knapp]], the university's second president, proceeded with an expansion program, which included new dormitories, the first library (now the mathematics building), a golf course, a swimming pool, paved streets and alleys, and landscaping. A proposed $80,000 allocation for a football stadium was shelved. The library won the approval of Governor [[James V. Allred]]. Because the state cut appropriations by 30% at the start of the [[Great Depression]], President Knapp applied for assistance from the major [[New Deal]] agencies to expand Texas Tech, including the [[Works Progress Administration]], [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), [[Civil Works Administration]], and the [[National Youth Administration]]. [[Wyatt C. Hedrick]], son-in-law of Governor [[Ross S. Sterling]], was the architect of all campus PWA projects.<ref name="barwinkel"/>

Military training was conducted at the college as early as 1925, but formal [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] training did not start until 1936. By 1939, the school's enrollment had grown to 3,890. Although enrollment declined during [[World War II]], Texas Tech trained 4,747 men in its [[armed forces]] training detachments.<ref name=Handbook /> Following the war, in 1946, the college saw its enrollment leap to 5,366 from a low of 1,696 in 1943.<ref name="Raw Enrollment Data"/>

=== Expansion and growth ===
[[File:TTUadmin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]]]]
By the 1960s, the school had expanded its offerings to more than just technical subjects.<ref name="Controversy"/> The Faculty Advisory Committee suggested changing the name to "Texas State University", feeling the phrase "Technological College" did not define the institution's scope.<ref name="Fighting"/> While most students supported this change, the Board of Directors and many alumni, wanting to preserve the [[Double T]], opposed it.<ref name="About Us: History"/> Other names—University of the Southwest, Texas Technological College and State University,<ref name="Triumph, tragedy in world's spotlight"/> and The Texas University of Art, Science and Technology—were considered,<ref name="Game"/> but the Board of Directors chose Texas Tech University, submitting it to the state legislature in 1964.

A failed move by [[John Connally|Governor John Connally]] to have the school placed into the [[Texas A&M University System]], as well as continued disagreement and heated debate over the school's new name, kept the name change from being approved.<ref name=Controversy /><ref name=Fighting /> In spite of objections by many students and faculty, the Board of Directors again submitted the change in 1969. It finally received the legislature's approval on June 6 and the name Texas Tech University went into effect that September.<ref name=Game /> All of the institution's schools, except Law, became colleges.<ref name=Handbook /><ref name="General Information"/>

Texas Tech was [[Racial integration|integrated]] in 1961 when three [[African-American]] students were admitted. After its initial rejection of the students' enrollment and the threat of a lawsuit, the university enacted a policy to admit "all qualified applicants regardless of color".<ref name="Advancing Democracy: African Americans and the Struggle for Access and Equity in Higher Education in Texas"/> The university offered its first athletic scholarship to a black student in 1967, when Danny Hardaway was recruited to play for the Red Raiders football team.<ref name="Hardaway relates Tech experience"/> In 1970, Hortense W. Dixon became the first African American student to earn a doctorate from the university.<ref name="Texas Tech University Archives: Graduation Milestones"/> In 1972 Charles Henry became the first full-time African American faculty member.<ref name="Black faculty member">{{cite news |title=Black faculty member appointment announced at Texas Tech University last Friday afternoon |newspaper=West Texas Times |date=April 20, 1972 |page=1}}</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s, the university invested [[United States dollar|US$]]150&nbsp;million in the campus to construct buildings for the library, foreign languages, social sciences, communications, philosophy, electrical and petroleum engineering, art, and architecture. Some other buildings were significantly expanded.<ref name="TTUS"/>

On May 29, 1969, the [[Sixty-first Texas Legislature|61st Texas Legislature]] created the Texas Tech University School of Medicine.<ref name="Texas Tech University Archives: Medical School"/> The Texas Legislature expanded the medical school charter in 1979, creating the [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]. TTUHSC, which is now part of the [[Texas Tech University System]], includes Schools of Allied Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. It has locations in four Texas cities in addition to the main campus in Lubbock.<ref name="Profile: Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center"/>

In 2011, the combined enrollment in the [[Texas Tech University System]] was greater than 42,000 students—a 48% increase since 2000. Chancellor Kent Hance reiterated plans for Texas Tech's main campus to reach enrollment of 40,000 students by 2020, with additional 5,000 students at [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]] and 10,000 students at [[Angelo State University]].<ref name="Balancing state's budget requires all do fair share"/>

=== Recent history ===
[[File:TTU English Philosophy Building.jpg|thumb|left|Texas Tech's English and Philosophy Building, with architecture influenced by English manors, faces a building of similar style for the College of Education.]]
In 1996, the [[Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System|Board of Regents of Texas Tech University]] created the Texas Tech University System. Former [[Texas State Senate|State Senator]] [[John T. Montford]], later of [[San Antonio]], was selected as the first [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] to lead the combined academic enterprise.<ref name="Perry suggests AT&T executive for UT chancellor job"/> Regents Chair [[Edward Whitacre Jr.]] stated the move was made due to the institution's size and complexity. "It's time", he said, "to take the university into the 21st century".<ref name=TTUS /> The Texas Tech University system originally included Texas Tech University and [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]. On November 6, 2007, the voters of Texas approved an amendment to the [[Texas Constitution]] realigning [[Angelo State University]] with the Texas Tech University System.<ref name="Texas Legislature Online"/> [[Kent Hance]], a Texas Tech graduate who had served as [[United States Representative]] and as one of the three elected members of the [[Railroad Commission of Texas|Texas Board which regulates the oil-and-gas industry]], assumed the duties of chancellor on December 1, 2006.<ref name="Kent Hance Officially Named Chancellor of the Texas Tech University System"/>

Although growth continued at Texas Tech, the university was not immune to controversy. In 2003, a third-year student at the [[Texas Tech University School of Law|Texas Tech School of Law]] filed suit against the university over its policy on [[free speech zone]]s, which restricted student speech to a single "free speech gazebo".<ref name="ADF"/> The following year, a [[federal judge]] declared the policy [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].<ref name=ADF /><ref name="Law student sues Texas Tech over free speech zones: Plaintiff claims First Amendment rights were violated by university"/><ref name="A look at the Free Speech Zone: Zone offers a default location to express sometimes unpopular ideas"/>

To meet the demands of its increased enrollment and expanding research, the university has invested more than $548&nbsp;million in new construction since 2000. It has also received more than $65.9&nbsp;million in private donations.<ref name=TTUS /> In April 2009, the [[Texas House of Representatives]] passed a bill to increase state funding for seven public universities. Texas Tech University is classified by the state as an "[[Texas Research Initiatives|Emerging Research University]]", and is among the universities that will receive additional state funding for advancement toward "Tier 1" status. Three funds—the Research University Development Fund, the [[Texas Research Initiatives|Texas Research Incentive Program]], and the National Research University Benchmark Fund—have been established and will provide $500&nbsp;million in grants and matching funds during fiscal years 2010 and 2011.<ref name="Texas House OKs bill to fund 'tier one' competition'"/> On September 2, 2009, the university announced it had received private gifts totaling $24.3&nbsp;million. Of these, $21.5&nbsp;million are eligible for match under the Texas Research Incentive Program.<ref name="Texas Tech Announces TRIP Funds"/>

In late 2011 and throughout 2012–13, construction began on several new buildings on campus.<ref name="newconstruction">{{cite web|last=Gonzales|first=Patrick|title=New Additions Mark Texas Tech's Growth, Progress|url=http://today.ttu.edu/2012/09/new-additions-mark-texas-techs-growth-progress/|publisher=Texas Tech University|access-date=April 11, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215130224/http://today.ttu.edu/2012/09/new-additions-mark-texas-techs-growth-progress/ | archive-date = December 15, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref> The construction included a new $20&nbsp;million Petroleum Engineering and Research building, a new building to house the Rawls College of Business, two new residence halls, a $3.5&nbsp;million chapel, and extensive remodeling of the building that previously housed the Rawls College of Business.<ref name=newconstruction />

The university system's endowment surpassed the $1 billion barrier for the first time in March 2014 at $1.043 billion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ursch|first=Blake|title=Texas Tech System endowment exceeds $1 billion|url=http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2014-03-30/texas-tech-system-endowment-exceeds-1-billion|access-date=March 31, 2014|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|date=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

=== Mascots ===
[[The Masked Rider]] is Texas Tech University's oldest mascot. The tradition began in 1936, when "ghost riders" were dared to circle the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the [[Gator Bowl]]. According to reports from those at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'' who witnessed the event, later wrote, "No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance."<ref name="Mascots unmasked: A lasting tradition for Texas Tech began at 1954 Gator Bowl"/><ref name="History of Masked Rider: A history of one of Texas Tech's Oldest and Best-Loved Traditions"/> In 2000, The Masked Rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue outside of the university's Frazier Alumni Pavilion. The sculpture, created by artist Grant Speed, is 25% larger than life.<ref name="Rider stands larger than life: A new statue dedicated to the history of the Masked Rider finds its home"/>

Today, the Masked Rider, with [[guns up]], leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive [[gaucho]] hat like those worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech.

Texas Tech's other mascot, [[Raider Red]], is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternative mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the [[Texas Tech University traditions#Spirit organizations|Saddle Tramps]] student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist [[Dirk West]], a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor.<ref name="Dirk West: Before the mustache, guns"/> Although the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.<ref name="Raider Red"/> The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders.

== Traditions ==
{{Main|Texas Tech University traditions}}

=== Carol of Lights ===
[[File:TTUlights.jpg|thumb|left|Carol of Lights]]
The Carol of Lights is an annual event, sponsored by the Residence Halls Association, traditionally held the first Friday in December, to celebrate the holiday season. The event begins with a carillon concert, from the 43 bells in the west tower of the [[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]] followed a torch-light processional by the [[Saddle Tramps]] and [[High Riders]] spirit organizations. The Texas Tech Trombone Choir and combined choirs lead the crowd in singing carols and the illumination ceremony culminates with a soloist performance of "O Holy Night" in the Science Quadrangle. This is followed by the lighting ceremony, where 13 buildings within the [[Texas Technological College Historic District]] are illuminated with the over 25,000 red, white, and orange lights.<ref name="Carol of Lights"/> The lights remain on the campus buildings until the first week when students come back from the holiday break.<ref name="ttu 1"/>

In 1959, Texas Tech University Board of Directors member Harold Hinn planned and provided the funding to cover the Science Quadrangle and Administration Building with 5,000 lights. However, students were away on Christmas break and did not see the display. The following year, the Residence Hall Association sponsored the event under the name "Christmas Sing". In 1961, the event was renamed Carol of Lights and the display increased to 16,000 lights.<ref name="Carol of Lights9"/> The tradition has since grown to include decorations like the 38-foot lighted Christmas tree, 3,000 luminaries lining the sidewalks of Memorial Circle, and a 21-foot fresh pine wreath hung on the Physics/Geosciences building built by Women's Service Organization.<ref name="ttu 1"/>

=== Double T ===
{{Main|Double T}}
[[File:Texas Tech Athletics logo.svg|upright|thumb|Double T]]
The most readily identified symbol of Texas Tech is the Double T. The logo, generally attributed to Texas Tech's first football coach, [[E. Y. Freeland]], was first used as decoration on the sweaters for the football players.<ref name="Double T Symbol"/> The Double T existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000. The new logo maintains the original premise, but incorporates three-dimensional beveling effects coupled with white trim.

To recognize the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. By tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is in the courtyard of the [[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]]. The logo is further embodied in the Double T [[neon sign]], donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT&T Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.<ref name="Parent"/>

=== Will Rogers and Soapsuds ===
{{Main|Riding Into the Sunset}}
[[File:Wrstatue.jpg|thumb|left|Will Rogers and Soapsuds]]
One of the most well-known landmarks on campus is the statue of [[Will Rogers]] on his horse Soapsuds. The statue, entitled "[[Riding Into the Sunset]]", has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950, by Rogers' longtime friend [[Amon G. Carter]].<ref name="Will and Soapsuds"/> Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue, and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of [[West Texas]].<ref name="Will Rogers statue dedicated"/>  The statue, estimated to cost $25,000 ($239,000 in 2013 dollars) when it was dedicated, stands {{convert|9|ft|11|in|m}} and weighs {{convert|3200|lb|kg}}.<ref name="How to Live as a Raider in 12 Big Ways"/> The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: "Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, 'Soapsuds', riding into the Western sunset."<ref name="Rogers"/>

The statue continues to be a part of school tradition. Before every home football game, the Saddle Tramps wrap it with red [[crêpe paper]], a tradition dating back to 1969 and a loss to [[Texas A&M]] after which the statue was found covered in maroon paint in an apparent prank. In times of national tragedies, the statue has also been wrapped in black crêpe paper.<ref name=Rogers/>

According to one [[wikt:campus legend|campus legend]] taught to students during freshman orientation, the statue was originally to be positioned with Will Rogers facing due west, so it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds' posterior end to face due east, a dubious greeting to visitors entering by the main eastern campus entrance where the statue is placed. The horse's rear would also be facing downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. The legend holds that this problem was solved by Tech's Civil Engineering department, who calculated that a 23° turn of Soapsuds' head to the north would line up Soapsuds' rear end directly toward [[College Station, Texas]], home of the rival [[Texas A&M Aggies]].<ref name=Rogers/><ref name="Ten things you didn't know about Texas Tech"/> Modern surveys and satellite imagery have determined the statue's posterior end actually points roughly equidistantly between College Station and Austin, home of another rival team, the [[Texas Longhorns]].<ref name="LubbockAvalanceJournal">{{Cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2011-10-04/texas-tech-will-rogers-and-legend-am#.Vgnhq_lVhBc|title = Texas Tech, Will Rogers and the legend of A&M}}</ref><ref name="SoapsudsMythraiders">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyGOF9Q4dVk]</ref>

=== Texas Tech ring ===
While the [[class ring]] had occasionally used a universal design, by the late 20th century, various styles were available. In 1999, the university reverted to a single ring design for the university's graduates. The new Official Texas Tech Alumni Association Class Ring symbolically captures the essence of Texas Tech with the prominent Double T logo surrounded by the school's full name and date of foundation. By tradition, undergraduates wear the ring with the Double T logo facing themselves. Upon graduation, the ring is turned so the logo faces outward.

One shoulder of the ring displays an image of the [[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]], with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an [[Bald eagle|American eagle]] perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.<ref name="TTAA Class Ring & Ceremony"/>
