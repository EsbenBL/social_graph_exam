Johnson's Vietnam Papers'' (1997), and ''Uncertain Warriors: Lyndon Johnson and His Vietnam Advisers'' (1993). ''The CIA and Congress: The Untold Story from Truman to Kennedy'' won the [[D.B. Hardeman Prize]] in 2005.  A former radio and television journalist, Barrett unsuccessfully sought election in Indiana to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1984.

==Education==
Barrett graduated from [[Wylie High School (Wylie, Texas)|Wylie (Texas) High School]] in 1969. He received his B.A. degree from the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1973, his M.A. from the University of Essex (England) in 1986, and his Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame in 1990.

==Research==
In 2005, Barrett discovered a volume of the [[CIA]]'s internal history titled "Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation, Volume III: Evolution of CIAâ€™s Anti-Castro Policies, 1951- January 1961". This volume had been declassified in 1998 under the  [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992|1992 Kennedy Assassination Records Act]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kornbluh |first1=Peter |title=CIA Sued for 'Holding History Hostage' on Bay of Pigs Invasion |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB341/index.htm |work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 341 |date=14 April 2011}}</ref> Among other revelations, Barrett leared via the volume that the head of the CIA had met prior to the [[Bay of Pigs]] project with a variety of corporate leaders whose companies had large investments in [[Cuba]]. Barrett says that he found the volume in a box labelled 'CIA Miscellaneous' while doing archival research at the [[National Archives]]. As of 2016, one of the five volumes of the history remained classified. By that year, as part of his research for a book on the interactions between the Kennedy White House and the CIA, Barrett had submitted three [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information]] Requests to the CIA requesting the volume. The CIA had not at that point released the volume.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fiorillo |first1=Victor |title=Villanova Professor Sues CIA Over ...
