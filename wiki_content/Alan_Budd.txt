'''Sir Alan Peter Budd''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|GBE}} (born 16 November 1937) is a prominent British economist, who was a founding member of the [[Bank of England]]'s [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) in 1997.

He left the MPC in May 1999, and between August 1999 and 2008 was [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[The Queen's College, Oxford]].

He was temporarily head of [[Her Majesty's Government]]'s [[Office for Budget Responsibility]] during 2010.<ref name="inman1">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/06/alan-budd-quits-government-spending-watchdog | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Alan Budd quits as government spending watchdog | first=Phillip | last=Inman | date=6 July 2010}}</ref>

==Education==
Budd went to [[Oundle School]], a [[Public school (UK)|public school]] in [[Northamptonshire]], and then studied at the [[London School of Economics]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] degree in [[economics]]. He subsequently went to the [[University of Oxford]] where he received an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] degree and to the [[University of Cambridge]] where he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2007-8/weekly/041007/acts.htm |title=Oxford University Gazette, 4 October 2007: University Acts |publisher=Ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083701/http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2007-8/weekly/041007/acts.htm |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

His academic posts have included the [[University of Southampton]], [[Carnegie-Mellon University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]] (Ford foundation visiting professor), and the [[University of New South Wales]] (Reserve Bank of Australia visiting professor).

==Economic positions==
After various academic roles, he became senior economic advisor to [[HM Treasury]] between 1970 and 1974. 
From 1979 to 1981 he was Special Adviser at the Treasury in [[Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] government. Reflecting on his position during this time, Budd expressed concerns that the policies that were implemented to allegedly reduce inflation might, in fact, have had a hidden agenda. In a documentary interview, Budd postulated that the Thatcher's actual goal might have been to deliberately raise unemployment in order to reduce the strength of the working classes and re-created a [[reserve army of labour]] to allow capitalists to make high profits. <ref>http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/03/thatcher-economic-budd-dispatches</ref>

During the 1980s he was a professor of economics and director of the Centre for Economic Forecasting at the [[London Business School]]. Other appointments have included group economic adviser, [[Barclays Bank]] (1989–91), and membership of the Advisory Board for Research Councils (1990–91).

Between 1991 and 1997, he was chief economic adviser to the Treasury, and headed the government economic service.

Among his activities as an economist, he is a governor of the ''[[National Institute for Economic and Social Research]]''; a founder member of the UK-Japan ''21st Century Group''; an executive editor of ''World Economics'' and a member of the editorial advisory board of the ''[[Oxford Review of Economic Policy]]''. He is also a senior adviser to [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] and a consultant to the [[G8]] Group. In 2005, he was appointed to the board of the [[IG Group]], a [[spread betting]] firm founded by [[Stuart Wheeler]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sir-alan-budd-to-join-tory-donors-spread-betting-firm-487543.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Rachel | last=Stevenson | title=Sir Alan Budd to join Tory donor's spread betting firm | date=14 April 2005}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==Public profile==
Budd was a member of the Independent Review Panel on the Future Funding of the [[BBC]] (1999), and chairman of the Gambling Review Body which produced the Gambling Review Report (2001). In 2004 he was asked to investigate the circumstances surrounding the issue of a visa to the nanny of [[Kimberly Quinn]], the lover of [[David Blunkett]], the then [[Home Secretary]]; Budd's report concluded that there was no evidence that Mr Blunkett had personally interfered in the visa application, but that he was "able to establish a chain of events linking Mr Blunkett to the change in the decision on [the] application." Blunkett resigned as home secretary after being told in advance of the report's findings.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Budd was elected [[Provost (education)|Provost]] (1999-2008) of [[The Queen's College]], Oxford University and is an Honorary Fellow of the College.

In May 2010 he came out of retirement to be the interim Chairman of the [[Office for Budget Responsibility]], set up by [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to assess the state of public finances and issue economic forecasts.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_02_10.htm |title=Speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, on the OBR and spending announcements |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524061451/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_02_10.htm |archivedate=24 May 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> He described this as "the most exciting challenge of my professional life". In July 2010 it was announced that he would not continue in the role after his initial 3-month contract expired.<ref>{{cite news|author=Economics |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7873605/Sir-Alan-Budd-to-leave-the-Office-for-Budget-Responsibility.html |title=Sir Alan Budd to leave the Office for Budget Responsibility |newspaper=Telegraph |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref><ref name="inman1"/> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported "His departure was expected and Budd had let it be known privately that he had never intended to serve as chairman of the OBR for anything other than a short period. His contract spanned the emergency Budget, leaving enough time thereafter to advise on the legislation needed to establish the OBR on a permanent basis."<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/65ccae4c-88c8-11df-8925-00144feab49a.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709000958/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/65ccae4c-88c8-11df-8925-00144feab49a.html |date=9 July 2010 }}</ref>
