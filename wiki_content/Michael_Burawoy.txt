'''Michael Burawoy''' (born 1947) is a British [[sociology|sociologist]] working within [[Marxism|Marxist]] social theory, best known as author of ''[[Manufacturing Consent (Burawoy book)|Manufacturing Consent: Changes in the Labor Process Under Monopoly Capitalism]]''—a study on work and organizations that has been translated into a number of languages, and the leading proponent of [[public sociology]]. Burawoy was also president of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 2004 and is a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 2006–2010, he was vice-president for the Committee of National Associations of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA). In the XVII ISA World Congress of Sociology he was elected the 17th President of the International Sociological Association (ISA) for the period 2010–2014.<ref name="presidents">{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/about/presidents/ |title=ISA Presidents |publisher=International Sociological Association|access-date=2012-07-25}}</ref>

==Biography==
Burawoy was born on 15 June 1947.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Graduating as a mathematics student from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1968, Burawoy went on to pursue postgraduate study in the newly independent African nation of [[Zambia]], while simultaneously working as a researcher for [[Anglo American PLC]]. Completing a [[master's degree]] at the [[University of Zambia]] in 1972, Burawoy enrolled as a doctoral student at the [[University of Chicago]], finishing a sociology dissertation with an ethnography of Chicago industrial workers, later to become ''[[Manufacturing Consent (Burawoy book)|Manufacturing Consent: Changes in the Labor Process Under Monopoly Capitalism]]''.

Aside from Burawoy's sociological study of the industrial workplace in Zambia, Burawoy has studied industrial workplaces in [[Chicago]], [[Hungary]], and post-Soviet [[Russia]]. His method of choice is usually [[participant observation]], more specifically [[ethnography]].<ref name="ethno" /> Based on his studies of the workplace he has looked into the nature of [[postcolonialism]], the organization of [[state socialism]], and the problems in the transition from [[socialism]].

In more recent times, Burawoy has moved away from observing factories to looking at his own place of work—the university—to consider the way sociology is taught to students and how it is put into the public domain. His work on [[public sociology]] is most prominently shown in his presidential address to the American Sociological Association in 2004, where he divides sociology into four separate (yet overlapping) categories: public sociology, [[policy sociology]] (which has an extra-academic audience), professional sociology (which addresses an academic audience familiar with theoretical and methodological frameworks common to the discipline of sociology), and lastly [[critical sociology]] which, like public sociology, produces reflexive knowledge but which is only available to an academic audience, like professional sociology.
