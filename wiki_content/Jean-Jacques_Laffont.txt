'''Jean-Jacques Marcel Laffont''' (April 13, 1947 – May 1, 2004) was a [[France|French]] [[economist]] specializing in [[public economics]] and [[information economics]]. Educated at the [[University of Toulouse]] and the Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique ([[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique|ENSAE]]) in Paris, he was awarded the [[Ph.D.]] in Economics by [[Harvard University]] in 1975.

Laffont taught at the [[École Polytechnique]] (1975–1987), and was Professor of Economics at [[Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales]] (1980–2004) and at the [[University of Toulouse]] I (1991–2001). In 1991, he founded Toulouse's [[Industrial Economics Institute]] (Institut D'Economie Industrielle, IDEI) which has become one of the most prominent European research centres in economics. From 2001 until his death, he was the inaugural holder of the [[University of Southern California]]'s John Elliott Chair in Economics. Over the course of his career, he wrote 17 books and more than 200 articles.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Jean-Jacques Laffont, Economist, Dies at 57|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/14/business/jean-jacques-laffont-economist-dies-at-57.html|access-date=4 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 May 2004}}</ref>  Had he lived, he might well have shared the 2014 [[Nobel Prize for Economics]] awarded to his colleague and collaborator [[Jean Tirole]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Treanor |first1=Jill |title=Jean Tirole wins Nobel prize for economics 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/13/jean-tirole-nobel-prize-economics |access-date=4 March 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=It's complicated.

== Contribution to economics ==
Laffont made pioneering contributions in [[microeconomics]], in particular, [[public economics]], [[development economics]], and the theory of [[imperfect information]], [[incentive]]s, and [[regulation]]. His 1993 book ''A Theory of Incentives in Procurement and Regulation'', written with [[Jean Tirole]], is a fundamental reference in the economics of the public sector and the theory of  regulation. In 2002, he published (with David Martimort) ''The Theory of Incentives: the Principal-Agent Model'', a treatise on the economics of information and incentives. His last book, ''Regulation and Development'', discussed policies for improving the economies of less developed countries.

==Death==
Jean-Jacques Laffont was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2002 and died of the disease at his home in Colomiers in the Haute Garonne region of southern France on May 1, 2004. He was survived by his wife, Colette; his daughters Cécile, Bénédicte and Charlotte; and his son, Bertrand.
