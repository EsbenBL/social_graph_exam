She is a research psychologist, best known for her studies into [[working memory]] deficits in children. She has worked extensively with Professor [[Alan Baddeley]], the co-creator, along with Professor [[Graham Hitch]], of arguably the most well-researched [[Working Memory Model|working memory model]]. In 2014 she was elected a [[British Academy#Fellowship|Fellow of the British Academy]], the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.<ref name="BA Fellow">{{cite web | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/british-academy-announces-42-new-fellows/2014585.article | title=British Academy announces 42 new fellows | publisher=Times Higher Education | date=18 July 2014 | accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref>

Gathercole's findings have demonstrated the link between working memory deficits in children and poor academic performance. Furthermore, she has contributed to recent research showing that working memory deficits can be overcome with computerised, adaptive [[working memory training]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bergman Nutley|first1=Sissela|last2=SÃ¶derqvist|first2=Stina|date=2017|title=How Is Working Memory Training Likely to Influence Academic Performance?
