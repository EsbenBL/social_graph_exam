'''Eduardo Kohn''' is Associate Professor of [[Anthropology]] at [[McGill University]] and winner of the 2014 Gregory Bateson Prize.<ref>Eduardo Kohn awarded 2014 Bateson Prize | http://www.culanth.org/fieldsights/625-eduardo-kohn-awarded-the-2014-bateson-prize {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131184403/http://www.culanth.org/fieldsights/625-eduardo-kohn-awarded-the-2014-bateson-prize |date=2016-01-31 }}</ref> He is best known for the book, ''How Forests Think''.

== Work ==
His 2013 book, ''How Forests Think'', has been described by [[Cambridge]] Professor of Anthropology [[Marilyn Strathern]] as "thought-leaping in the most creative sense," and "[a] supreme artifact of the human skill in symbolic thinking.".<ref>Reviews at University of California Press http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520276109</ref> The work draws upon four years [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] fieldwork with the Runa in the Upper Amazon in order to challenge the most basic assumptions of anthropological thought. Using the [[Semiotics|semiotic theory]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Kohn proposes that all life forms, not only humans, engage in processes of signification and therefore should be considered as able to think and learn. Arguing that [[Self|selfhood]] does not solely belong to humans, Kohn proposes that any entity which communicates through the use of signs can be considered a self, leading to a complex 'ecology of selves' of which humans and nonhumans are both a part.<ref>Kohn, Eduardo (2013) ''How Forests Think: Towards and Anthropology Beyond the Human'', University of California Press</ref> Kohn's work builds upon a growing body of literature, from authors such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Donna Haraway]] and [[Eduardo Viveiros de Castro]], which seeks to take the social sciences beyond the limits of strictly human relations.

''How Forests Think'' has been criticized for using a very weak definition of "thinking": "Under such a definition, a wide range of things could be said to think. However, this is no revolutionary discovery; it is simply a semantic shift giving the illusion of novelty."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fortier|first=Martin|date=May 2018|title=Of Trees and Signs|url=https://booksandideas.net/Of-Trees-and-Signs.html|journal=Books & Ideas}}</ref> Moreover, it has been argued that Kohn's weak definition of thinking does not account for the phenomenon of anthropomorphism and animism discussed by [[Philippe Descola]] and others. 

In 2014 HAU included an entire section based on a book symposium discussing ''How Forests Think.''<ref>Hau vol. 4 No.2 (2014), http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/issue/view/hau4.2</ref> including contributions from [[Bruno Latour]] and <ref>''On selves, forms, and forces'' | http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau4.2.014/1129</ref> [[Philippe Descola]].<ref>''All too human (still): A comment on Eduardo Kohn's How forests think''</ref>
