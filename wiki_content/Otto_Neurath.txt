'''Otto Karl Wilhelm Neurath''' ({{IPA-de|ˈnɔʏʀaːt|lang}}; 10 December 1882 – 22 December 1945) was an [[Austria]]n-born [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political economy|political economist]]. He was also the inventor of the [[Isotype (picture language)|ISOTYPE]] method of pictorial statistics and an innovator in museum practice. Before he fled his native country in 1934, Neurath was one of the leading figures of the [[Vienna Circle]].

==Early life==
Neurath was born to a Jewish family in [[Vienna]], the son of [[Wilhelm Neurath]] (1840–1901), a well-known political economist at the time. [[Helene Migerka]] was his cousin.<ref name=Memories>{{cite book|last1=Neurath|first1=edited by Marie|last2=Cohen|first2=Robert S.|title=Empiricism and sociology : the life and work of Otto Neurath.|url=https://archive.org/details/empiricismsociol0000neur|url-access=registration|date=1973|publisher=Reidel|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-9027702593|pages=[https://archive.org/details/empiricismsociol0000neur/page/2 2]}}</ref> He studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Vienna]] (he formally enrolled for classes only for two semesters in 1902–3). In 1906, he gained his [[Ph.D.]] in the department of [[Political Science]] and [[Statistics]] at the [[University of Berlin]] with a thesis entitled ''Zur Anschauung der Antike über Handel, Gewerbe und Landwirtschaft'' (''On the Conceptions in Antiquity of Trade, Commerce and Agriculture'').

He married Anna Schapire in 1907, who died in 1911 while bearing their son, Paul, and then married a close friend, the mathematician and philosopher [[Olga Hahn-Neurath|Olga Hahn]]. Perhaps because of his second wife's blindness and then because of the outbreak of war, Paul was sent to a children's home outside Vienna, where Neurath's mother lived, and returned to live with both of his parents when he was nine years old.

==Career in Vienna==
Neurath taught political economy at the [[Vienna Business School|New Vienna Commercial Academy]] in Vienna) until war broke out. Subsequently, he directed the Department of War Economy in the War Ministry. In 1917, he completed his [[habilitation]] thesis ''Die Kriegswirtschaftslehre und ihre Bedeutung für die Zukunft'' (''War Economics and Their Importance for the Future'') at [[Heidelberg University]]. In 1918, he became director of the Deutsches Kriegswirtschaftsmuseum (German Museum of War Economy, later the "Deutsches Wirtschaftsmuseum") at Leipzig. Here he worked with [[Wolfgang Schumann (1887-1964)|Wolfgang Schumann]], known from the [[Dürerbund]] for which Neurath had written many articles. During the [[German Revolution|political crisis]] which led to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]], Schumann urged him to work out a plan for socialization in Saxony.<ref>"Otto Neurath: Empiricism and Sociology". edited by [[Marie Neurath]] and [[Robert S. Cohen]]. Dordrecht-Holland/Boston-USA: [[D. Reidel Publishing Company]], 1973</ref> Along with Schumann and [[Hermann Kranold]] developed the ''Programm Kranold-Neurath-Schumann''. Neurath then joined the [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] in 1918–19 and ran an office for central economic planning in [[Munich]]. When the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was defeated, Neurath was imprisoned but returned to Austria after intervention from the Austrian government. While in prison, he wrote ''Anti-Spengler'', a critical attack on [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West|Decline of the West]]''.

In [[Red Vienna]], he joined the Social Democrats and became secretary of the [[Austrian Association for Settlements and Small Gardens]] (Verband für Siedlungs-und Kleingartenwesen), a collection of self-help groups that set out to provide housing and garden plots to its members. In 1923, he founded a new museum for housing and city planning called Siedlungsmuseum. In 1925 he renamed it [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] in Wien (Museum of Society and Economy in Vienna)<ref>The actual museum's website: http://www.wirtschaftsmuseum.at/wminorg.htm</ref> and founded an association for it, in which the Vienna city administration, the trade unions, the Chamber of Workers and the Bank of Workers became members. Then-mayor [[Karl Seitz]] acted as first proponent of the association. [[Julius Tandler]], city councillor for welfare and health, served at the first board of the museum together with other prominent social democratic politicians. The museum was provided with exhibition rooms at buildings of the city administration, the most prominent being the People's Hall at the [[Rathaus, Vienna|Vienna City Hall]].

To make the museum understandable for visitors from all around the polyglot [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Neurath worked on [[graphic design]] and visual education, believing that "Words divide, pictures unite," a coinage of his own that he displayed on the wall of his office there.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edmonds |first1=David |title=The Murder of Professor Schlick: The Rise and Fall of the Vienna Circle |date=2020 |quote=''Worte trennen, Bilder verbinden.'' |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=9780691164908 |page=60 |edition=First}}</ref> In the late 1920s, graphic designer and communications theorist [[Rudolf Modley]] served as an assistant to Neurath, contributing to a new means of communication: a visual "language."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bresnahan|first=Keith|year=2011|title="An Unused Esperanto": Internationalism and Pictographic Design, 1930-70|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–24|doi=10.2752/175470810X12863771378671|s2cid=147279431}}</ref> With the illustrator [[Gerd Arntz]] and with [[Marie Neurath|Marie Reidemeister]] (who he would marry in 1941), Neurath developed novel ways of representing quantitative information via easily interpretable icons. The forerunner of contemporary [[Infographic]]s, he initially called this the Vienna Method of Pictorial Statistics. As his ambitions for the project expanded beyond social and economic data related to Vienna, he renamed the project "[[Isotype (picture language)|Isotype]]", an acronymic nickname for the project's full title: International System of Typographic Picture Education.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Berko |first1=Lex |title=Isotype, the Proto-Infographic You Probably Didn't Know Existed |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/exmgwz/isotype-the-proto-infographic-you-probably-didnt-know-existed |access-date=7 November 2020 |work=Vice |issue=12 September 2013 |publisher=Vice Media}}</ref> At international conventions of city planners, Neurath presented and promoted his communication tools. During the 1930s, he also began promoting Isotype as an International Picture Language, connecting it both with the adult education movement and with the Internationalist passion for new and artificial languages like [[Esperanto]], although he stressed in talks and correspondence that Isotype was not intended to be a stand-alone language and was limited in what it could communicate.

In the 1920s, Neurath also became an ardent [[logical positivism|logical positivist]], and was the main author of the [[Vienna Circle]] manifesto. He was the driving force behind the [[Unified Science|Unity of Science]] movement and the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edmonds |first1=David |title=The Murder of Professor Schlick: The Rise and Fall of the Vienna Circle |date=2020 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=9780691164908 |page=60 |edition=First}}</ref>

==Exile==
===Netherlands===
During the [[Austrian Civil War]] in 1934, Neurath had been working in Moscow. Anticipating problems, he had asked to get a coded message in case it would be dangerous for him to return to Austria. As Marie Reidemeister reported later, after receiving the telegram "[[Carnap]] is waiting for you," Neurath chose to travel to [[The Hague]], the [[Netherlands]], instead of Vienna, to be able to continue his international work. He was joined by Arntz after affairs in Vienna had been sorted out as best they could. His wife also fled to the Netherlands, where she died in 1937.

===British Isles===
After the [[Luftwaffe]] had [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombed Rotterdam]], he and Marie Reidemeister fled to Britain, crossing the [[English Channel|Channel]] with other refugees in an open boat. He and Reidemeister married in 1941 after a period of being interned on the [[Isle of Man]] (Neurath was in [[Onchan]] Camp). In Britain, he and his wife set up the [[Isotype Institute]] in [[Oxford]] and he was asked to advise on, and design Isotype charts for, the intended redevelopment of the slums of [[Bilston]], near [[Wolverhampton]].

Neurath died, suddenly and unexpectedly, in December 1945. After his death, [[Marie Neurath]] continued the work of the Isotype Institute, publishing Neurath's writings posthumously, completing projects he had started and writing many children's books using the Isotype system, until her death in the 1980s.

==Ideas==

===Philosophy of science and language===
Neurath's work on [[protocol statement]]s tried to reconcile an [[Empiricism|empiricist]] concern for the grounding of knowledge in experience with the essential publicity of science. Neurath suggested that reports of experience should be understood to have a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] and hence public and impersonal character, rather than as being first person subjective pronouncements.<ref name=SEP/> [[Bertrand Russell]] took issue with Neurath's account of protocol statements in his book ''An Inquiry Into Meaning and Truth'' (p.&nbsp;139ff), on the grounds that it severed the connection to experience that is essential to an empiricist account of truth, facts and knowledge.

One of Neurath's later and most important{{according to whom|date=December 2016}} works, ''Physicalism'', completely transformed the nature of the logical positivist discussion of the program of unifying the sciences. Neurath delineates and explains his points of agreement with the general principles of the positivist program and its conceptual bases:
* the construction of a universal system which would comprehend all of the knowledge furnished by the various sciences, and
* the absolute rejection of [[metaphysics]], in the sense of any propositions not translatable into verifiable scientific sentences.
He then rejects the positivist treatment of language in general and, in particular, some of [[Wittgenstein]]'s early fundamental ideas.

First, Neurath rejects isomorphism between language and reality as useless metaphysical speculation, which would call for explaining how words and sentences could represent things in the external world. Instead, Neurath proposed that language and reality coincide—that reality consists in simply the totality of previously verified sentences in the language, and "truth" of a sentence is about its relationship to the totality of already verified sentences. If a sentence fails to "concord" (or cohere) with the totality of already verified sentences, then either it should be considered false, or some of that totality's propositions must be modified somehow. He thus views truth as internal [[coherence theory of truth|coherence]] of linguistic assertions, rather than anything to do with facts or other entities in the world. Moreover, the criterion of verification is to be applied to the system as a whole (see [[semantic holism]]) and not to single sentences. Such ideas profoundly shaped the ''holistic [[verificationism]]'' of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' (p.&nbsp;3f) made famous Neurath's analogy which compares the holistic nature of language and consequently scientific verification with the construction of a boat which is already at sea (cf. [[Ship of Theseus]]):

{{Quote|We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.}}

[[Keith Stanovich]] discusses this metaphor in context of [[memes]] and [[memeplexes]] and refers to this metaphor as a "[[Neurathian bootstrap]]".<ref>Stanovich, Keith E. (2004-05-15). The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin (1 ed.). University Of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-77089-3}}.</ref>

Neurath also rejected the notion that science should be reconstructed in terms of sense data, because perceptual experiences are too subjective to constitute a valid foundation for the formal reconstruction of science. Thus, the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] language that most positivists were still emphasizing was to be replaced by the language of mathematical physics. This would allow for the required objective formulations because it is based on spatio-temporal coordinates. Such a ''physicalistic'' approach to the sciences would facilitate the elimination of every residual element of metaphysics because it would permit them to be reduced to a system of assertions relative to physical facts.

"Finally, Neurath suggested that since language itself is a physical system, because it is made up of an ordered succession of sounds or symbols, it is capable of describing its own structure without contradiction."{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

These ideas helped form the foundation of the sort of [[physicalism]] which remains the dominant position{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}} in metaphysics and especially the [[philosophy of mind]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Economics===
In economics, Neurath was notable for his advocacy of ideas like "[[Calculation in kind|in-kind]]" economic accounting in place of monetary accounting. In the 1920s, he also advocated ''Vollsozialisierung'', that is "complete" rather than merely partial "[[Socialization (economics)|socialization]]".<ref>John O'Neill, "Socialist Calculation and Environmental Valuation: Money, Markets and Ecology," Science & Society, LXVI/1 (Spring 2002); Joan Martinez-Alier and Klaus Schlupmann, Ecological Economics: Energy, Environment, and Society (1987), 212-218.</ref> Thus, he advocated changes to the economic system that were more radical than those of the mainstream Social-Democratic parties of Germany and Austria. In the 1920s, Neurath debated these matters with leading Social Democratic theoreticians (such as [[Karl Kautsky]], who insisted that money is necessary in a socialist economy). While serving as a government economist during the war, Neurath had observed that "As a result of the war, in-kind calculus was applied more often and more systematically than before.... war was fought with ammunition and with the supply of food, not with money" i.e. that goods were [[Commensurability (economics)|incommensurable]]. This convinced Neurath of the feasibility of economic planning in terms of amounts of goods and services, without use of money.<ref>Günther Chaloupek, "Otto Neurath's Concepts of Socialization and Economic Calculation and his Socialist Critics"(2006), at www.chaloupek.eu/work/NeurathFin.pdf</ref><ref>Otto Neurath, ed. T. Uebel and R. S. Cohen, Economic Writings (2004), 304.</ref> In response to these ideas, [[Ludwig von Mises]] wrote his famous essay of 1920, "[[Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/econcalc.asp |title=Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth by Ludwig von Mises |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |access-date=1 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/in-partial-praise-of-a-positivist|author=John O'Neill|title=In partial praise of a positivist: The work of Otto Neurath|journal=Radical Philosophy|date=Nov–Dec 1995|access-date=16 October 2018}}</ref>

Otto Neurath believed it was ‘war socialism’ that would come into effect after capitalism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Desai |first1=Meghnad |title=Marx's Revenge |date=2002 |publisher=Verso |pages=190–195}}</ref> For Neurath, war economies showed advantages in speed of decision and execution, optimal distribution of means relative to (military) goals, and no-nonsense evaluation and utilization of inventiveness. Two disadvantages which he perceived as resulting from centralized decision-making were a reduction in productivity and a loss of the benefits of simple economic exchanges; but he thought that the reduction in productivity could be mitigated by means of "scientific" techniques based on analysis of work-flows etc. as advocated by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. Neurath believed that socio-economic theory and scientific methods could be applied together in contemporary practice.

Neurath's view on socioeconomic development was similar to the [[materialist conception of history]] first elaborated in [[classical Marxism]], in which technology and the state of epistemology come into conflict with social organization. In particular, Neurath, influenced also by [[James George Frazer]], associated the rise of scientific thinking and empiricism / positivism with the rise of socialism, both of which were coming into conflict with older modes of epistemology such as theology (which was allied with [[idealist]] philosophy), the latter of which served reactionary purposes. However, Neurath followed Frazer in claiming that primitive magic closely resembled modern technology, implying an [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] interpretation of both.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 225–6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref> Neurath claimed that magic was [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and therefore [[disenchantment]] could never be complete in a scientific age.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 227 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref> Adherents of the scientific view of the world recognize no authority other than science and reject all forms of metaphysics.
