==Biography==
Hsiao was born in [[Beijing, China]], and as a teenager immigrated to the United States, where his father was an economic advisor for the [[Kuomintang]] delegation to the [[United Nations]]. He grew up in [[Forest Hills, Queens]], and attended New York public schools. After graduating from college, Hsiao began his career as an [[actuary]] for Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, which was a predecessor to [[Cigna]]. Following this corporate stint, Hsiao moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], and was employed as an actuary to the [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) in 1968. When the Chief Actuary of the SSA resigned, Hsiao was appointed the acting Chief Actuary in 1970.

During this time, the Social Security Administration was roiled by efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to reform the social security system and maintain its solvency. Hsiao headed up two blue-ribbon panels and testified several times before Congress regarding the actuarial viability of the system under the funding mechanisms in place.  Eventually, in 1977, the Congress passed and President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed into law one of the most comprehensive legislative efforts to bolster the [[Social security system]].

Following this government service, Hsiao commenced studies at the Harvard University Institute of Government, which later became the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. He then entered the Ph.D program in the Department of Economics at Harvard University. His doctoral thesis was advised by [[Martin Feldstein]], who later was chair of the [[Council of Economic Advisors]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]].  Hsiao was appointed to the faculty of the Harvard School of Public Health as an assistant professor in 1979. He became a full professor in 1986. He was appointed to the K.T. Li chaired professorship in 1992, named for the [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] policy-maker [[Kwoh-Ting Li]].

==Work==
Among his many contributions to the fields of health care economics, policy, and social insurance was a landmark study called the [[Resource-Based Relative Value Scale|Resource-Based Relative Value Study]] or [[RBRVS]] which examined the United States system of reimbursing physicians for medical services. RBRVS led to a series of articles published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], one of the first times the prestigious journal had devoted an entire issue to articles on one subject. RBRVS led to a revolutionary reordering of physician reimbursement payments under [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] Part B which was passed by Congress and signed into law in 1989. However, RBRVS was never fully implemented, partially due to the [[American Medical Association]]-sponsored [[Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee]].<ref name="Reflections">{{Cite journal | author=[[Steven A.

Later, Hsiao conducted studies of the social insurance and [[medical payment]] systems of a vast array of foreign countries and regions, including [[Singapore]], [[Cyprus]], [[Taiwan]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[Hong Kong]] ([[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|SAR]] of [[People's Republic of China]]).  He is considered one of the world's foremost experts on health care economics and financing and regularly advises U.S. government agencies, foreign governments and non-governmental organizations such as the [[World Bank]], [[UNICEF]], and the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>Saltus, Richard.

Hsiao's recent studies include a demonstration project of a micro-health insurance plan in rural [[provinces in China]]. The program was highlighted in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Hsiao was also brought on by the legislature of [[Vermont]] to outline [[Vermont health care reform|three reforms for health care in the state]],<ref>Vermont Public Radio: [http://www.vpr.net/episode/50325/dr-william-hsiao-on-health-care-system-reform/ Dr. William Hsiao on Health Care System Reform]</ref> presenting a plan that eventually became the Green Mountain Care program in June 2010.<ref>[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/jfo/healthcare/Hsiao%20Proposal%20-%20public.pdf The Vermont Option: Achieving Affordable Universal Health Care].</ref>
