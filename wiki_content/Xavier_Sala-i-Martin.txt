==Professional work==
Sala i Martin is one of the leading economists in the field of economic growth<ref name=":0" /> and is consistently ranked among the most-cited economists in the world for works produced in the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.in-cites.com/nobel/2002-nobel-eco-top100.html ''100 Most-Cited Researchers in Economics''], ISE Essential Science Indicators, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~xs23/1000%20top%20Citations.pdf ''Worldwide Rankings of Economists and Economics Departments''], Tom Coupe, 2002</ref> His works include the topics of [[economic growth]], development in Africa, monetary economics, social security, health and economics, convergence, and [[classical liberal]] thinking, with his book ''Liberal Economics for Non-Economists and Non-Liberals''.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-8497936316 |title=Economía liberal para no economistas y no liberales |last1=Martín |first1=Xavier Sala i |year=2005}} {{in lang|es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-8499300078 |title=Economia liberal per a no economistes i no liberals |last1=Martín |first1=Xavier Sala i |date=October 2009}} {{in lang|ca}}</ref> The "liberal" in the title should be understood in the classic liberal/[[libertarianism|libertarian]] sense.

He has constructed an estimate of the world distribution of income,<ref>[http://www.salaimartin.com/media/pdf/w15433.pdf Estimate of the world distribution of income]</ref> which he has then used to estimate poverty rates and measures of inequality. The conclusions of this study offered a new point of view for two reasons. Firstly, the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]] used to believe that although poverty rates were falling, the total number of poor people was increasing. He claimed that both were falling. Secondly, the United Nations and the World Bank believe that individual income inequalities were on the rise. He claimed that they were not.<ref>[http://www.heritage.org/index/chapters/htm/Index2007_Chap1.cfm ''Global Inequality Fades as the Global Economy Grows''], Heritage.org, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, 2002</ref>
