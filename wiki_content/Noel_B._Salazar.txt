'''Noel B. Salazar''' (born 1973) is a sociocultural anthropologist known for his transdisciplinary work on mobility and travel, the local-to-global nexus, discourses and imaginaries of 'Otherness', heritage, cultural brokering, cosmopolitanism and endurance.

==Life==
Noel B. Salazar was born in [[Dunkirk]], France, of a Spanish father and a Belgian mother. He grew up in the historical Flemish town of [[Bruges]], a celebrated cultural tourism destination. Salazar studied psychology, philosophy, and development studies at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]] (Belgium), neuropsychology at the [[University of Essex]] (UK), and anthropology and African studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (United States). He is research professor in anthropology at the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Leuven, where he founded [http://soc.kuleuven.be/immrc/cumore/ CuMoRe] (Cultural Mobilities Research).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00059545|title=KU Leuven Who's Who Noel B. Salazar|website=kuleuven.be|access-date=5 March 2018}}</ref> His ethnographic fieldwork so far has focused on [[Indonesia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Chile]] and Belgium. Salazar currently lives in [[Brussels]], the "capital of Europe", together with his spouse and two daughters.

==Theory==
Noel B. Salazar's main research interests include anthropologies of (im)mobility and travel, the local-to-global nexus, discourses and imaginaries of alterity, cultural brokering, cosmopolitanism and endurance. His anthropological work synthesizes ethnographic findings with conceptual frameworks developed within anthropology, sociology, geography, cultural studies, tourism studies, philosophy and psychology. Salazar has won numerous grants for his research projects (including from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[European Union|EU]] [[Seventh Framework Programme]], and [[NFWO|FWO]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0514129|title=NSF Award Search: Award#0514129 - Dissertation research: Global connections and local tour guiding in Indonesia|website=nsf.gov|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_LANG=EN&PJ_RCN=10323416&pid=0&q=3E950FFBB081982B0A7CFB0C6F4AA3FF&type=sim|title=European Commission : CORDIS : Search : Simple|website=cordis.europa.eu|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fwo.be/CMSDownload.aspx?ID=0f2c0056-50ba-48fa-b30c-f630a3facd1e&L=nl|title=Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen - Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen|website=Fwo.be|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref>

While at the University of Pennsylvania, Salazar experienced first-hand the benefits of transdisciplinary research. His involvement within the Department of Anthropology's Public Interest Anthropology project taught him the necessity of bridging the divide between academia and the wider public. Together with archaeologist [[Benjamin W. Porter]], now professor at the Near Eastern Studies Department, [[UC Berkeley]], he applied the [[public interest]] perspective to [[heritage tourism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/anthropology/|title=Department of Anthropology|website=Sas.upenn.edu|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/13527250500337397 | volume=11 | issue=5 | title=Heritage Tourism, Conflict, and the Public Interest: An Introduction | journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies | pages=361–370| year=2005 | last1=Porter | first1=Benjamin W. | last2=Salazar | first2=Noel B. | s2cid=145581442 | url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/198861 }}</ref> Understanding the changing meaning and value of (intangible) [[cultural heritage]] is still high on his research agenda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trrworld.org/article.php?aid=343&year=2007&vol=32&issue=3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094805/http://www.trrworld.org/article.php?aid=343&year=2007&vol=32&issue=3 |archive-date=2015-04-02 }}</ref>

One of Salazar's key concepts is the one of ''imaginaries'', which he describes as "culturally shared and socially transmitted representational assemblages that are used as meaning-making devices (mediating how people act, cognize, and value the world)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045302240.html|title=Representation in Postcolonial Analysis - Dictionary definition of Representation in Postcolonial Analysis - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=22044928 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920053700/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=22044928 |archive-date=2016-09-20 }}</ref> He is currently using this concept to research the role of dominant discourses and images of (im)mobility in cultures across the globe.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/1070289X.2011.672859 | volume=18 | issue=6 | title=The Power of Imagination in Transnational Mobilities | journal=Identities | pages=576–598| year=2011 | last1=Salazar | first1=Noel B. | s2cid=143420324 | url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/275464 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/SalazarMomentous|title=Momentous Mobilities - Berghahn Books|website=Berghahnbooks.com|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref> Salazar conceives mobility as a locally circulating socio-cultural construct that positively values the ability to move, the freedom of movement, and the tendency to change easily or quickly. Salazar tries to bridge the academic gap between tourism and migration studies by studying the analytical purchase of (im)mobility as an overarching concept.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/news/wp20-published-tanzanian-migration-imaginaries |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318143952/http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/news/wp20-published-tanzanian-migration-imaginaries |archive-date=2014-03-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.annals.2011.10.004 | volume=39 | issue=2 | title=Tourism Imaginaries: A Conceptual Approach | journal=Annals of Tourism Research | pages=863–882| year=2012 | last1=Salazar | first1=Noel B. }}</ref> More concretely, his cultural mobilities research helps us to understand the complex (dis)connections between tourism imaginaries and ideas of transcultural migration. This work happens in close collaboration with established anthropologists such as Nina Glick Schiller ([[University of Manchester]]), [[Nelson H. H. Graburn]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]) and Alan Smart ([[University of Calgary]]).<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/1369183X.2013.723253 | volume=39 | issue=2 | title=Regimes of Mobility Across the Globe | journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies | pages=183–200| year=2013 | last1=Glick Schiller | first1=Nina | last2=Salazar | first2=Noel B. | s2cid=145774018 | url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/368374/3/Regimes+of+Mobility+across+the+Globe.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=SalazarTourism|title=Tourism Imaginaries|website=Berghahnbooks.com|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/1070289X.2012.683674 | volume=18 | issue=6 | title=Anthropological Takes on (Im)Mobility | journal=Identities | pages=i–ix| year=2011 | last1=Salazar | first1=Noel B. | last2=Smart | first2=Alan | s2cid=144692026 }}</ref>
