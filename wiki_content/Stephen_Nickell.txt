According to the [[British Academy]] Keynes Lecture, delivered in September 2005, he argued "In what follows we shall, among other things, argue that there has not been a spending boom, the non-spending boom was not credit-fuelled and there has probably not been a house price bubble."

Over the next few years it might keep on edging upwards." In a February 2008 [[Bloomberg News]] interview, he said: 'The actual size of the downturn is minute, how big is it going to be? I don't know, but it won't be very big.'<ref>{{cite web|last1=Swint|first1=Brian|title=U.K. Housing Market Slump 'Won't Be Very Big,' Nickell Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aagEovJHD9KI&refer=realestate|website=Bloomberg|access-date=28 December 2014}}</ref> The Bank of England estimated that by Q1 2009, due to declining house prices, 7% of owner-occupied mortgagors were in negative equity, equivalent to around 700,000 households.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} His former doctoral students include [[Sonia Bhalotra]], [[Jan Hatzius]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and [[Gina Raimondo]].<ref name=gina>{{cite thesis|degree=DPhil|publisher=University of Oxford|url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph015550334|title=Determinants of single motherhood in the United States|first= Gina|last=Raimondo|date=2002|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.270468}}|website=bodleian.ox.ac.uk|oclc=52794176}}</ref>
