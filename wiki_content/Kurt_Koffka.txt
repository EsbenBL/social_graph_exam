Kurt Koffka, born March 18, 1886 in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]], was raised by Luis Levy and Emil Koffka.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D51jFkXYFf4C&q=luise+levy+koffka's+mom&pg=PA108|title=Gestalt Psychology in German Culture, 1890-1967: Holism and the Quest for Objectivity|last=Ash|first=Mitchell G.|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521646277|language=en}}</ref> His mother listed herself as [[Protestant]] despite having a [[Jews|Jewish]] heritage.<ref name=":1" /> His father was a lawyer and his younger brother, Friedrich Koffka, went on to become a judge.<ref name=":1" /> In spite of the prevalence of law in his family, Kurt Koffka decided to pursue science as he was motivated by his maternal uncle who was a [[biologist]].<ref name=":0" />

Koffka married [[Mira Klein (German translator)|Mira Klein]], a participant in his experimental research, in 1909, but they later divorced.<ref name=":1" /> In 1923, he married Elisabeth Ahlgrimm who completed her PhD at [[Giessen]], but they divorced in 1926.<ref name=":10">{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of American Biography: Supplement III 1941-1945.|last=Harrower|first=Molly}}</ref> He remarried Mira until their second divorce in 1928 when he remarried Elisabeth whom he remained married to until his death.<ref name=":10" />  Koffka was forced to alter his lifestyle after developing a heart condition called [[Coronary thrombosis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/psychology-and-psychiatry-biographies/kurt-koffka#2|title=Kurt Koffka {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref> However, his condition did not hamper his work ethic as his lecturing and scientific projects occupied his time until he died.<ref name=":0" /> Koffka died on November 22, 1941, in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] and left many of his projects unfinished.<ref name=":0" />

== Education ==
Kurt Koffka's academic career began at the school of [[Wilhelmsgymnasium (Munich)|Wilhelmsgymnasium]] where he attended from 1892 to 1903.<ref name=":0" /> In 1903, Kurt Koffka traveled to Scotland to study at the [[University of Edinburgh]] for a year.<ref name=":0" /> His time at the [[University of Edinburgh]] was crucial as he developed a greater understanding of the English language which was a valuable tool for spreading his message in the future.<ref name=":0" /> In 1904, he returned to Berlin where he attended the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] for three years.<ref name=":0" /> He chose to pursue psychology as he believed the subject matter of psychology was best suited towards his interests.<ref name=":0" />

While studying at the [[University of Berlin]], Koffka examined his personal colour vision in [[Willibald Nagel]]’s physiological laboratory.<ref name=":0" />  He was interested in visual perception due to his own red-green blindness, which led him to study [[color vision]] and [[Afterimage|after-images.]]<ref>Wesley, F.

Retrieved from https://search.credoreference.com/content/topic/koffka_kurt_1886_1941.</ref> This work culminated in Koffka's first publication in 1908 called Untersuchungen an einem protanomalen System.<ref name=":0" /> This paper analyzed different properties of colour including contrast as well as the effect of brightness and wavelengths on colour.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure ground phenomenon]] was also studied.<ref name=":0" /> Koffka completed his dissertation called Experimental-Untersuchungen zur Lehre von Rhythmus securing him his Doctor of Philosophy in 1908.<ref name=":0" /> He worked with [[Carl Stumpf]] during the pursuit of his doctorate.<ref name=":0" />

== Career ==
After receiving his doctorate in 1908, Koffka worked at the [[University of Würzburg]] as an assistant to [[Oswald Külpe]] who greatly influenced his work.<ref name=":0" />  After Kulpe left, Koffka continued to work as an assistant to Karl Marbe.<ref>Harrower-Erickson, M.R. (1942). Kurt Koffka, 1886-1941. ''The American Journal of Psychology, 55(2)''. 278-281.</ref> In 1910, Koffka became an assistant to [[Friedrich Schumann (psychologist)|Friedrich Schumann]] at the Psychological Institute in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt on Main]] to study the perception of motion, alongside [[Max Wertheimer]] and [[Wolfgang Köhler]].<ref name=":0" /> Koffka considered this period in his life significant to his scientific development.<ref name=":0" />

Koffka later became a professor at the [[University of Giessen]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Psychologists in word and image|last=Wade, Nicholas.|year = 1995|publisher=[publisher not identified]|isbn=9780262285674|oclc=956673657}}</ref> The [[University of Giessen]] assigned Koffka the [[Privatdozent|Privatdozent title]] in 1911 and the [[Ausserordentlicher Professor|ausserordentlicher]] while working with August Messer.<ref name=":1" />  Eighteen articles and six experimental works were completed over the twelve years that Koffka spent at Giessen.<ref name=":0" /> Koffka spent time at Professor Sommer's Psychiatric Clinic located in [[Giessen]] in the midst of [[World War I]].<ref name=":0" /> They focused on subjects diagnosed with brain [[Traumatic brain injury|trauma]], but focused on [[aphasia]] cases. He also studied the localization of sounds to be of aid to the army and navy.<ref name=":0" />

In 1924, Koffka moved to the United States of America and retained a research professor position at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], beginning in 1927.<ref name=":0" /> His priority during this time was work regarding visual perception.<ref name=":0" />

In 1932, [[Uzbekistan]] was undergoing significant socioeconomic and political changes.<ref name=":0" /> It was at this time that Koffka traveled to [[Uzbekistan]] to join others in researching the impact of these changes on affected individuals cognition.<ref name=":0" /> His work did not result in any publications.<ref name=":0" /> However, while in [[Uzbekistan]], an illness, diagnosed as [[relapsing fever]], rendered Koffka very ill but, in spite of his condition, he began to work on his book, "The Principles of Gestalt Psychology", which was published in 1935.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":13">{{Cite book|title=Kurt Koffka, an unwitting self-portrait|last=Harrower, Molly Rachel, 1906-1999.|date=1983|publisher=University Presses of Florida|isbn=0-8130-0760-7|oclc=899107594}}</ref> Once this book was completed, Koffka's previous self-limitations were eased as he allowed himself to delve into areas he previously felt were inappropriate for his specialty.<ref name=":0" /> This broadened scope was evidenced by his incorporation of psychology in other fields of interest including the arts and ethics.<ref name=":0" /> He spent the year 1939-1940 visiting [[Sir Hugh Cairns]] at the Nuffield Institute in [[Oxford]].<ref name=":13" />

== Contributions to psychology ==

=== Learning ===
[[File:Gestalt proximity.svg|thumb|The Gestalt principle of proxmity]]
[[File:Gestalt similarity.svg|thumb|The Gestalt principle of similarity]]
Koffka believed that most of early learning is what he referred to as, "sensorimotor learning," which is a type of learning which occurs after a consequence.<ref name=":14" /> For example, a child who touches a hot stove will learn not to touch it again.<ref name=":14" /> Koffka also believed that a lot of learning occurs by imitation, though he argued that it is not necessary to understand how imitation works, but rather to acknowledge that it is a natural occurrence.<ref name=":14" /> According to Koffka, the highest type of learning is ideational learning, which makes use of language.<ref name=":14" /> Koffka notes that a crucial time in children's development is when they understand that objects have names.<ref name=":14">{{Cite book|title=A history of psychology : ideas and context|last=King, D. Brett.|date=2009|publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon|isbn=978-0-205-51213-3|oclc=173299040}}</ref>

=== Gestalt psychology ===
Koffka gained his initial interest in [[Gestalt psychology]] after participating in Wertheimer's [[phi phenomenon]] study. In 1910, Kurt Koffka worked alongside [[Max Wertheimer]] and [[Wolfgang Köhler]] at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt.<ref name=":15" /> They focused their research on sensory information and memory, and later became the founding fathers of Gestalt psychology.<ref name=":15" /> Max Wertheimer is often credited with developing the idea of Gestalt psychology, but they were influenced by [[Christian von Ehrenfels|Christian von Ehrenfel's]] idea that a holistic melody is more than a simple combination of various sounds. This later becomes essential to theories of Gestalt psychology which convey that complete perception is more meaningful than its individual parts put together.<ref name=":5" />

The ''[[Gestalt principles|Gestalt Principles]]'' were developed to delve into how the human eye perceives visual elements. The principles help to provide ways to understand how complex visual elements can be broken down into simpler parts. The principles also try to demonstrate how the human eye perceives shapes as a single “object” instead of splitting the object into simplified components of the object being seen.<ref>Arnheim, R. (1986). The two faces of gestalt psychology. ''American Psychologist, 41''(7). 820-824. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.41.7.820</ref> Some of the most commonly used principles were proximity, similarity, and continuation. ''[[Gestalt psychology#Law of Proximity|Gestalt principle of proximity]]'' discussed that visual elements close to one another will be perceived as a whole.<ref name=":2">Verlaers, K., Wagemans, J., & Overvliet, K. (2015). The effect of perceptual grouping on haptic numerosity perception. ''Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 77''(1). 353-367. doi:10.3758/s13414-014-0770-8</ref> ''[[Gestalt psychology#Law of Similarity|Gestalt principle of similarity]]'' establishes that people tend to categorize objects that share the same traits into a group.<ref name=":2" /> ''[[Gestalt psychology#Law of Continuity|Gestalt principle of continuity]]'' reveals how people perceive lines or curves as a whole if they “touch” one another.<ref name=":2" />

Koffka needed to provide empirical evidence for the new theory. To accomplish this, Koffka formulated a three-stage proposition that revolutionized existing assumptions of psychology:<ref name=":15">Kohler, W. (1942). Kurt Koffka, 1886-1941. ''Psychological Review, 49(2)''. 97-101. doi:10.1037/h0054684</ref>

# Perceiving sensory experiences as a combination of individual parts does not align with the actual experience of perception. The school of Gestalt suggests that human sensory experience be viewed as a whole since wholes are more meaningful than the sum of its parts.<ref name=":15" />
# It is a mistake to correlate a stimulus with sensation because functionality of a stimulus must be paired with factual information. Stimuli should be correlated to factual content of the perceptive field.<ref name=":15" />
# The previous two premises hold that the relationship between the psyche and physical needs to be reconsidered.<ref name=":15" />

In 1922, Kurt Koffka published an article called "Perception: An Introduction to the Gestalt-Theorie" in the [[Psychological Bulletin]] to introduce Gestalt psychology to the American academics.<ref name=":15" /> The article focused on describing how Gestalt psychology studies various perceptual phenomena using different theories from existing ones. After its publication, it led to the criticisms of Gestalt psychology that it was overly focused on perception, and lacked contribution to overall themes of psychology.<ref name=":15" />

=== Aesthetic Gestalt (1940) ===

In 1940, Kurf Koffka traveled to Philadelphia and attended a conference at Bryn Mawr which brought together many different well-known figures from different fields of study to approach art from different perspectives.<ref name=":4">Spehar, B., van Tonder, G. J. (2017). Koffka’s aesthetic gestalt. ''Leonardo'', ''50''(1). 53-57 Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.muse.jhu.edu/article/647700</nowiki>.</ref> At the time, many subjects such as culture, ecology, evolution, emotion, psychology, knowledge, physiology had been treated as their own independent fields with no connection to one another. Kurt Koffka attempted to make a multidisciplinary theory of art known as Aesthetic of Gestalt.<ref name=":4" /> Koffka's presentation at the conference advanced the scientific theory of art, but it is a neglected theory that has mostly been forgotten after its publication.<ref name=":4" />

The main focus in Aesthetic theory is the appreciation of beauty in art pieces. There are 3 components in the relationship: the self (the spectator), the extraordinary art piece, and the connection between the two.<ref name=":4" /> Aesthetic of Gestalt illustrates that the self (the individual) sees that there is an important message when observing the art piece.<ref name=":4" /> Koffka Identifies three problems with the aesthetic experience. The first is contingency. While behaviourists believe that art naturally evokes an emotional response, Koffka argued that the previous associations must exist to understand that redness for example means passion.<ref name=":4" /> This previous association is a rational and intelligible interaction that draws on a look-up table, not blindly resorting to the look-up table.<ref name=":4" /> The second problem is with the empathy-based art theories about aesthetic and how the fact that people put their own emotions onto the art piece is paradoxical. In order for an art piece to be appreciated the self must first recognize the emotion they must attribute to the piece.<ref name=":4" /> The third problem is that empathy logic implies that emotions projected by the self onto the art piece are to be felt by others. However, just because the person perceives that red is passionate does not mean they are feeling the same passion themselves.<ref name=":4" />

==Honours==
In 2006, members of the Department of Psychology of [[Justus Liebig University Giessen]] founded the [[Kurt Koffka Medal|Kurt-Koffka medal]] to honour scientists who have made extraordinary advances to the fields of perception or developmental psychology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/2010/12/06/kurt-koffka-medal-awarded-to-prof-roberta-klatzky/|title=Kurt-Koffka-Medal awarded to Prof. Roberta Klatzky – CNBC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>

== Publications ==

=== "Perception: An Introduction to the Gestalt-theorie" (1922) ===
In 1922, Kurt Koffka published an article called "Perception: An Introduction to the Gestalt-Theorie" in the [[Psychological Bulletin]] to introduce Gestalt psychology to the American academics.<ref name=":15" /> The article focused on how Gestalt psychology describes three main points which are sensation, association and attention with a different scope than other existing theories.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Koffka/Perception/perception.htm|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Koffka (1922)|website=psychclassics.yorku.ca}}</ref> Sensation puts forward the idea of the "[[Bundle theory|bundle-hypothesis]]" which means that the world is made up of elements that come together to create stimuli in our world.<ref name=":12" /> The second listed concept of association is acknowledged by Koffka as the primary factor that decides what is coming and going in regards to our ideas.<ref name=":12" /> It is association that puts one idea forward over another idea in our train of thought and ties all those separate elemental ideas together.<ref name=":12" /> The final point of attention is described as a "scapegoat" by Koffka. If one's attention fails to notice a stimuli then the correlated response to that stimuli will not happen, even though the stimuli is present.<ref name=":12" /> After its publication, Koffka's article led to the criticisms that gestalt psychology it was overly focused on perception, and lacked contribution to overall themes of psychology.<ref name=":15" />

=== ''The Growth of the Mind: An Introduction to Child Psychology'' (1924)  ===
One of Koffka's most notable contributions to psychology was his book entitled, “The Growth of the Mind: An Introduction to Child Psychology".<ref name=":6" /> The English translation of this book was done by Robert M. Ogden.<ref name=":6" /> Koffka had two main goals in writing this book. His first goal was to utilize Gestalt principles to present an innovative view of childhood phenomenon.<ref name=":6" /> His second goal was to provide educators with an up to date resource in order to facilitate effective teaching.<ref name=":6" /> In this book, Koffka focused on mind development in children and outlined four ways in which development occurs.<ref name=":6" /> Firstly, he stated physical movements must become more advanced and precise as children grow older.<ref name=":6" /> As infants, we begin with rudimentary motor skills and with development we can engage in more complex physical activities.<ref name=":6" /> Secondly, he believed infants must develop their sensory integration skills and learn to become effective perceivers of their environment.<ref name=":6" /> Thirdly, Koffka stated that children must utilize their motor and sensory systems as they are dependent on each other to create a coherent whole which is utilized to facilitate appropriate behaviour.<ref name=":6" /> Lastly, Koffka thought children must learn to rely on their cognition when acting as opposed to their impulses.<ref name=":6" />

=== ''The Principles of Gestalt Psychology'' (1935)  ===
This book addressed applied psychology but mainly focused on the research concerning perception, memory, and learning. Koffka published this book in 1935 and it changed the basic ideas within research involving perception. Veridical perception states that objects people see in the environment will have relatively consistent characteristics such as size, and color.<ref name=":9" /> Before this book was published, researchers had assumed that there was no need to explain the features of veridical perception. Koffka rejected the idea that researchers should only focus on illusions within people's perception, because he thought it was always necessary to understand why people perceive objects the way that they do.<ref name=":9" /> This book approaches the topic of veridical perception in a phenomenological and holistic manner that supported the Gestalt Principles as well as other research that supported the Gestalt orientation.<ref name=":9" /> This work also explored the notion of behavioural environments. A person's behaviour can result from one's own behavioural environment or another person's behavioural environment.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=A History of Psychology|last=Benjafield|first=John G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|location=Oxford, United Kingdom}}</ref> This means that someone can see and understand their actions one way and another person could see the same actions and understand them completely differently. Psychologists need to be mindful to view an individual's behaviour from the other individual's behavioural environment rather than their own.<ref name=":7" />
