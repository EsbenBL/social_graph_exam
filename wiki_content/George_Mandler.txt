Mandler discussed the limit of 4 ± 1  to working memory, categorization, subitizing, and reasoning.  In the 1950s, together with S. B. Sarason, he initiated research on [[test anxiety]]. Among his books are ''Mind and Emotion'', ''Mind and Body'', ''Human Nature Explored'', ''Consciousness Recovered'', and ''A History of Modern Experimental Psychology''. He was a Fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], received the William James Award from the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], and Fellowship status in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]], and the [[Cognitive Science Society]].

Mandler's professional contributions include the editorship of [[Psychological Review]], Governing Board member and chair of the Psychonomic Society, president of two Divisions of APA (Experimental Psychology and General Psychology), chair of the Council of Editors of APA, chair of the Society for Experimental Psychologists, and founding president of the [[Federation of Behavioral, Psychological, and Cognitive Sciences]].
