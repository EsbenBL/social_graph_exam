{{psychology sidebar}}
The '''Big Five personality traits''' is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for [[personality]] traits,<ref name="Rothmann" /> developed from the 1980s onwards in psychological [[trait theory]]. When [[factor analysis]] (a statistical technique) is applied to [[personality test|personality survey]] data, it reveals semantic associations: some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as [[conscientious]] is more likely to be described as "always prepared" rather than "messy". These associations suggest five broad dimensions used in common language to describe the human personality, [[temperament]] and [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]].<ref name="Goldberg, L. R. (1993).">{{cite journal |vauthors= Goldberg LR |title= The structure of phenotypic personality traits |journal= [[American Psychologist]] |volume= 48 |issue= 1 |pages= 26–34 |date= January 1993 |pmid=8427480 |doi= 10.1037/0003-066x.48.1.26}}</ref><ref name="Costa1992">{{cite book | vauthors= Costa PT, McCrae RR |date= 1992 |title= Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) manual |location= [[Odessa, Florida]] |publisher= Psychological Assessment Resources}}</ref>

The theory identifies five factors:
* [[openness to experience]] (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
*[[conscientiousness]] (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
*[[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]] (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
* [[agreeableness]] (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
* [[neuroticism]] (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167202289008|doi = 10.1177/0146167202289008|title = The Big Five Personality Factors and Personal Values|year = 2002|last1 = Roccas|first1 = Sonia|last2 = Sagiv|first2 = Lilach|last3 = Schwartz|first3 = Shalom H.|last4 = Knafo|first4 = Ariel|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume = 28|issue = 6|pages = 789–801|s2cid = 144611052}}</ref>

The five factors may be remembered using the acronyms "OCEAN" or "CANOE". Beneath each proposed global factor, there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors. For example, extraversion is typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, warmth, activity, and [[positive emotions]].<ref>{{cite book | title= Personality Traits |last1= Matthews |first1= Gerald |last2= Deary |first2= Ian J. |last3= Whiteman |first3= Martha C. |name-list-style= vanc |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-521-83107-9 |edition= 2nd |url= http://elib.fk.uwks.ac.id/asset/archieve/e-book/PSYCHIATRIC-%20ILMU%20PENYAKIT%20JIWA/Personality%20Traits,%202nd%20Ed.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141205103724/http://elib.fk.uwks.ac.id/asset/archieve/e-book/PSYCHIATRIC-%20ILMU%20PENYAKIT%20JIWA/Personality%20Traits%2C%202nd%20Ed.pdf |archive-date= 2014-12-05 }}</ref> These traits are not black and white, but rather placed on continua.<ref name=":18" />

[[Twin studies]] and other research have shown that about half of the variation between individuals results from their genetic inheritance and half from their environment. Researchers have found conscientiousness, extraversion, openness to experience, and neuroticism to be relatively stable from middle age through old age.<ref>Leon G.

The Big Five personality traits was the model to comprehend the relationship between personality and [[Academic achievement|academic behaviors]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Poropat AE | title = A meta-analysis of the five-factor model of personality and academic performance | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 135 | issue = 2 | pages = 322–38 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19254083 | doi = 10.1037/a0014996 | hdl = 10072/30324 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> This model was defined by several independent sets of researchers who used factor analysis of verbal descriptors of human behavior.<ref name=Digman>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Digman JM | year = 1990 | title = Personality structure: Emergence of the five-factor model | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 41 | pages = 417–40 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.41.020190.002221 }}</ref> These researchers began by studying relationships between a large number of verbal descriptors related to personality traits.

==Descriptions of the particular personality traits==

===Openness to experience===

[[Openness to experience]] is a general appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience. People who are open to experience are intellectually curious, open to emotion, sensitive to beauty and willing to try new things. They tend to be, when compared to closed people, more creative and more aware of their feelings. They are also more likely to hold unconventional beliefs. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behavior or drug-taking.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZT2eAwAAQBAJ|title=Psy-Q: You know your IQ – now test your psychological intelligence|last=Ambridge|first=Ben|year=2014|publisher=Profile|isbn=978-1782830238|page=11|name-list-style=vanc|via=Google Books}}</ref> Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue [[self-actualization]] specifically by [[Peak experience|seeking out intense, euphoric experiences]]. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven{{snd}}sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor as there is a lack of biological support for this particular trait compared to the other four traits.{{Clarify|date=December 2017}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeYoung|first=Colin G.|last2=Hirsh|first2=Jacob B.|last3=Shane|first3=Matthew S.|last4=Papademetris|first4=Xenophon|last5=Rajeevan|first5=Nallakkandi|last6=Gray|first6=Jeremy R.|date=2010|title=Testing Predictions From Personality Neuroscience: Brain Structure and the Big Five|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41062296|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=6|pages=820–828|issn=0956-7976}}</ref>

===Conscientiousness===
[[Conscientiousness]] is a tendency to display [[self-discipline]], act dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations. It is related to the way in which people control, regulate, and direct their impulses. High conscientiousness is often perceived as being stubborn and focused. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.<ref name="sloanreview.mit.edu" /> High scores on conscientiousness indicate a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Costa PT, McCrae RR | date =  1992 | title = Neo PI-R professional manual. | location = Odessa, FL  | publisher = Psychological Assessment Resources|page= | isbn=}}{{page?|date=June 2021}}{{ISBN?}}</ref> The average level of conscientiousness rises among young adults and then declines among older adults.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Reports on Science from Michigan State University Provide New Insights|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/suic/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=News&disableHighlighting=false&prodId=SUIC&action=e&windowstate=normal&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CA283740201&mode=view|work=Science Letter|publisher=Gale Student Resource in Context|access-date=4 April 2012}}</ref>

*I make a mess of things. (''Reversed'')
*I often forget to put things back in their proper place. (''Reversed'')
*I shirk my duties. (''Reversed'')

===Extraversion===
[[Extraversion and introversion|Extraversion]] is characterized by breadth of activities (as opposed to depth), [[surgency]] from external activity/situations, and energy creation from external means.<ref>{{cite book | first = Marti Olsen | last = Laney | name-list-style = vanc | title = The Introvert Advantage | year = 2002 | publisher = Thomas Allen & Son Limited | location = Canada | pages = [https://archive.org/details/introvertadvanta00mart/page/28 28], 35 | isbn = 978-0761123699 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/introvertadvanta00mart }}</ref> The trait is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as full of energy. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented individuals. They possess high group visibility, like to talk, and assert themselves. Extraverted people may appear more dominant in social settings, as opposed to introverted people in this setting.<ref name="Friedman_2016">{{cite book|title=Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research|last1=Friedman|first1=Howard|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam|date=2016|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|isbn=978-0205997930|edition=Sixth|name-list-style=vanc|page=}}{{page?|date=June 2021}}</ref>

Introverts have lower social engagement and energy levels than extraverts. They tend to seem quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less involved in the social world. Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression; instead they are more independent of their social world than extraverts. Introverts need less stimulation, and more time alone than extraverts. This does not mean that they are unfriendly or antisocial; rather, they are reserved in social situations.<ref name="Rothmann">{{cite journal| vauthors = Rothmann S, Coetzer EP |title=The big five personality dimensions and job performance |journal=SA Journal of Industrial Psychology |date=24 October 2003 |volume=29 |doi=10.4102/sajip.v29i1.88 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Generally, people are a combination of extraversion and introversion, with personality psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]] suggesting a model by which individual neurological differences produce these traits.<ref name = "Friedman_2016" />{{rp|106}}

*I keep in the background. (''Reversed'')
*I have little to say. (''Reversed'')
* I do not like to draw attention to myself. (''Reversed'')
* I am quiet around strangers. (''Reversed'')

===Agreeableness===
The [[agreeableness]] trait reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others.<ref name=Rothmann/> Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature.

Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and are less likely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.<ref>{{cite web | title = "Daisy, daisy, give me your answer do!" switching off a robot|pages=217–22|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6251692| vauthors = Bartneck C, Van der Hoek M, Mubin O, Al Mahmud A | publisher = Dept. of Ind. Design, Eindhoven Univ. of Technol. | location = Eindhoven, Netherlands|access-date=6 February 2013|date=March 2007}}</ref> Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy.<ref name="sloanreview.mit.edu" />

Because agreeableness is a social trait, research has shown that one's agreeableness positively correlates with the quality of relationships with one's team members. Agreeableness also positively predicts [[transformational leadership]] skills. In a study conducted among 169 participants in leadership positions in a variety of professions, individuals were asked to take a personality test and have two evaluations completed by directly supervised subordinates. Leaders with high levels of agreeableness were more likely to be considered transformational rather than [[transactional leadership|transactional]]. Although the relationship was not strong (''[[Pearson correlation coefficient|r=0.32]]'', ''[[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|&beta;=0.28]]'', ''[[P-value|p<0.01]]''), it was the strongest of the Big Five traits. However, the same study showed no predictive power of leadership effectiveness as evaluated by the leader's direct supervisor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Judge TA, Bono JE | title = Five-factor model of personality and transformational leadership | journal = The Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 85 | issue = 5 | pages = 751–65 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11055147 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.85.5.751 }}</ref>

Conversely, agreeableness has been found to be negatively related to transactional leadership in the military. A study of Asian military units showed leaders with a high level of agreeableness to be more likely to receive a low rating for transformational leadership skills.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lim BC, Ployhart RE | title = Transformational leadership: relations to the five-factor model and team performance in typical and maximum contexts | journal = The Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 610–21 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15327348 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.610 }}</ref> Therefore, with further research, organizations may be able to determine an individual's potential for performance based on their personality traits. For instance,<ref name=":17">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sackett PR, Walmsley PT | year = 2014| title = Which Personality Attributes Are Most Important in the Workplace? | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume =  9| issue = 5| pages =  538–51| doi = 10.1177/1745691614543972 | pmid = 26186756| s2cid = 21245818}}</ref> in their journal article "Which Personality Attributes Are Most Important in the Workplace?" Paul Sackett and Philip Walmsley claim that conscientiousness and agreeableness are “important to success across many different jobs."

Those who score high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress. They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening. They can perceive minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. They also tend to be flippant in the way they express emotions. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. For instance, neuroticism is connected to a pessimistic approach toward work, to certainty that work impedes personal relationships, and to higher levels of anxiety from the pressures at work.<ref name="neuro1">{{cite book | vauthors = Fiske ST, Gilbert DT, Lindzey G |year=2009 |title=Handbook of Social Psychology |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley|page=|isbn=}}{{ISBN?}}{{page?|date=June 2021}}</ref> Furthermore, those who score high on neuroticism may display more [[Electrodermal_activity|skin-conductance reactivity]] than those who score low on neuroticism.<ref name="Norris, Larsen 2007"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reynaud E, El Khoury-Malhame M, Rossier J, Blin O, Khalfa S | title = Neuroticism modifies psycho physiological responses to fearful films | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e32413 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22479326 | pmc = 3316522 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0032413 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...732413R | doi-access = free }}</ref> These problems in emotional regulation can diminish the ability of a person scoring high on neuroticism to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively with stress.

At the other end of the scale, individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings.

Neuroticism is similar but not identical to being neurotic in the Freudian sense (i.e., [[neurosis]]). Some psychologists prefer to call neuroticism by the term emotional instability to differentiate it from the term neurotic in a career test.

==History==

===Early trait research===
Historically preceding the Big Five personality traits (B5) or the Five Factors Model (FFM) was [[Hippocrates]]'s four types of temperament: [[Sanguine temperament|sanguine]], [[phlegmatic]], [[choleric]], and [[Four temperaments|melancholic]]. The sanguine type is most closely related to emotional stability and extraversion, the phlegmatic type is also stable but introverted, the choleric type is unstable and extraverted, and the melancholic type is unstable and introverted.<ref name=":15">{{Cite book|title=The General Factor of Personality|last=Musek|first=Janek|publisher=Academic Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-12-811249-6|location=London|pages=14–25}}</ref>

In 1884, [[Sir Francis Galton]] was the first person who is known to have investigated the hypothesis that it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human personality traits by sampling language: the [[lexical hypothesis]].<ref name=":2" />

In 1936, [[Gordon Allport]] and S. Odbert put Sir Francis Galton's hypothesis into practice by extracting 4,504 adjectives which they believed were descriptive of observable and relatively permanent traits from the dictionaries at that time.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allport GW, Odbert HS | year = 1936 | title = Trait names: A psycholexical study | journal = Psychological Monographs | volume = 47 | page = 211 | doi = 10.1037/h0093360 }}</ref> 
In 1940, [[Raymond Cattell]] retained the adjectives, and eliminated synonyms to reduce the total to 171.<ref name="Cattell 1957" /> He constructed a self-report instrument for the clusters of personality traits he found from the adjectives, which he called the [[Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire]].

In 1949, the first systematic multivariate research of personality was conducted by [[J. P. Guilford|Joy P. Guilford]]. Guilford analyzed ten factors of personality, which he measured by the [[Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey]]. These scales included general activity (energy vs inactivity); restraint (seriousness vs impulsiveness); ascendance (social boldness vs submissiveness); sociability (social interest vs shyness); emotional stability (evenness vs fluctuation of mood); objectivity (thick-skinned vs hypersensitive); friendliness (agreeableness vs belligerence); thoughtfulness (reflective vs disconnected), personal relations (tolerance vs hypercritical); masculinity (hard-boiled vs sympathetic).<ref name=":15"/> These overlapping scales were later further analyzed by Guilford et al., and condensed into three dimensions: social activity (general activity, ascendence, sociability), introversion-extraversion (restraint, thoughtfulness), and emotional health (emotional stability, objectivity, friendliness, personal relations).<ref name=":15" />

Based on a subset of only 20 of the 36 dimensions that Cattell had originally discovered, Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal (1961) claimed to have found just five broad factors which they labeled: "surgency", "agreeableness", "dependability", "emotional stability", and "culture".<ref name=":4" /> Warren Norman subsequently relabeled "dependability" as "conscientiousness".<ref name=":5" />

===Hiatus in research===
During the late 1960s to 1970s, the changing [[zeitgeist]] made publication of personality research difficult. 
In his 1968 book ''Personality and Assessment'', [[Walter Mischel]] asserted that personality instruments could not predict behavior with a [[correlation]] of more than 0.3. [[social psychology (psychology)|Social psychologists]] like Mischel argued that attitudes and behavior were not stable, but varied with the situation. Predicting behavior from personality instruments was claimed to be impossible.{{by whom|date=April 2019}}<!--we need more than one primary reference to establish that this amounts to a "hiatus" due to "zeitgeist".-->

===Renewed attention===
The paradigm shift back to acceptance of the five-factor model came in the early 1980s.
In a 1980 symposium in [[Honolulu]], four prominent researchers, Lewis Goldberg, [[Naomi Takemoto-Chock]], Andrew Comrey, and John M. Digman, reviewed the available personality instruments of the day.<ref>{{cite report | vauthors = Goldberg LR | date = May 1980 | title = Some ruminations about the structure of individual differences: Developing a common lexicon for the major characteristics of human personality | work = Symposium presentation at the meeting of the Western Psychological Association | location = Honolulu, HI | page=}}{{page?|date=June 2021}}</ref> 
This event was followed by widespread acceptance of the five-factor model among personality researchers during the 1980s.

By 1983, experiments had demonstrated that the predictions of personality models correlated better with real-life behavior under stressful emotional conditions, as opposed to typical survey administration under neutral emotional conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyle GJ | title = Effects on academic learning of manipulating emotional states and motivational dynamics | journal = The British Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 53 | issue =  3| pages = 347–57 | date = November 1983 | pmid = 6652035 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8279.1983.tb02567.x }}</ref>
[[Peter Saville (psychologist)|Peter Saville]] and his team included the five-factor "Pentagon" model with the original [[Occupational Personality Questionnaires|OPQ]] in 1984. Pentagon was closely followed by the [[NEO PI-R|NEO]] five-factor personality inventory, published by Costa and McCrae in 1985. However, the methodology employed in constructing the NEO instrument has been subject to critical scrutiny (see section below).<ref name = "Boyle_1995">{{cite book | vauthors = Boyle GJ, Stankov L, Cattell RB | date = 1995 | chapter = Measurement and statistical models in the study of personality and intelligence | veditors = Saklofske DH, Zeidner M | title = International Handbook of Personality and Intelligence |isbn=| pages = 417–46 }}{{ISBN?}}</ref>{{rp|431–33}}

Emerging methodologies increasingly confirmed personality theories during the 1980s. Though generally failing to predict single instances of behavior, researchers found that they could predict patterns of behavior by aggregating large numbers of observations.<ref name="person-situation debate">{{cite journal | vauthors = Epstein S, O'Brien EJ | title = The person-situation debate in historical and current perspective | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 513–37 | date = November 1985 | pmid = 4080897 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.98.3.513 }}</ref> As a result, correlations between personality and behavior increased substantially, and it was clear that "personality" did in fact exist.<ref name=profiting>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kenrick DT, Funder DC | title = Profiting from controversy.

Colin G. DeYoung et al. (2016) tested how these 25 facets could be integrated with the 10-factor structure of traits within the Big Five. The developers mainly researched the Big Five model and how the five broad factors are compatible with the 25 scales of the [[Personality test|Personality Inventory]] (PID-5) for the DSM-5.

==Biological and developmental factors==
There of course are factors that influence a personality and these are called the determinants of personality. These factors determine the traits which a person develops in the course of development from a child.

===Temperament vis-à-vis personality===

There are debates between researchers of [[temperament]] and researchers of [[personality]] as to whether or not biologically based differences define a concept of temperament or a part of personality. The presence of such differences in pre-cultural individuals (such as animals or young infants) suggests that they belong to temperament since personality is a socio-cultural concept. For this reason developmental psychologists generally interpret individual differences in children as an expression of temperament rather than personality.<ref name="Rothbart, M. K. 2000"/> Some researchers argue that temperaments and personality traits are age-specific manifestations of virtually the same latent qualities.<ref name="Shiner, R. 2003"/><ref name=":9">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCrae RR, Costa PT, Ostendorf F, Angleitner A, Hrebícková M, Avia MD, Sanz J, Sánchez-Bernardos ML, Kusdil ME, Woodfield R, Saunders PR, Smith PB | title = Nature over nurture: temperament, personality, and life span development | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 173–86 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10653513 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.78.1.173 }}</ref> Some believe that early childhood temperaments may become adolescent and adult personality traits as individuals' basic genetic characteristics actively, reactively, and passively interact with their changing environments.<ref name="Rothbart, M.

Researchers of adult temperament point out that, similarly to sex, age and mental illness, temperament is based on biochemical systems whereas personality is a product of socialization of an individual possessing these four types of features. Temperament interacts with social-cultural factors, but still cannot be controlled or easily changed by these factors.<ref name=Rusal89>{{cite journal|year=1989|vauthors = Rusalov VM|title=Motor and communicative aspects of human temperament: a new questionnaire of the structure of temperament. |journal=Personality and Individual Differences| volume=10|issue = 8| pages=817–27|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(89)90017-2}}</ref><ref name=Strelau>{{cite book | year=1998| vauthors = Strelau J  |title=Temperament: A Psychological Perspective. | location = New York | publisher = Plenum}}</ref><ref name=Manual>{{cite book | year=2007| vauthors = Rusalov VM, Trofimova IN |title=Structure of Temperament and Its Measurement |location=Toronto, Canada |publisher=Psychological Services Press }}{{page needed|date=December 2017}}</ref><ref name=FET>{{cite book |year=2016 | vauthors = Trofimova IN |chapter=The interlocking between functional aspects of activities and a neurochemical model of adult temperament | veditors = MC |title=Temperaments: Individual Differences, Social and Environmental Influences and Impact on Quality of Life |location=New York |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |pages=77–147}}</ref>
Therefore, it is suggested that temperament should be kept as an independent concept for further studies and not be conflated with personality.<ref name=PTRS-B/> Moreover, temperament refers to dynamical features of behavior (energetic, tempo, sensitivity and emotionality-related), whereas personality is to be considered a psycho-social construct comprising the content characteristics of human behavior (such as values, attitudes, habits, preferences, personal history, self-image).<ref name=Strelau /><ref name=Manual /><ref name=FET/> Temperament researchers point out that the lack of attention to extant temperament research by the developers of the Big Five model lead to an overlap between its dimensions and dimensions described in multiple temperament models much earlier. For example, neuroticism reflects the traditional temperament dimension of emotionality, extraversion the temperament dimension of "energy" or "activity", and openness to experience the temperament dimension of sensation-seeking.<ref name=FET /><ref name=TroAmP>{{cite journal|year=2010| vauthors = Trofimova IN | title=An investigation into differences between the structure of temperament and the structure of personality |journal=American Journal of Psychology | volume=123 | issue = 4 | pages=467–80|doi=10.5406/amerjpsyc.123.4.0467| pmid = 21291163 }}</ref>

===Heritability===

[[File:Retos-twins.jpg|thumb|Personality research conducted on twin subjects suggests that both heritable and environmental factors contribute to the Big Five personality traits.]]
[[Behavioural genetics|Genetically informative]] research, including [[twin studies]], suggest that [[heritability]] and environmental factors both influence all five factors to the same degree.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jang KL, Livesley WJ, Vernon PA | title = Heritability of the big five personality dimensions and their facets: a twin study | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 577–91 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 8776880 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00522.x }}</ref> Among four recent twin studies, the mean percentage for heritability was calculated for each personality and it was concluded that heritability influenced the five factors broadly.

===Non-humans===
[[File:2006-12-09 Chipanzees D Bruyere.JPG|thumb|The Big 5 personality traits can be seen in chimpanzees.]]

The Big Five personality traits have been assessed in some non-human species but methodology is debatable. In one series of studies, human ratings of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s using the [[Hominoid Personality Questionnaire]], revealed factors of extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness&nbsp;– as well as an additional factor of dominance&nbsp;– across hundreds of chimpanzees in [[zoological park]]s, a large naturalistic sanctuary, and a research laboratory.

===Development throughout adulthood===
Many studies of [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] data, which correlate people's test scores over time, and [[cross-sectional]] data, which compare personality levels across different age groups, show a high degree of stability in personality traits during adulthood, especially Neuroticism trait that is often regarded as a temperament trait <ref>{{cite book | vauthors = McCrae RR, Costa PT | date = 1990 | title = Personality in adulthood. | location = New York | publisher = The Guildford Press }}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}</ref> similarly to longitudinal research in temperament for the same traits.<ref name=Kagan/> It is shown that the personality stabilizes for working-age individuals within about four years after starting working. There is also little evidence that adverse life events can have any significant impact on the personality of individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.econlet.2011.11.015 | vauthors = Cobb-Clark DA, Schurer S | year = 2012 | title = The stability of big-five personality traits | journal = Economics Letters | volume = 115 | issue = 2| pages = 11–15 | s2cid = 12086995 | url = http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/downloads/working_paper_series/wp2011n21.pdf }}</ref> More recent research and meta-analyses of previous studies, however, indicate that [[Change in personality over a lifetime|change occurs]] in all five traits at various points in the lifespan. The new research shows evidence for a [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|maturation]] effect. On average, levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness typically increase with time, whereas extraversion, neuroticism, and openness tend to decrease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Srivastava S, John OP, Gosling SD, Potter J | title = Development of personality in early and middle adulthood: set like plaster or persistent change? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 5 | pages = 1041–53 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12757147 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.84.5.1041 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.499.4124 }}</ref> Research has also demonstrated that changes in Big Five personality traits depend on the individual's current stage of development.

In addition, some research (Fleeson, 2001) suggests that the Big Five should not be conceived of as dichotomies (such as extraversion vs. introversion) but as continua. Each individual has the capacity to move along each dimension as circumstances (social or temporal) change. He is or she is therefore not simply on one end of each trait dichotomy but is a blend of both, exhibiting some characteristics more often than others:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleeson W | year = 2001 | title = Towards a structure- and process-integrated view of personality: Traits as density distributions of states | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = 6| pages = 1011–27 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.1011| pmid = 11414368 }}</ref>

Research regarding personality with growing age has suggested that as individuals enter their elder years (79–86), those with lower IQ see a raise in extraversion, but a decline in conscientiousness and physical well-being.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=René |last1=Mõttus |first2=Wendy |last2=Johnson |first3=John M. |last3=Starr |first4=Ian J. |last4=Dearya | name-list-style = vanc |date=June 2012 |title=Correlates of personality trait levels and their changes in very old age: The Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=271–78 |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2012.02.004|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/15012527/Figure_1_without_legend.pdf |hdl=20.500.11820/b6b6961d-902f-48e0-bf25-f505a659a056 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

Research by Cobb-Clark and [[Kevin Schürer|Schurer]] indicates that personality traits are generally stable among adult workers.

=== Personality change from disease ===
While personality is mostly stable in adulthood, some diseases can alter personality. Gradual impairment of memory is the hallmark feature of [[Alzheimer's disease]], but changes in personality also commonly occur. A review of personality change in Alzheimer's disease found a characteristic pattern of personality change in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a large decrease in Conscientiousness of two to three standard deviations, a decrease in Extraversion of one to two standard deviations, a reduction in Agreeableness of less than one standard deviation, and an increase in Neuroticism of between one and two standard deviations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robins Wahlin TB, Byrne GJ | title = Personality changes in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review | journal = International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1019–29 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21905097 | doi = 10.1002/gps.2655 | s2cid = 40949990 }}</ref>

===Gender differences===

A study of gender differences in 55 nations using the Big Five Inventory found that women tended to be somewhat higher than men in neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The difference in neuroticism was the most prominent and consistent, with significant differences found in 49 of the 55 nations surveyed. 

Gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous, healthy, and more gender-egalitarian nations. The explanation for this given by the researchers of a 2001 paper is that acts by women in individualistic, egalitarian countries are more likely to be attributed to their personality, rather than being attributed to ascribed gender roles within collectivist, traditional countries.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> 

Measured differences in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were caused by the changes in the measured personalities of men, not women, in these respective regions. That is, men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic, less extraverted, less conscientious and less agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions. Women, on the other hand tended not to differ in personality traits across regions.<ref name="55nations">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmitt DP, Realo A, Voracek M, Allik J | title = Why can't a man be more like a woman?

The authors of this 2008 study speculated that resource-poor environments (that is, countries with low levels of development) may inhibit the development of gender differences, whereas resource-rich environments facilitate them. This may be because males require more resources than females in order to reach their full personality potential of less conscientious, less agreeable, less neurotic, and less extraverted. The authors also speculated in their discussion that due to different evolutionary pressures, men may have evolved to be more risk taking and socially dominant, whereas women evolved to be more cautious and nurturing. The authors further posited that ancient hunter-gatherer societies may have been more egalitarian than later agriculturally oriented societies. Hence, the development of gender inequalities may have acted to constrain the development of gender differences in personality that originally evolved in hunter-gatherer societies. As modern societies have become more egalitarian, again, it may be that innate sex differences are no longer constrained and hence manifest more fully than in less-wealthy cultures.<ref name="55nations" /> This is one interpretation of the results among other possible interpretations.

===Birth-order differences===
{{main|Birth order}}
[[Frank Sulloway]] argues that firstborns are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns.

In 2002, the journal of psychology posted a Big Five Personality Trait Difference; Researchers explored relationship between the five factor model and the Universal-Diverse Orientation (UDO) in counselor trainees. (Thompson, R., Brossart, D., and Mivielle, A., 2002) UDO is known as one social attitude that produces a strong awareness and/or acceptance towards the similarities and differences amongst individuals. (Miville, M., Romas, J., Johnson, J., and Lon, R. 2002) The study has shown the counselor trainees that are more open to the idea of creative expression (a facet of Openness to Experience, Openness to Aesthetics) amongst individuals are more likely to work with a diverse group of clients, and feel comfortable in their role.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson RL, Brossart DF, Carlozzi AF, Miville ML | title = Five-factor model (Big Five) personality traits and universal-diverse orientation in counselor trainees | journal = The Journal of Psychology | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 561–72 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12431039 | doi = 10.1080/00223980209605551 | s2cid = 22076221 }}</ref>

Recent work has found relationships between [[Geert Hofstede]]'s [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|cultural factors]], Individualism, Power Distance, Masculinity, and Uncertainty Avoidance, with the average Big Five scores in a country.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCrae RR, Terracciano A | title = Personality profiles of cultures: aggregate personality traits | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–25 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16248722 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.407 | author3 = Personality Profiles of Cultures Project | url = http://idiprints.knjiznica.idi.hr/649/1/JoPaSP%202005_3%20Mccrae%20et%20al..pdf }}</ref> For instance, the degree to which a country values individualism correlates with its average extraversion, whereas people living in cultures which are accepting of large inequalities in their power structures tend to score somewhat higher on conscientiousness.

Personality differences around the world might even have contributed to the emergence of different political systems. A recent study has found that countries' average personality trait levels are correlated with their political systems: countries with higher average trait Openness tended to have more democratic institutions, an association that held even after factoring out other relevant influences such as economic development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barceló|first=Joan | name-list-style = vanc |date=2017 |title=National Personality Traits and Regime Type: A Cross-National Study of 47 Countries |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=48  |issue=2 |pages=195–216 |doi=10.1177/0022022116678324 |s2cid=151607260 }}</ref>

====The personality-psychopathology models====

Five major models have been posed to explain the nature of the relationship between personality and mental illness. There is currently no single "best model", as each of them has received at least some empirical support. It is also important to note that these models are not mutually exclusive – more than one may be operating for a particular individual and various mental disorders may be explained by different models.<ref name="NeuroticismMA"/><ref>{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Personality Disorders |url = https://archive.org/details/handbookpersonal00mdwj_893 |url-access = limited | first = W John | last = Livesley | name-list-style = vanc  |year = 2001 |location = New York| publisher = The Guildford Press | pages = [https://archive.org/details/handbookpersonal00mdwj_893/page/n98 84]–104 | isbn = 978-1-57230-629-5 | oclc = 783011161 }}</ref>
* '''The Vulnerability/Risk Model:''' According to this model, personality contributes to the onset or etiology of various common mental disorders. In other words, pre-existing personality traits either cause the development of CMDs directly or enhance the impact of causal risk factors.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ormel J, Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Bos EH, Hankin B, Rosmalen JG, Oldehinkel AJ | title = Neuroticism and common mental disorders: meaning and utility of a complex relationship | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 686–97 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23702592 | pmc = 4382368 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2013.04.003 }}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title = Contemporary Directions in Psychopathology: Scientific Foundations of the DSM-IV and ICD-11 | vauthors = Millon T, Krueger R, Simonsen E |publisher = Guilford Press|year = 2011}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite book|title = Personality and Psychopathology | vauthors = Krueger R, Tackett L |publisher = Guilford Press|year = 2006|isbn=|page=}}{{page?|date=June 2021}}{{ISBN?}}</ref> There is strong support for neuroticism being a robust vulnerability factor.<ref name="NeuroticismMA"/>
* '''The Pathoplasty Model:''' This model proposes that premorbid personality traits impact the expression, course, severity, and/or treatment response of a mental disorder.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":7" /><ref name=":18">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Bolle M, Beyers W, De Clercq B, De Fruyt F | title = General personality and psychopathology in referred and nonreferred children and adolescents: an investigation of continuity, pathoplasty, and complication models | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 958–70 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22448741 | doi = 10.1037/a0027742 }}</ref> An example of this relationship would be a heightened likelihood of committing suicide in a depressed individual who also has low levels of constraint.<ref name=":7" />
* '''The Common Cause Model:''' According to the common cause model, personality traits are predictive of CMDs because personality and psychopathology have shared genetic and environmental determinants which result in non-causal associations between the two constructs.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6" />
* '''The Spectrum Model:''' This model proposes that associations between personality and psychopathology are found because these two constructs both occupy a single domain or spectrum and psychopathology is simply a display of the extremes of normal personality function.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" /> Support for this model is provided by an issue of criterion overlap. For instance, two of the primary facet scales of neuroticism in the NEO-PI-R are "depression" and "anxiety". Thus the fact that diagnostic criteria for depression, anxiety, and neuroticism assess the same content increases the correlations between these domains.<ref name=":8" />
* '''The Scar Model:''' According to the scar model, episodes of a mental disorder 'scar' an individual's personality, changing it in significant ways from premorbid functioning.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" /> An example of a scar effect would be a decrease in openness to experience following an episode of PTSD.<ref name=":7" />

===Health===
To examine how the Big Five personality traits are related to subjective health outcomes (positive and negative mood, physical symptoms, and general health concern) and objective health conditions (chronic illness, serious illness, and physical injuries), Jasna Hudek-Knezevic and Igor Kardum conducted a study from a sample of 822 healthy volunteers (438 women and 384 men).<ref name=":03">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hudek-Knezević J, Kardum I | title = Five-factor personality dimensions and 3 health-related personality constructs as predictors of health | journal = Croatian Medical Journal | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 394–402 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19673040 | pmc = 2728392 | doi = 10.3325/cmj.2009.50.394 }}</ref> Out of the Big Five personality traits, they found neuroticism most related to worse subjective health outcomes and optimistic control to better subjective health outcomes.

===Education===

====Academic achievement====

Personality plays an important role in academic achievement. A study of 308 undergraduates who completed the Five Factor Inventory Processes and reported their [[Grading in education|GPA]] suggested that conscientiousness and agreeableness have a positive relationship with all types of learning styles (synthesis-analysis, methodical study, fact retention, and elaborative processing), whereas neuroticism shows an inverse relationship. Moreover, extraversion and openness were proportional to elaborative processing. The Big Five personality traits accounted for 14% of the variance in GPA, suggesting that personality traits make some contributions to academic performance. Furthermore, reflective learning styles (synthesis-analysis and elaborative processing) were able to mediate the relationship between openness and GPA. These results indicate that intellectual curiosity significantly enhances academic performance if students combine their scholarly interest with thoughtful information processing.<ref name = "Komarraju_2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Komarraju M, Karau SJ, Schmeck RR, Avdic A | title = The Big Five personality traits, learning styles, and academic achievement. | journal =Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 472–77 | date=September 2011 |doi= 10.1016/j.paid.2011.04.019 }}</ref>

A recent study of Israeli high-school students found that those in the gifted program systematically scored higher on [[openness]] and lower on [[neuroticism]] than those not in the gifted program. While not a measure of the Big Five, gifted students also reported less state anxiety than students not in the gifted program.<ref name=Zeidner>{{cite journal| vauthors = Zeidner M, Shani-Zinovich I |title=Do academically gifted and nongifted students differ on the Big-Five and adaptive status?

Studies conducted on college students have concluded that hope, which is linked to agreeableness, has a positive effect on psychological well-being. Individuals high in neurotic tendencies are less likely to display hopeful tendencies and are negatively associated with well-being.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh AK | year = 2012 | title = Does trait predict psychological well-being among students of professional courses?. | journal = [[Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 234–41 }}</ref> Personality can sometimes be flexible and measuring the big five personality for individuals as they enter certain stages of life may predict their educational identity. Recent studies have suggested the likelihood of an individual's personality affecting their educational identity.<ref name="Klimstra 2011"/>

====Learning styles====
[[Learning styles]] have been described as "enduring ways of thinking and processing information".<ref name = "Komarraju_2011" />

In 2008, the [[Association for Psychological Science]] (APS) commissioned a report that concludes that no significant evidence exists that learning-style assessments should be included in the education system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pashler H, McDaniel M, Rohrer D, Bjork R | title = Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 105–19 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 26162104 | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> Thus it is premature, at best, to conclude that the evidence links the Big Five to "learning styles", or "learning styles" to learning itself.

However, the APS report also suggested that all existing learning styles have not been exhausted and that there could exist learning styles worthy of being included in educational practices. There are studies that conclude that personality and thinking styles may be intertwined in ways that link thinking styles to the Big Five personality traits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Li-fang | name-list-style = vanc | title=Measuring thinking styles in addition to measuring personality traits?|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=6 September 2001|volume=33|issue=3 |pages=445–58|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(01)00166-0}}</ref> There is no general consensus on the number or specifications of particular learning styles, but there have been many different proposals.

As one example, Schmeck, Ribich, and Ramanaiah (1997) defined four types of learning styles:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmeck RR, Ribich F, Ramainah N | title = Development of a Self-Report inventory for assessing Individual Differences in Learning Processes | journal=Applied Psychological Measurement|volume = 1| issue = 3 |pages = 413–31 | date=1997 | doi = 10.1177/014662167700100310| s2cid = 143890188 | url = http://purl.umn.edu/98563 }}</ref>

*synthesis analysis
*methodical study
*fact retention
*elaborative processing

When all four facets are implicated within the classroom, they will each likely improve academic achievement.<ref name = "Komarraju_2011" /> This model asserts that students develop either agentic/shallow processing or reflective/deep processing. Deep processors are more often found to be more conscientious, intellectually open, and extraverted than shallow processors. Deep processing is associated with appropriate study methods (methodical study) and a stronger ability to analyze information (synthesis analysis), whereas shallow processors prefer structured fact retention learning styles and are better suited for elaborative processing.<ref name="Komarraju_2011"/> The main functions of these four specific learning styles are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! Function
|-
| Synthesis analysis: || processing information, forming categories, and organizing them into hierarchies. This is the only one of the learning styles that has explained a significant impact on academic performance.<ref name="Komarraju_2011"/>
|-
| Methodical study: || methodical behavior while completing academic assignments
|-
| Fact retention: || focusing on the actual result instead of understanding the logic behind something
|-
| Elaborative processing: || connecting and applying new ideas to existing knowledge
|}

Openness has been linked to learning styles that often lead to academic success and higher grades like synthesis analysis and methodical study. Because conscientiousness and openness have been shown to predict all four learning styles, it suggests that individuals who possess characteristics like discipline, determination, and curiosity are more likely to engage in all of the above learning styles.<ref name="Komarraju_2011"/>

According to the research carried out by Komarraju, Karau, Schmeck & Avdic (2011), conscientiousness and agreeableness are positively related with all four learning styles, whereas neuroticism was negatively related with those four. Furthermore, extraversion and openness were only positively related to elaborative processing, and openness itself correlated with higher academic achievement.<ref name = "Komarraju_2011" />

In addition, a previous study by psychologist Mikael Jensen has shown relationships between the Big Five personality traits, learning, and academic achievement. According to Jensen, all personality traits, except neuroticism, are associated with learning goals and motivation. Openness and conscientiousness influence individuals to learn to a high degree unrecognized, while extraversion and agreeableness have similar effects.<ref name=":32">{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Mikael|year=2015|title=Personality Traits, Learning and Academic Achievements|journal=Journal of Education and Learning|volume=4|issue=4|pages=91|doi=10.5539/jel.v4n4p91|doi-access=free}}</ref> Conscientiousness and neuroticism also influence individuals to perform well in front of others for a sense of credit and reward, while agreeableness forces individuals to avoid this strategy of learning.<ref name=":32" /> Jensen's study concludes that individuals who score high on the agreeableness trait will likely learn just to perform well in front of others.<ref name=":32" />

Besides openness, all Big Five personality traits helped predict the educational identity of students. Based on these findings, scientists are beginning to see that the Big Five traits might have a large influence of on academic motivation that leads to predicting a student's academic performance.<ref name="Klimstra 2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klimstra TA, Luyckx K, Germeijs V, Meeus WH, Goossens L | title = Personality traits and educational identity formation in late adolescents: longitudinal associations and academic progress | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 346–61 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22147120 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-011-9734-7 | s2cid = 33747401 | url = https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/1461188/OntwikPsy_Klimstra_personality__JoYaA_2012.pdf }}</ref>

Some authors suggested that Big Five personality traits combined with learning styles can help predict some variations in the academic performance and the academic motivation of an individual which can then influence their academic achievements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Feyter|first1=Tim| first2 = Ralf | last2 = Caers | first3 = Claudia | last3 = Vigna | first4 = Dries | last4 = Berings | name-list-style = vanc |title=Unraveling the impact of the Big Five personality traits on academic performance: The moderating and mediating effects of self-efficacy and academic motivation|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|date=22 March 2012|volume=22|issue=4|pages=439–48 |doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2012.03.013|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/409065}}</ref> This may be seen because individual differences in personality represent stable approaches to information processing. For instance, conscientiousness has consistently emerged as a stable predictor of success in exam performance, largely because conscientious students experience fewer study delays.<ref name="Klimstra 2011"/> Conscientiousness shows a positive association with the four learning styles because students with high levels of conscientiousness develop focused learning strategies and appear to be more disciplined and achievement-oriented.

{{Quote|Personality and learning styles are both likely to play significant roles in influencing academic achievement. College students (308 undergraduates) completed the Five Factor Inventory and the Inventory of Learning Processes and reported their grade point average. Two of the Big Five traits, conscientiousness and agreeableness, were positively related with all four learning styles (synthesis analysis, methodical study, fact retention, and elaborative processing), whereas neuroticism was negatively related with all four learning styles. In addition, extraversion and openness were positively related with elaborative processing. The Big Five together explained 14% of the variance in grade point average (GPA), and learning styles explained an additional 3%, suggesting that both personality traits and learning styles contribute to academic performance. Further, the relationship between openness and GPA was mediated by reflective learning styles (synthesis-analysis and elaborative processing). These latter results suggest that being intellectually curious fully enhances academic performance when students combine this scholarly interest with thoughtful information processing. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of teaching techniques and curriculum design.|M Komarraju<ref name = "Komarraju_2011" />}}

====Distance Learning====
When the relationship between the five-factor personality traits and academic achievement in distance education settings was examined in brief, the openness personality trait was found to be the most important variable that has a positive relationship with academic achievement in distance education environments. In addition, it was found that self-discipline, extraversion, and adaptability personality traits are generally in a positive relationship with academic achievement. The most important personality trait that has a negative relationship with academic achievement has emerged as neuroticism. The results generally show that individuals who are organized, planned, determined, who are oriented to new ideas and independent thinking have increased success in distance education environments. On the other hand, it can be said that individuals with anxiety and stress tendencies generally have lower academic success.<ref>Vedel, A. (2014).

===Work success===
[[File:Employees discuss in office.jpg|thumb|Controversy exists as to whether or not the Big 5 personality traits are correlated with success in the workplace.]]
It is believed that the Big Five traits are predictors of future performance outcomes. Job outcome measures include job and training proficiency and personnel data.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mount MK, Barrick MR | year = 1998 | title = Five reasons why the "big five" article has been frequently cited | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 849–57 | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6570.1998.tb00743.x }}</ref> However, research demonstrating such prediction has been criticized, in part because of the apparently low correlation coefficients characterizing the relationship between personality and [[job performance]]. In a 2007 article<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morgeson FP, Campion MA, Dipboye RL, Hollenbeck JR, Murphy K, Schmitt N | year = 2007 | title = Reconsidering the use of personality tests in personnel selection contexts | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 683–729 | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6570.2007.00089.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.493.5981 }}</ref> co-authored by six current or former editors of psychological journals, Dr. Kevin Murphy, Professor of Psychology at Pennsylvania State University and Editor of the ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' (1996–2002), states:

{{Quote|The problem with personality tests is&nbsp;... that the validity of personality measures as predictors of job performance is often disappointingly low. The argument for using personality tests to predict performance does not strike me as convincing in the first place.}}

Such criticisms were put forward by [[Walter Mischel]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Mischel | first = Walter | name-list-style = vanc |title=Personality and assessment | date = 1968 | location = London |publisher= Wiley |isbn=978-0-8058-2330-1}}</ref> whose publication caused a two-decades' long crisis in personality psychometrics. However, later work demonstrated (1) that the correlations obtained by psychometric personality researchers were actually very respectable by comparative standards,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenthal R | year = 1990 | title = How are we doing in soft psychology? | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 45 | issue = 6| pages = 775–77 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.45.6.775}}</ref> and (2) that the economic value of even incremental increases in prediction accuracy was exceptionally large, given the vast difference in performance by those who occupy complex job positions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunter JE, Schmidt FL, Judiesch MK | s2cid = 144507523 | year = 1990 | title = Individual differences in output variability as a function of job complexity | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 75 | pages = 28–42 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.75.1.28}}</ref>

There have been studies that link national innovation to openness to experience and conscientiousness. Those who express these traits have showed leadership and beneficial ideas towards the country of origin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fairweather J | year = 2012 | title = Personality, nations, and innovation: Relationships between personality traits and national innovation scores | journal = Cross-Cultural Research | volume = 46 | pages = 3–30 | doi = 10.1177/1069397111409124 | s2cid = 144015495 }}</ref>

Some businesses, organizations, and interviewers assess individuals based on the Big Five personality traits. Research has suggested that individuals who are considered leaders typically exhibit lower amounts of neurotic traits, maintain higher levels of openness (envisioning success), balanced levels of conscientiousness (well-organized), and balanced levels of extraversion (outgoing, but not excessive).<ref name="pmid12184579">{{cite journal | vauthors = Judge TA, Bono JE, Ilies R, Gerhardt MW | title = Personality and leadership: a qualitative and quantitative review | journal = The Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 765–80 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12184579 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.87.4.765 }}</ref>
Further studies have linked professional burnout to neuroticism, and extraversion to enduring positive work experience.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mehta | first1 = Penkak | name-list-style = vanc | year = 2012 | title = Personality as a predictor of burnout among managers of manufacturing industries.. | journal = Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology | volume = 32 | pages = 321–28 }}</ref> When it comes to making money, research has suggested that those who are high in agreeableness (especially men) are not as successful in accumulating income.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Judge TA, Livingston BA, Hurst C | title = Do nice guys--and gals--really finish last?

Some research suggests that [[vocational]] outcomes are correlated to Big Five personality traits. Conscientiousness predicts job performance in general. Conscientiousness is considered as top-ranked in overall job performance,<ref name=":17" /> research further categorized the Big 5 behaviors into 3 perspectives: task performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behavior. Task performance is the set of activity that a worker is hired to complete, and results showed that Extraversion ranked second after the Conscientiousness, with Emotional Stability tied with Agreeableness ranked third. For organizational citizenship behavior, relatively less tied to the specific task core but benefits an organization by contributing to its social and psychological environment, Agreeableness and Emotional Stability ranked second and third. Lastly, Agreeableness tied with Conscientiousness as top ranked for Counterproductive work behavior, which refers to intentional behavior that is counter to the legitimate interests of the organization or its members.<ref name=":17" />

In addition, research has demonstrated that agreeableness is negatively related to [[salary]]. Those high in agreeableness make less, on average, than those low in the same trait. Neuroticism is also negatively related to salary while conscientiousness and extraversion are positive predictors of salary.<ref name="Spurk">{{cite journal|last1=Spurk|first1=Daniel|first2 = Andrea E. | last2 = Abele | name-list-style = vanc |title=Who Earns More and Why?

Significant predictors of career-advancement goals are: extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness.<ref name="Spurk" /> Some research has also suggested that the Conscientiousness of a supervisor is positively associated with an employee's perception of abusive supervision.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Camps J, Stouten J, Euwema M | title = The relation between supervisors' big five personality traits and employees' experiences of abusive supervision| journal = Frontiers in Psychology | date = February 2016 | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = 112 | pmc = 4748047 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00112 | pmid = 26903919| doi-access = free}}</ref> While others have suggested that those with low agreeableness and high neuroticism are traits more related to abusive supervision.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tepper BJ | title = Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda. | journal = Journal of Management | date = June 2007 | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–89 | doi = 10.1177/0149206307300812 | s2cid = 143934380 }}</ref>

A 2019 study of Canadian adults found conscientiousness to be positively associated with wages, while agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism were negatively associated with wages. In the United States, by contrast, no negative correlation between extraversion and wages has been found. Also, the magnitudes found for agreeableness and conscientiousness in this study were higher for women than for men (i.e. there was a higher negative penalty for greater agreeableness in women, as well as a higher positive reward for greater conscientiousness).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McLean|first1=Dawson|last2=Bouaissa|first2=Mohsen|last3=Rainville|first3=Bruno|last4=Auger|first4=Ludovic|date=2019-12-04|title=Non-Cognitive Skills: How Much Do They Matter for Earnings in Canada?|url=https://articlegateway.com/index.php/AJM/article/view/2392|journal=American Journal of Management|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|doi=10.33423/ajm.v19i4.2392|issn=2165-7998|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Research designed to investigate the individual effects of Big Five personality traits on work performance via worker completed surveys and supervisor ratings of work performance has implicated individual traits in several different work roles performances. A "work role" is defined as the responsibilities an individual has while they are working. Nine work roles have been identified, which can be classified in three broader categories: proficiency (the ability of a worker to effectively perform their work duties), adaptivity (a workers ability to change working strategies in response to changing work environments), and proactivity (extent to which a worker will spontaneously put forth effort to change the work environment). These three categories of behavior can then be directed towards three different levels: either the individual, team, or organizational level leading to the nine different work role performance possibilities.<ref name=Neal>{{cite journal | vauthors = Neal A, Yeo G, Koy A, Xiao T |title=Predicting the Form and Direction of Work Role Performance From the Big 5 Model of Personality Traits|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|date=26 January 2011|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–92 |doi=10.1002/job.742}}</ref>

*[[Openness to experience|Openness]] is positively related to proactivity at the individual and the organizational levels and is negatively related to team and organizational proficiency. These effects were found to be completely independent of one another. This is also counter-conscientious and has a negative correlation to Conscientiousness. <ref>Judge & LePine, “Bright and Dark Sides…” Research Companion to the Dysfunctional
Workplace, 2007</ref>
*[[Agreeableness]] is negatively related to individual task proactivity. Typically this is associated with lower career success and less able to cope with conflict. <ref>Judge & LePine, “Bright and Dark Sides…” Research Companion to the Dysfunctional
Workplace, 2007</ref>
*[[Extraversion]] is negatively related to individual task proficiency. Extraversion has a higher job and life satifaction but more impulsive behaviors. <ref>Judge & LePine, “Bright and Dark Sides…” Research Companion to the Dysfunctional
Workplace, 2007</ref>
*[[Conscientiousness]] is positively related to all forms of work role performance. This has a higher leadership effectiveness and lower deviance behaviors but also lower learning in skill acquisition.<ref>Judge & LePine, “Bright and Dark Sides…” Research Companion to the Dysfunctional
Workplace, 2007</ref>
*[[Neuroticism]] is negatively related to all forms of work role performance. This has a trend to engage in more risky behaviors <ref>Judge & LePine, “Bright and Dark Sides…” Research Companion to the Dysfunctional
Workplace, 2007</ref><ref name=Neal />

Two theories have been integrated in an attempt to account for these differences in work role performance. [[Trait activation theory]] posits that within a person trait levels predict future behavior, that trait levels differ between people, and that work-related cues activate traits which leads to [[Counterproductive work behavior|work relevant behaviors]]. Role theory suggests that role senders provide cues to elicit desired behaviors. In this context, role senders (i.e.: supervisors, managers, et cetera) provide workers with cues for expected behaviors, which in turn activates personality traits and work relevant behaviors. In essence, expectations of the role sender lead to different behavioral outcomes depending on the trait levels of individual workers and because people differ in trait levels, responses to these cues will not be universal.<ref name=Neal />

=== Romantic relationships ===

The Big Five model of personality was used for attempts to predict satisfaction in romantic relationships, relationship quality in dating, engaged, and married couples.<ref name=Holland>{{cite journal | first1 = Ashley S. | last1 = Holland | first2 = Glenn I. | last2 = Roisman | name-list-style = vanc |title=Big five personality traits and relationship quality: Self-reported, observational, and physiological evidence|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=October 2008|volume=25|issue=5|pages=811–29 |url=http://www.news.illinois.edu/WebsandThumbs/Roisman,Glen/Roisman_Personality_Relationships.pdf |access-date=12 April 2012|doi=10.1177/0265407508096697 | s2cid = 28388979 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130302155319/http://news.illinois.edu/WebsandThumbs/Roisman,Glen/Roisman_Personality_Relationships.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

''Dating couples''
*Self-reported relationship quality is negatively related to partner-reported [[neuroticism]] and positively related to both self- and partner-reported [[conscientiousness]]<ref name=Holland />

''Engaged couples''
*Self-reported relationship quality was higher among those high in partner-reported openness, agreeableness and [[conscientiousness]].
*Self-reported relationship quality was higher among those high in self-reported [[extraversion]] and agreeableness.
*Self-reported relationship quality is negatively related to both self- and partner-reported [[neuroticism]]
*Observers rated the relationship quality higher if the participating partner's self-reported extraversion was high<ref name=Holland />

''Married couples''
*High self-reported [[neuroticism]], [[extraversion]], and [[agreeableness]] are related to high levels of self-reported relationship quality
*Partner-reported agreeableness is related to observed relationship quality.<ref name=Holland />

These reports are, however, rare and not conclusive.

=== Political identification ===

The Big Five Personality Model also has applications in the study of political psychology. Studies have been finding links between the big five personality traits and political identification. It has been found by several studies that individuals who score high in Conscientiousness are more likely to possess a [[Right-wing_politics|right-wing political identification]].<ref name=":13">Gerber, Alan S., et al.

=== Scope of predictive power ===

The predictive effects of the Big Five personality traits relate mostly to social functioning and rules-driven behavior and are not very specific for prediction of particular aspects of behavior. For example, it was noted that high neuroticism precedes the development of all common mental disorders<ref name="NeuroticismMA"/> and is not attributed with personality by all temperament researchers.<ref name = PTRS-B/> Further evidence is required to fully uncover the nature and differences between personality traits, temperament and life outcomes. Social and contextual parameters also play a role in outcomes and the interaction between the two is not yet fully understood.<ref>Roberts, p. 338</ref>

=== Religiosity ===

Though the effect sizes are small: Of the Big Five personality traits high Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Extraversion relate to general religiosity, while Openness relate negatively to [[fundamentalism|religious fundamentalism]] and positively to [[spirituality]]. High Neuroticism may be related to extrinsic religiosity, whereas intrinsic religiosity and spirituality reflect Emotional Stability.<ref name=Saroglou>{{cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion and the five-factors of personality: A meta-analytic review.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=32|year=2002|pages=15–25|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00233-6}}</ref>

Several measures of the Big Five exist:

The most frequently used measures of the Big Five comprise either items that are self-descriptive sentences<ref name="De_Fruyt_2004" /> or, in the case of lexical measures, items that are single adjectives.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Due to the length of sentence-based and some lexical measures, short forms have been developed and validated for use in applied research settings where questionnaire space and respondent time are limited, such as the 40-item balanced ''International English Big-Five Mini-Markers''<ref name="Thompson" /> or a very brief (10 item) measure of the Big Five domains.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-6566(03)00046-1 |first1=Samuel D |last1=Gosling |first2=Peter J |last2=Rentfrow |first3=William B |last3=Swann | name-list-style = vanc |year=2003 |title=A very brief measure of the Big-Five personality domains |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=504–28|citeseerx=10.1.1.1013.6925 }}</ref> Research has suggested that some methodologies in administering personality tests are inadequate in length and provide insufficient detail to truly evaluate personality.

Much of the evidence on the measures of the Big 5 relies on self-report questionnaires, which makes self-report bias and falsification of responses difficult to deal with and account for.<ref name="Stewart I.D.,&Elisa J. G., 2002" /> It has been argued that the Big Five tests do not create an accurate personality profile because the responses given on these tests are not true in all cases and can be falsified.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Lynn A.|last2=Ryan|first2=Ann Marie|date=2000|title=Variance in faking across noncognitive measures.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.85.5.812|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=85|issue=5|pages=812–21|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.85.5.812|pmid=11055152|issn=1939-1854}}</ref> For example, questionnaires are answered by potential employees who might choose answers that paint them in the best light.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/big-five-personality-tests.html|title=Big Five Personality Tests, traits and background|work=Personality and Aptitude Career Tests|access-date=2017-07-01}}</ref>

Research suggests that a relative-scored Big Five measure in which respondents had to make repeated choices between equally desirable personality descriptors may be a potential alternative to traditional Big Five measures in accurately assessing personality traits, especially when lying or biased responding is present.<ref name="Hirsh, J. B. 2008" /> When compared with a traditional Big Five measure for its ability to predict GPA and creative achievement under both normal and "fake good"-bias response conditions, the relative-scored measure significantly and consistently predicted these outcomes under both conditions; however, the Likert questionnaire lost its predictive ability in the faking condition. Thus, the relative-scored measure proved to be less affected by biased responding than the Likert measure of the Big Five.

Schwartz analyzed 700 million words, phrases, and topic instances collected from the Facebook messages of 75,000 volunteers, who also took standard personality tests, and found striking variations in language with personality, gender, and age.<ref name="Schwartz, Andrew H 2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz HA, Eichstaedt JC, Kern ML, Dziurzynski L, Ramones SM, Agrawal M, Shah A, Kosinski M, Stillwell D, Seligman ME, Ungar LH | title = Personality, gender, and age in the language of social media: the open-vocabulary approach | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = e73791 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24086296 | pmc = 3783449 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0073791 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...873791S | doi-access = free }}</ref>

It has been argued that there are limitations to the scope of the Big Five model as an explanatory or predictive theory.<ref name="Boyle_1995"/><ref name="Boyle, G.J. (2008)."/> It has also been argued that measures of the Big Five account for only 56% of the normal personality trait sphere alone (not even considering the abnormal personality trait sphere).<ref name="Boyle_1995"/> Also, the static Big Five<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cattell RB, Boyle GJ, Chant D | year = 2002 | title = The enriched behavioral prediction equation and its impact on structured learning and the dynamic calculus | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 109 | issue = 1 | pages = 202–05 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.109.1.202 | pmid = 11863038 | url = http://epublications.bond.edu.au/hss_pubs/42 | type = Submitted manuscript | access-date = 2018-10-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150123214003/http://epublications.bond.edu.au/hss_pubs/42/ | archive-date = 2015-01-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref> is not theory driven, it is merely a statistically driven investigation of certain descriptors that tend to cluster together often based on less-than-optimal factor analytic procedures.<ref name = "Boyle_1995" />{{rp|431–33}}<ref name=PTRS-B /> Measures of the Big Five constructs appear to show some consistency in interviews, self-descriptions and observations, and this static five-factor structure seems to be found across a wide range of participants of different ages and cultures.<ref>{{cite book| first1 = Daniel L | last1 = Schacter| first2 = Daniel Todd | last2 = Gilbert | first3 = Daniel M | last3 = Wegner | name-list-style = vanc |title=Psychology| url = https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha | url-access = registration |edition= 2nd|year=2011|publisher=Worth|pages=[https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha/page/474 474–75] | isbn = 978-1-4292-3719-2 }}</ref> However, while [[Genotypic sex determination|genotypic]] temperament trait dimensions might appear across different cultures, the [[Phenotypic trait|phenotypic]] expression of personality traits differs profoundly across different cultures as a function of the different socio-cultural conditioning and experiential learning that takes place within different cultural settings.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Piekkola B | year = 2011 | title = Traits across cultures: A neo-Allportian perspective | journal = Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology | volume = 31 | pages = 2–24 | doi=10.1037/a0022478}}</ref>

Moreover, the fact that the Big Five model was based on [[lexical hypothesis]] (i.e. on the verbal descriptors of individual differences) indicated strong methodological flaws in this model, especially related to its main factors, Extraversion and Neuroticism. First, there is a natural pro-social bias of language in people's verbal evaluations. After all, language is an invention of group dynamics that was developed to facilitate socialization and the exchange of information and to synchronize group activity. This social function of language therefore creates a sociability bias in verbal descriptors of human behavior: there are more words related to social than physical or even mental aspects of behavior. The sheer number of such descriptors will cause them to group into the largest factor in any language, and such grouping has nothing to do with the way that core systems of individual differences are set up. Second, there is also a negativity bias in emotionality (i.e. most emotions have negative affectivity), and there are more words in language to describe negative rather than positive emotions. Such asymmetry in emotional valence creates another bias in language. Experiments using the lexical hypothesis approach indeed demonstrated that the use of lexical material skews the resulting dimensionality according to a sociability bias of language and a negativity bias of emotionality, grouping all evaluations around these two dimensions.<ref name=Plos/> This means that the two largest dimensions in the Big Five model might be just an artifact of the lexical approach that this model employed.

===Limited scope===
One common criticism is that the Big Five does not explain all of human personality. Some psychologists have dissented from the model precisely because they feel it neglects other domains of personality, such as [[religiosity]], [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|manipulativeness/machiavellianism]], [[honesty]], sexiness/[[seduction|seductiveness]], [[consumption (economics)|thriftiness]], [[wikt:conservativeness|conservativeness]], [[gender role|masculinity/femininity]], [[snob]]bishness/[[egotism]], [[humour|sense of humour]], and [[sensation seeking|risk-taking/thrill-seeking]].<ref name=Paunonen>{{Cite journal | first1 = Sampo V | last1 = Paunonen | last2 = Jackson | first2 = Douglas N | name-list-style = vanc | year = 2000 | title = What Is Beyond the Big Five?

McAdams]] has called the Big Five a "psychology of the stranger", because they refer to traits that are relatively easy to observe in a stranger; other aspects of personality that are more privately held or more context-dependent are excluded from the Big Five.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1995.tb00500.x | vauthors = McAdams DP | year = 1995 | title = What do we know when we know a person? | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 365–96 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.527.6832 }}</ref>

There may be debate as to what counts as personality and what does not and the nature of the questions in the survey greatly influence outcome. Multiple particularly broad question databases have failed to produce the Big Five as the top five traits.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Saucier|first1=Gerard|title=What makes a good structural model of personality? Evaluating the big five and alternatives.|date=2015|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/14343-013|work=APA handbook of personality and social psychology, Volume 4: Personality processes and individual differences.|pages=283–305|place=Washington|publisher=American Psychological Association|doi=10.1037/14343-013|isbn=978-1-4338-1704-5|access-date=2021-01-03|last2=Srivastava|first2=Sanjay}}</ref>

In many studies, the five factors are not fully [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to one another; that is, the five factors are not independent.<ref name=Musek>{{cite journal| last =  Musek | first = Janet | name-list-style = vanc |title= A general factor of personality: Evidence for the Big One in the five-factor model|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year = 2007|volume=41| issue = 6 |pages=1213–33|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2007.02.003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Van der Linden D, te Nijenhuis J, Bakker AB |year=2010|title=The General Factor of Personality: A meta-analysis of Big Five intercorrelations and a criterion-related validity study|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=44|issue=3|pages=315–27|url=http://www.beanmanaged.eu/pdf/articles/arnoldbakker/article_arnold_bakker_218.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2010.03.003|access-date=2012-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711004026/http://www.beanmanaged.eu/pdf/articles/arnoldbakker/article_arnold_bakker_218.pdf|archive-date=2012-07-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> Orthogonality is viewed as desirable by some researchers because it minimizes redundancy between the dimensions. This is particularly important when the goal of a study is to provide a comprehensive description of personality with as few variables as possible.

===Methodological issues===
[[Factor analysis]], the statistical method used to identify the dimensional structure of observed variables, lacks a universally recognized basis for choosing among solutions with different numbers of factors.<ref name=notbasic>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Eysenck HJ |year=1992|title=Four ways five factors are not basic|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=13|issue=8|pages=667–73|url=http://web.sls.hw.ac.uk/teaching/level2/A42SO2/reading/Eysenck%20Four%20ways%20five%20factors%20are%20not%20basic.pdf|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(92)90237-j|access-date=2012-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107113908/http://web.sls.hw.ac.uk/teaching/level2/A42SO2/reading/Eysenck%20Four%20ways%20five%20factors%20are%20not%20basic.pdf|archive-date=2012-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> A five factor solution depends on some degree of interpretation by the analyst. A larger number of factors may underlie these five factors. This has led to disputes about the "true" number of factors. Big Five proponents have responded that although other solutions may be viable in a single dataset, only the five-factor structure consistently replicates across different studies.<ref name=reply>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Costa PT, McCrae RR |year=1992|title=Reply to Eysenck|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=13|issue=8|pages=861–65|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(92)90002-7}}</ref>

Surveys in studies are often online surveys of college students. Results do not always replicate when run on other populations or in other languages.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=APA PsycNet|url= |website=doi.apa.org|doi=10.1037/a0030841|pmc=4104167|pmid=23245291}}</ref>

Moreover, the factor analysis that this model is based on is a linear method incapable of capturing nonlinear, feedback and contingent relationships between core systems of individual differences.<ref name="Plos" />

===Theoretical status===
A frequent criticism is that the Big Five is not based on any underlying [[theory]]; it is merely an [[empirical evidence|empirical finding]] that certain descriptors cluster together under [[factor analysis]].<ref name=notbasic/> Although this does not mean that these five factors do not exist, the underlying causes behind them are unknown.

[[Jack Block]]'s final published work before his death in January 2010 drew together his lifetime perspective on the five-factor model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Block | first1 = Jack | name-list-style = vanc | year = 2010 | title = The five-factor framing of personality and beyond: Some ruminations | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 2–25 | doi=10.1080/10478401003596626| s2cid = 26355524 }}</ref>

He summarized his critique of the model in terms of:
* the atheoretical nature of the five-factors.
* their "cloudy" measurement.
* the model's inappropriateness for studying [[early childhood]].
* the use of factor analysis as the exclusive paradigm for conceptualizing personality.
* the continuing non-consensual understandings of the five-factors.
* the existence of unrecognized but successful efforts to specify aspects of character not subsumed by the five-factors.

He went on to suggest that repeatedly observed higher order factors hierarchically above the proclaimed Big Five personality traits may promise deeper biological understanding of the origins and implications of these superfactors.

===Evidence for six factors rather than five===

It has been noted that even though early [[lexical hypothesis|lexical]] studies in the English language indicated five large groups of personality traits, more recent, and more comprehensive, cross-language studies have provided evidence for six large groups rather than five.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashton MC, Lee K, Goldberg LR | title = A hierarchical analysis of 1,710 English personality-descriptive adjectives | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 5 | pages = 707–21 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15535781 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.5.707 }}</ref> These six groups form the basis of the [[HEXACO model of personality structure]]. Based on these findings it has been suggested that the Big Five system should be replaced by HEXACO, or revised to better align with lexical evidence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashton MC, Lee K, de Vries RE | title = The HEXACO Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, and Emotionality factors: a review of research and theory | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–52 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24577101 | doi = 10.1177/1088868314523838 | s2cid = 38312803 }}</ref>
