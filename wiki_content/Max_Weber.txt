'''Maximilian Karl Emil Weber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|eɪ|b|ər}};<ref>{{Cite Dictionary.com|Weber}} 2 of 2.</ref> {{IPA-de|ˈveːbɐ|lang}}; 21 April 1864{{snd}}14 June 1920) was a German [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[historian]], [[jurist]], and [[political economy|political economist]] who is regarded as among the most important theorists of the development of [[Modernity|modern]] [[Western world|Western society]]. His ideas profoundly influence [[social theory]] and [[social research|research]]. Despite being recognized as one of the fathers of sociology along with [[Auguste Comte]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Émile Durkheim]], Weber saw himself not as a sociologist but as a historian.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History and Social Theory|last=Burke|first=Peter|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8014-8100-7|page=11}}</ref><ref name="WPet"/>

Unlike [[Émile Durkheim]], Weber did not believe in [[wikt:monocausal|monocausal]] explanations, proposing instead that for any outcome there can be multiple causes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tiryakian|first=Edward A.|title=For Durkheim: Essays in Historical and Cultural Sociology|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7155-8|page=321}}</ref> He was a key proponent of methodological [[Antipositivism|anti-positivism]], arguing for the study of [[social action]] through [[Verstehen|interpretive]] (rather than purely [[Empiricism|empiricist]]) methods, based on understanding the purpose and [[Meaning-making|meanings]] that individuals attach to their own actions. Weber's main intellectual concern was in understanding the processes of [[Rationalisation (sociology)|rationalisation]], [[Secularization|secularisation]], and "[[disenchantment]]". He argued that such processes result from a new way of thinking about the world<ref>{{cite book|last=Macionis|first=John J.|title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-205-11671-3|edition=14th|location=Boston|page=88}}</ref> and are associated with the rise of [[capitalism]] and modernity.<ref name="Habermas, Jürgen 1990 p2" />

Weber is best known for his other thesis combining [[economic sociology]] and the [[sociology of religion]], emphasising the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism (in contrast to Marx's [[historical materialism]]).<ref group="lower-roman">Weber's (2002/1905) references to "Superstructure" and "base" are unambiguous references to Marxism's base/superstructure theory. (''Protestant Ethic'' 1905, pp. 19, 35).</ref> Weber would first elaborate his theory in his seminal work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), where he attributed [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Protestantism]] as one of the major "elective affinities" involved in the rise of [[Market economy|market-driven]] capitalism and the [[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]] [[Nation state|nation-state]] in the Western world.<ref name=":1" /> Arguing the boosting of capitalism as a basic tenet of Protestantism, Weber suggested that the spirit of capitalism is inherent in Protestant religious values.<ref name=":1">Weber, Max 2002 [1905]. ''The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism'', translated by S. Kalberg. Roxbury Publishing.</ref> ''Protestant Ethic'' would form the earliest part in Weber's broader investigations into world religion, as he later examined the [[The Religion of China|religions of China]] and [[The Religion of India|India]], as well as [[Ancient Judaism (book)|ancient Judaism]], with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of [[social stratification]]. In another major work, "[[Politics as a Vocation]]", Weber defined "the [[State (polity)|state]]" as an entity that successfully claims a "[[monopoly on violence|monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force]] within a given territory".<ref name=":4" /> He would also be the first to [[Tripartite classification of authority|categorise]] social authority into distinct forms: [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]], [[Traditional authority|traditional]], and [[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]]. Among these categories, Weber's analysis of [[bureaucracy]] emphasized that modern state institutions are increasingly based on the latter (rational-legal authority).

Weber also made a variety of other contributions in [[economic history]], [[Economics|theory]], and [[Economic methodology|methodology]]. His analysis of modernity and rationalisation would significantly influence the [[critical theory]] associated with the [[Frankfurt School]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Löwy|first=Michael|date=1996|title=Figures of Weberian Marxism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/658052|journal=Theory and Society|volume=25|issue=3|pages=431–446|doi=10.1007/BF00158264|jstor=658052|s2cid=147323256|issn=0304-2421|access-date=20 July 2021|archive-date=20 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210720024732/https://www.jstor.org/stable/658052|url-status=live}}</ref> After the [[First World War]], he was among the founders of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]]. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919. After contracting [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]], he died of [[pneumonia]] in 1920, aged 56.

==Personal life==
===Early life and background===

[[File:Max Weber and brothers 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|Max Weber (left) and his brothers, [[Alfred Weber|Alfred]] (center) and Karl, in 1879]]

Maximilian Karl Emil Weber was born on 21 April 1864 in [[Erfurt]], [[Province of Saxony]], [[Prussia]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> He would be the oldest of seven children to [[Max Weber Sr.]], a wealthy and prominent civil servant and [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] member, and his wife Helene Fallenstein, who partly descended from French [[Huguenots|Huguenot]] immigrants and held strong moral absolutist ideas.

Weber Sr.'s involvement in public life immersed his home in both politics and academia, as his [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] welcomed many prominent scholars and public figures.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> The young Weber and his brother [[Alfred Weber|Alfred]], who also became a sociologist and economist, thrived in this intellectual atmosphere. For Christmas in 1876 Weber, at thirteen years old, would gift his parents two historical essays, entitled "About the course of German history, with special reference to the positions of the Emperor and the Pope", and "About the Roman Imperial period from Constantine to the migration of nations".<ref>Sica, Alan (2004). ''Max Weber and the New Century''. London: [[Transaction Publishers]]. {{ISBN|0-7658-0190-6}}. p. 24.</ref>

In class, bored and unimpressed with teachers{{snd}}who, in turn, resented what they perceived as a disrespectful attitude{{snd}}Weber secretly read all forty volumes of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]],<ref name="Calhoun2002-165" /><ref name="Käsler1988" /> and it has been recently argued that this was an important influence on his thought and methodology.<ref>{{Citation|last=McKinnon|first=Andrew M.|title=Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism|url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=28|number=1|pages=108–26|year=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01367.x|hdl=2164/3035|s2cid=144579790|hdl-access=free|access-date=25 October 2014|archive-date=2 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402153442/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Before entering university, he would read many other classical works.<ref name="Käsler1988" /> Over time, Weber would also be significantly affected by the marital tension between his father, "a man who enjoyed earthly pleasures", and his mother, a devout [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] "who sought to lead an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] life".<ref name="Ritzer2009-32" /><ref name="LK" />

===Education===

In 1882, Weber enrolled in the [[University of Heidelberg]] as a law student,<ref name="Bendix1"/> transferring to the [[University of Berlin]] after a year of military service.<ref name="Calhoun2002-165" /> After his first few years as a student, during which he spent much time "drinking beer and [[Academic fencing|fencing]]", Weber would increasingly take his mother's side in family arguments and grew estranged from his father.<ref name="Ritzer2009-32" /><ref name="LK" /><ref name="AllanAllan2005-146" /> Simultaneously with his studies, he worked as a junior lawyer.<ref name="Calhoun2002-165" /> In 1886, Weber passed the examination for [[Referendary|Referendar]], comparable to the [[bar association]] examination in the British and U.S. legal systems. Throughout the late 1880s, Weber continued his study of law and history,<ref name="Calhoun2002-165" /> earning his law doctorate in 1889 by writing a [[Thesis|dissertation]] on legal history titled ''[[The history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages]]''. This work would be used as part of a longer work, ''On the History of Trading Companies in the Middle Ages, based on South-European Sources'', published in the same year.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|ix}} Two years later, working with [[August Meitzen]], Weber completed his [[Habilitation#Germany|habilitation]], ''[[Roman Agrarian History and its Significance for Public and Private Law (book)|Roman Agrarian History and its Significance for Public and Private Law]]''.<ref name=diss/><ref name="Bendix2"/> Having thus become a ''[[privatdozent]]'', Weber joined the University of Berlin's faculty, lecturing and consulting for the government.<ref name="Lachmann1970"/>

===Marriage===

[[File:Max and Marianne Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|upright|Max Weber and his wife Marianne (1894)]]

In 1893, Weber married his distant cousin [[Marianne Weber|Marianne Schnitger]], later a [[Feminist movement|feminist activist]] and author in her own right,<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /><ref name="Marianne" /> who was instrumental in collecting and publishing Weber's journal articles as books after his death, while her biography of him is an important source for understanding Weber's life.<ref name="LehmannRoth1995"/><ref name="HonigsheimSica2003"/> They would have no children.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-146"/> The marriage granted long-awaited financial independence to Weber, allowing him to finally leave his parents' household.<ref name=LK/>

==Career and later life==
===Early work<!--Weber Circle redirects here-->===

In the years between the completion of his dissertation and habilitation, Weber took an interest in contemporary [[social policy]]. In 1888, he joined the ''[[Verein für Socialpolitik]]'',<ref name="WaSI" /> a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the [[Historical school of economics|historical school]], who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues. He also involved himself in politics, joining the left-leaning [[Evangelical Social Congress]].<ref name="Max Weber and German Politics, 1890–1920" /> In 1890, the Verein established a research program to examine "[[Polish question|the Polish question]]", or ''[[ostflucht]]'': the influx of Polish farm workers into [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern Germany]] as local labourers migrated to Germany's rapidly [[industrialization|industrialising]] cities.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote a large part of the final report,<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /><ref name="WaSI" /> which generated considerable attention and controversy, marking the beginning of Weber's renown as a social scientist.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" />

From 1893 to 1899, Weber was a member of the ''[[Pan-German League|Alldeutscher Verband]]'' (Pan-German League), an organization that campaigned against the influx of the Polish workers; the degree of Weber's support for the [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanisation of Poles]] and similar nationalist policies is still debated by modern scholars.<ref name="MommsenSteinberg1990" /><ref name="Hobsbawm1987" /> In some of his work, in particular his provocative lecture on "The Nation State and Economic Policy" delivered in 1895, Weber criticises the immigration of Poles and blames the [[Junker (Prussia)|Junker]] class for perpetuating Slavic immigration to serve their selfish interests.<ref name=":2">Weber, Max. 1994 [1895].

Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press|University of Cambridge Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-521-39719-3}}.</ref>{{Rp|1–28}}

Weber and his wife, [[Marianne Weber|Marianne]], moved to [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] in 1894, where Weber was appointed professor of economics at the [[University of Freiburg|Albert-Ludwigs University]],<ref name="Bendix2" /><ref name="Lachmann1970" /> before accepting the same position at the [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]] in 1896.<ref name="Bendix2" /><ref name="Lachmann1970" /> There, Weber became a central figure in the so-called "'''Weber Circle'''"<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, composed of other intellectuals, including his wife Marianne, as well as [[Georg Jellinek]], [[Ernst Troeltsch]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Robert Michels]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Weber also remained active in the Verein and the Evangelical Social Congress.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> His research in that period was focused on economics and legal history.<ref name="Calhoun2002-166" />

===Mental health concerns===

In 1897, Weber Sr. died two months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /><ref name="EESoc-7" /> After this, Weber became increasingly prone to depression, nervousness and [[insomnia]], making it difficult for him to fulfill his duties as a professor.<ref name="Calhoun2002-165" /><ref name="Bendix2" /> His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending the summer and fall months of 1900 in a [[sanatorium]], Weber and his wife travelled to Italy at the end of the year, not returning to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and would not return until 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal [[chronology]] that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne feared that Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /><ref name="newyorker">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/11/29/041129crbo_books|title=Why Work?|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=25 September 2014|date=22 November 2004|archive-date=18 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718191407/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/11/29/041129crbo_books|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Later work===

After Weber's immense productivity in the early 1890s, he did not publish any papers between early 1898 and late 1902, finally resigning his professorship in late 1903. Freed from those obligations, in that year he accepted a position as associate editor of the ''[[Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik|Archives for Social Science and Social Welfare]]'',<ref name="Bendix3"/> where he worked with his colleagues {{Interlanguage link multi|Edgar Jaffé|de}} and [[Werner Sombart]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/><ref name="GRMW"/> His new interests would lie in more fundamental issues of social sciences; his works from this latter period are of primary interest to modern scholars.<ref name="Calhoun2002-166"/> In 1904, Weber began to publish some of his most seminal papers in this journal, notably his essay ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', which became his most famous work<ref name="EESoc-22"/> and laid the foundations for his later research on the impact of cultures and religions on the development of economic systems.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Iannaccone |first=Laurence |year=1998 |title=Introduction to the Economics of Religion |journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=1465–96 |jstor=2564806 }}</ref> This essay was the only one of his works from that period that was published as a book during his lifetime. Some other of his works written in the first one and a half decades of the 20th century{{snd}}published posthumously and dedicated primarily from the fields of sociology of religion, economic and legal sociology{{snd}}are also recognised as among his most important intellectual contributions.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>

Also in 1904, Weber visited the United States, participating in the Congress of Arts and Sciences held in connection with the [[World's fair]] ([[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]) in [[St. Louis]]. A monument to his visit was placed at the home of relatives whom Weber visited in [[Mount Airy, North Carolina|Mt. Airy]], [[North Carolina]].<ref>Wise, Michael. 2006. "Max Weber Visits America: A Review of the Video". ''Sociation Today'' 4(2).</ref>

Despite his partial recovery evident in America, Weber felt that he was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907.<ref name="Lachmann1970"/><ref name="Bendix3"/> In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the [[German Sociological Association]] ({{Lang-de|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie|label=none}}, or ''DGS'') and served as its first treasurer, though resigning in 1912.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>

===Political involvements===

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Max Weber (middle, facing right) in 1917 with [[Ernst Toller]] (middle, facing camera)]]

Later in 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine [[social-democrats]] and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] revolutionary ideals.<ref name="TPaSToMW" />

====World War I====

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], Weber, aged 50, volunteered for service and was appointed as a [[Military reserve force|reserve officer]] in charge of organizing the army hospitals in Heidelberg, a role he fulfilled until the end of 1915.<ref name="Bendix3" /><ref name="Kaesler" /> Weber's views on the war and the expansion of the [[German colonial empire|German empire]] changed during the course of the conflict.<ref name="TPaSToMW" /><ref name="Kaesler" /><ref name=":3">{{Interlanguage link|Hans H. Gerth|lt=Gerth, Hans H.|es|Hans Gerth}}, and [[C. Wright Mills]]. 1948.

London: [[Routledge]]. {{ISBN|978-0-415-17503-6}}.</ref> Early on, he supported [[Lebensraum#First World War nationalist premise|nationalist rhetoric]] and the war effort, though with some hesitation, viewing the war as a necessity to fulfill German duty as a leading state power. In time, however, Weber became one of the most prominent critics of German [[expansionism]] and of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor#World War I|Kaiser's war policies]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Weber publicly attacked the [[Schlieffen Plan|Belgian annexation policy]] and [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], later supporting calls for constitutional reform, democratisation, and [[universal suffrage]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" />

====Post-World War I====

Weber joined the [[Workers' council|worker and soldier council]] of Heidelberg in 1918. He then served in the German delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919–1920|Paris Peace Conference]] and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the [[Weimar Constitution]].<ref name="Bendix3" /> Motivated by his understanding of the [[Politics of the United States|American model]], he advocated a strong, [[Direct election|popularly elected]] presidency as a constitutional counterbalance to the power of the professional [[bureaucracy]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers that became [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the Weimar Constitution. These provisions were later used by [[Adolf Hitler]] to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.<ref>Eliaeson, Sven. 2000.

Weber would also run, though unsuccessfully, for a parliamentary seat, as a member of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]], which he had co-founded.<ref name="SchieVoermann2006" /> He opposed both the leftist [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] and the ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], principled positions that defied the political alignments in Germany at that time,<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> and which may have prevented [[Friedrich Ebert]], the new [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|social-democratic]] President of Germany, from appointing Weber as minister or ambassador.<ref name="Kaesler" /> Weber commanded widespread respect but relatively little influence.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> [[Max Weber and German politics|Weber's role in German politics]] remains controversial to this day.



In Weber's critique of the left, he complained of the leaders of the leftist [[Spartacus League]], led by [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], that controlled the city government of [[Berlin]] while Weber was campaigning for his party:<ref>{{Citation|last=Radkau|first=Joachim|title=Max Weber, A Biography|page=209|year=2009|place=New York|publisher=Polity Press|author-link=Joachim Radkau}}</ref><blockquote>We have this [German] revolution to thank for the fact that we cannot send a single division against the Poles. All we see is dirt, muck, dung, and horse-play{{snd}}nothing else. Liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and Rosa Luxemburg in the zoological gardens.</blockquote>

Weber was, at the same time, critical of the [[Versailles Treaty]], which he believed unjustly assigned "[[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|war guilt]]" to Germany when it came to the war, as Weber believed that many countries were guilty of starting it, not just Germany. In making this case, Weber argued:<ref name=":4">Weber, as translated in:

Later that same month, in January 1919, after Weber and his party were defeated for election, Weber delivered one of his greatest academic lectures, "[[Politics as a Vocation]]", which reflected on the inherent violence and dishonesty he saw among politicians{{snd}}a profession in which only recently Weber was so personally active. About the nature of politicians, he concluded that, "in nine out of ten cases they are windbags puffed up with hot air about themselves. They are not in touch with reality, and they do not feel the burden they need to shoulder; they just intoxicate themselves with romantic sensations."<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|21,196}}

===Last years===

[[File:Max weber.JPG|thumb|Weber's grave in Heidelberg]]

Frustrated with politics, Weber resumed teaching during this time, first at the [[University of Vienna]], then, after 1919, at the [[University of Munich]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /><ref name="Lachmann1970" /><ref name="Bendix3" /> His lectures from that period were collected into major works, such as the ''[[Wirtschaftsgeschichte|General Economic History]]'', ''[[Science as a Vocation]]'', and ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]''.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> In Munich, he headed the first German university institute of sociology, but never held a professorial position in the discipline. Many colleagues and students in Munich attacked his response to the German Revolution, while some right-wing students held protests in front of his home.<ref name="TPaSToMW" />

On 14 June 1920, Max Weber contracted the [[Spanish flu]] and died of [[pneumonia]] in Munich.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> At the time of his death, Weber had not finished writing his {{Wikt-lang|en|magnum opus|i=no}} on sociological theory: ''[[Economy and Society]]''. His widow, Marianne, helped prepare it for its publication in 1921–1922.

==Methodology==

Sociology, for Max Weber, is "a science which attempts the interpretive understanding of social action in order thereby to arrive at a causal explanation of its course and effects".<ref name="Denhardt2010" />

Made clear in his methodology, Weber distinguished himself from [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], and other classical figures, in that (a) his primary focus would be on individuals and culture;<ref name="Calhoun2002-165" /> and (b) unlike theorists such as [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] and Durkheim, he did not (consciously) attempt to create any specific set of rules governing sociology or the social sciences in general.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on [[Individualism|the individual]] and their actions (i.e. [[Structure and agency|structure and action]]). Compared to Marx, who argued for the primacy of the material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.<ref name="Calhoun2002-165" /><ref name="AllanAllan2005-144" /><ref name="AllanAllan2005-148" />

===''Verstehen''===

Weber would primarily be concerned with the question of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[subjectivity]],<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> going on to distinguish [[social action]] from [[social behavior]], noting that social action must be understood through how individuals ''subjectively'' relate to one another.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /><ref name="Ritzer2009-31" /> Study of social action through interpretive means or {{Lang-de|[[verstehen]]|label=none}} ("to understand") must be based upon understanding the [[Meaning-making|subjective meaning]] and purpose that individuals attach to their actions.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /><ref name="Calhoun2002-166" /> Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist).<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in [[natural sciences]] and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" />

Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science as one definitely worth striving for, though he noted that it is ultimately an unreachable goal:<ref>Weber, Marx. 1999 [1904]. "[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/weber.htm#s2 'Objectivity' in Social Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016072006/https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/weber.htm#s2 |date=16 October 2020 }}".

The principle of ''[[methodological individualism]]'', which holds that social scientists should seek to understand collectivities (e.g. nations, cultures, governments, churches, corporations, etc.) solely as the result and the context of the actions of individual persons, can be traced to Weber, particularly to the first chapter of ''[[Economy and Society]]'', in which he argues that only individuals "can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action".<ref name="StanfordIndividualism" /><ref name="Ritzer2009-31" /> In other words, Weber contended that social phenomena can be understood scientifically only to the extent that they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals{{snd}}models that Weber called "[[ideal type]]s"{{snd}}from which actual historical events necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors.<ref name="StanfordIndividualism" /> The analytical constructs of an ideal type never exist in reality, but provide objective benchmarks against which real-life constructs can be measured:<ref name="AllanAllan2005-149" /><ref>Weber, Max. 1978 [1909].

Weber's methodology was developed in the context of a wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' ("method dispute").<ref name="Calhoun2002-166" /> Weber's position was close to [[historicism]], as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors).<ref name="Calhoun2002-166" /> Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of [[comparative history|comparative historical analysis]].<ref name="AllanAllan2005-153" /> As such, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-148" />

==Theories==
===Bureaucratic model (rational-legal model)===

Max Weber's theory of [[bureaucracy]], also known as the "[[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]]" model, attempts to explain bureaucracy from a [[Rationalism|rational]] point of view.<ref name="Ibrahim, 2012">Chun Hai, Jeong, and Nor Fadzlina Nawi (2012). ''Principles of Public Administration: Malaysian Perspectives''. Kuala Lumpur, MY: [[Pearson Education|Pearson Publishers]]. {{ISBN|978-967-349-233-6}}.</ref> Firstly, Weber argued that bureaucracy is "based on the general principle of precisely defined and organized across-the-board competencies of the various offices" which are "underpinned by rules, laws, or administrative regulations."<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|76}}

In particular, Weber notes three aspects that "constitute the essence of bureaucratic administration" in the [[public sector]], and "the essence of a bureaucratic management of a private company" in the [[private sector]]:<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|76–77}}

* A rigid division of labor is established that clearly identifies regular tasks and duties of the particular bureaucratic system.
* Regulations describe firmly established chains of command and the duties and capacity to coerce others to comply.
* Hiring people with particular, certified qualifications supports regular and continuous execution of the assigned duties.

In this sense, Weber would explain bureaucracy through nine main characteristics/principles:

# Specialized roles
# Recruitment based on merit (e.g. tested through open competition)
# Uniform principles of placement, promotion, and transfer in an administrative system
# Careerism with systematic salary structure
# Hierarchy, responsibility and accountability
# Subjection of official conduct to strict rules of discipline and control
# Supremacy of abstract rules
# Impersonal authority (e.g. office bearer does not bring the office with them)
# Political neutrality

====Benefits of bureaucracy====

As Weber noted, real bureaucracy is less optimal and effective than his ideal-type model. Each of Weber's principles can degenerate, especially when used to analyze individual levels in an organization. However, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic Model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules, and discipline.<ref name="James W. Fesler, 1965">[[James W. Fesler|Fesler, James W]]. 1965. "Bureaucratic Phenomena". ''[[Administrative Science Quarterly]]'' 10:163.</ref>

====Weaknesses of bureaucracy====

Competencies, efficiency and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially when dealing with oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy{{snd}}inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output{{snd}}tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes feel that they are not part of the organization's work vision and mission. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.<ref name="Ibrahim, 2012" />

===Rationalisation===

Many scholars have described [[Rationalization (sociology)|''rationalisation'']] and the question of [[Individualism|individual freedom]] in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/><ref name="Calhoun2002-167"/><ref name="Ritzer2009-30"/><ref name="AllanAllan2005-151"/> This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between [[psychological]] motivations, cultural values and beliefs (primarily religion), and the structure of the society (usually determined by the economy).<ref name="AllanAllan2005-148"/>

Weber understood rationalisation, first, as the individual cost-benefit calculation; second, as the wider bureaucratic organisation of the organisations; and finally, in the more general sense, as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic (i.e. ''[[disenchantment]]'').<ref name="AllanAllan2005-151"/><blockquote>The fate of our times is characterised by rationalisation and intellectualisation and, above all, by the "disenchantment of the world".<ref name="Koshul2005" /></blockquote>

Weber began his studies of the subject in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic [[List of the largest Protestant denominations|Protestant denominations]], particularly [[Calvinism]], shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain.<ref name="Bendix60" /><ref name="AllanAllan2005-162" /> In the Protestant religion, [[piety]] towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of [[calling (religious)|''calling'']]).<ref name="AllanAllan2005-162" /> The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.<ref name="Andrew J. Weigert" />

Weber continued his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on [[bureaucracy]] and on the classification of legitimate [[authority]] into three types{{snd}}[[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]], [[Traditional authority|traditional]] and [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]]{{snd}}of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> In these works Weber described what he saw as society's movement towards rationalisation.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart from the rest of the world.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation:<ref name="Habermas, Jürgen 1990 p2" />
{{quote|What Weber depicted was not only the secularisation of Western ''culture'', but also and especially the development of modern ''societies'' from the viewpoint of rationalisation. The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organisational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalisation of purposive-rational economic and administrative action. To the degree that everyday life was affected by this cultural and societal rationalisation, traditional forms of life{{snd}}which in the early modern period were differentiated primarily according to one's trade{{snd}}were dissolved.|[[Jürgen Habermas]]|''Modernity's Consciousness of Time'' (1985)|source=}}

Features of rationalisation include increasing knowledge, growing impersonality and enhanced control of social and material life.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Weber was ambivalent towards rationalisation; while admitting it was responsible for many advances, in particular, freeing humans from traditional, restrictive and illogical social guidelines, he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as "cogs in the machine" and curtailing their freedom, trapping them in the bureaucratic [[iron cage]] of rationality and bureaucracy.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /><ref name="Calhoun2002-167" /><ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42" /><ref name="AllanAllan2005-177" /> Related to rationalisation is the process of [[disenchantment]], in which the world is becoming more explained and less mystical, moving from [[polytheistic]] religions to [[monotheistic]] ones and finally to the Godless science of [[modernity]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> However, another interpretation of Weber's theory of disenchantment, advanced by [[historian of religion]] [[Jason Josephson-Storm]], claims that Weber does not envision a binary between rationalisation and magical thinking, and that Weber actually referred to the sequestering and professionalisation of magic when he described disenchantment, not to the disappearances of magic.<ref name="Josephson-Storm">{{Cite book|last=Josephson-Storm|first=Jason|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ|title=The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences|date=2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-40336-6|location=Chicago|access-date=19 June 2018|archive-date=10 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610203447/https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>{{rp|299–300}} Regardless, for Weber the processes of rationalisation affect all of society, removing "[[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] values{{nbs}}... from public life" and making art less creative.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-151-152" />

In a [[dystopian]] critique of rationalisation, Weber notes that modern society is a product of an [[individualistic]] drive of the [[Reformation]], yet at the same time, the society created in this process is less and less welcoming of individualism:<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> "How is it at all possible to salvage any remnants of 'individual' freedom of movement in any sense given this all-powerful trend?"<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" />

===Sociology of religion===

Weber's work in the field of [[sociology of religion]] began with the essay ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and continued with his analyses in ''[[The Religion of China]]'', ''[[The Religion of India]]'', and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]''. His work on other religions, however, would be interrupted by his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following ''Ancient Judaism'' with studies of early Christianity and Islam.<ref name="Bendix285"/> The three main themes within the essays were: the effect of religious ideas on economic activities; the relation between [[social stratification]] and religious ideas; and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation.<ref name="BendixChapter9"/>

Weber saw religion as one of the core forces in society.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-153"/> His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the [[Western world|Occident]] and the [[Orient]], although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].<ref name="BendixChapter9"/> He maintained that [[Calvinist]] (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had a major impact on the [[social innovation]] and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the [[rationalism]] of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise.<ref name="BendixChapter9"/> In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], or what he referred to as "[[disenchantment]] of the world".<ref name="BendixChapter9"/>

Weber also proposed a [[Sociocultural evolution|socio-evolutionary]] model of religious change, showing that in general, societies have moved from magic to [[polytheism]], then to [[pantheism]], [[monotheism]] and finally, [[ethical monotheism]].<ref name="AllanAllan2005-154"/> According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed [[professionalisation]] and the evolution of ever more sophisticated [[priesthood]].<ref name="AllanAllan2005-155"/> As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-158"/>

====''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''====

{{Main|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism}}
[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|upright|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]<!--[[wp:caption]] "Not every image ..."-->

''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' is Weber's most famous work.<ref name="EESoc-22"/> It has been argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the [[economic system|economic sphere]].<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37"/> In the essay, Weber puts forward the thesis that [[Calvinism|Calvinist ethic]] and ideas influenced the development of capitalism.<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37"/> He notes the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also notes that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|15–16}} Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant.<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37"/> Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]] elsewhere in the world:<ref name="AllanAllan2005-162" />
{{quote|The development of the concept of the calling quickly gave to the modern entrepreneur a fabulously clear conscience{{snd}}and also industrious workers; he gave to his employees as the wages of their ascetic devotion to the calling and of co-operation in his ruthless exploitation of them through capitalism the prospect of eternal salvation.|Max Weber|title=''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' (1905)|source=}}

Christian religious devotion had historically been accompanied by rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit.<ref name="Bendix57"/> Weber showed that certain types of Protestantism{{snd}}notably [[Calvinism]]{{snd}}were supportive of rational pursuit of economic gain and worldly activities dedicated to it, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance.<ref name="Bendix60"/> Weber argued that there were many reasons to look for the origins of modern capitalism in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].<ref name="Bendix54"/> In particular, the [[Protestant ethic]] (or more specifically, Calvinist ethic) motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures.<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37"/> The notion of [[Calling (religious)|calling]] meant that each individual had to take action as an indication of their salvation; just being a member of the Church was not enough.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-162"/> [[Predestination]] also reduced agonising over [[economic inequality]] and further, it meant that a material wealth could be taken as a sign of [[salvation]] in the afterlife.<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37"/><ref name="Ritzer2009-37-38"/> The believers therefore justified pursuit of profit with religion, as instead of being fuelled by morally suspect greed or ambition, their actions were motivated by a highly moral and respected philosophy.<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37"/> Weber would call this the "spirit of capitalism": it was the Protestant religious ideology that was behind{{snd}}and inevitably led to{{snd}}the capitalist economic system.<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37"/> This theory is often viewed as a reversal of Marx's thesis that the [[base and superstructure|economic "base"]] of society determines all other aspects of it.<ref name="Bendix60"/>

Weber abandoned research into Protestantism as his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional theologian, had begun work on the book ''Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: laying the groundwork for a comparative analysis of religion and society.<ref name="Bendix49"/>

The phrase "[[Protestant work ethic|work ethic]]" used in modern commentary is a derivative of the "[[Protestant ethic]]" discussed by Weber. It was adopted when the idea of the Protestant ethic was generalised to apply to the Japanese people, Jews and other non-Christians and thus lost its religious connotations.<ref name="SwedbergAgevall2005"/>

====''The Religion of China''====

{{Main|The Religion of China}}

''The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism'' was Weber's second major work on the sociology of religion. Hans H. Gerth edited and translated this text into English, with an introduction by C.{{nbs}}K. Wang.<ref>Weber, Max. 1968 [1915]. ''[[The Religion of China]]''. New York: Free Press. {{Google books|id=eTgvAAAAYAAJ|title=Lay summary}}</ref> Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with [[Puritanism#Beliefs|Puritanism]]. His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China.<ref name="Bendix98"/> He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese [[patrimonialism]] and [[officialdom]] and [[religion in China|Chinese religion]] and [[philosophy in China|philosophy]] (primarily, [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.<ref name="Bendix98"/>

According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational thought]], each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma.<ref name="Bendix135"/> Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth.<ref name="Bendix135"/> However, to both those qualities were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference.<ref name="Ritzer2009-37-38"/> Confucianism's goal was "a cultured status position", while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are "tools of God".<ref name="Bendix135"/> The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism.<ref name="Bendix135"/> Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian.<ref name="Ritzer2009-37-38"/> Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.<ref name="Bendix135"/>

====''The Religion of India''====

{{Main|The Religion of India}}

''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism'' was Weber's third major work on the sociology of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and the [[heterodox]] doctrines of [[Buddhism]], with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society.<ref name="Bendix142"/> In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism.<ref name="Ritzer2009-37-38"/> The [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste.<ref name="Ritzer2009-37-38"/> Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant in the context of the advancement of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].<ref name="Ritzer2009-37-38"/>

Weber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from [[The Religion of China|his previous work on China]] to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems.<ref name="Bendix199"/> He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherworldly [[mysticism|mystical]] experience.<ref name="Bendix199"/> The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a [[prophet]] or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on magic.<ref name="Bendix199"/> In Asia, there was no [[Messianic prophecy]] to give ''plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike''.<ref name="Bendix199"/> Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies (aka [[ethical prophecy|ethical prophecies]]), notably from the [[Near East]] region to the [[exemplary prophecy|exemplary prophecies]] found on the Asiatic mainland, focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one's life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world.<ref name="Bendix199"/><ref name="Bendix90"/> It was those differences that prevented the countries of the [[Western world|Occident]] from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations. His next work, [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]] was an attempt to prove this theory.<ref name="Bendix199"/>

====''Ancient Judaism''====

{{Main|Ancient Judaism (book)}}

In ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'', his fourth major work on the sociology of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors that resulted in the early differences between [[Oriental]] and [[Western culture|Occidental]] [[religiosity]].<ref name="Bendix200"/> He contrasted the innerworldly [[asceticism]] developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India.<ref name="Bendix200"/> Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections.<ref name="Bendix200"/> This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish [[prophecy]].<ref name="Bendix204"/>

Weber claimed that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of the modern Occidental state; Judaism's influence was as important as Hellenistic and Roman cultures.

Weber's death in 1920 prevented him from following his planned analysis of [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Job]], [[Talmudic]] Jewry, early Christianity and [[Islam]].

====Theodicy of fortune and misfortune====

The 'theodicy of fortune and misfortune' within sociology is the theory, as Weber suggested, of how "members of different social classes adopt different belief systems, or theodices, to explain their social situation."<ref name="Plye, Davidson">{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/stratification.htm|title=Stratification|last=Plye, Davidson|first=and James Ralph|publisher=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society|access-date=27 May 2012|archive-date=29 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GFPWt04y?url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/stratification.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The concept of ''[[theodicy]]'' was expanded mainly with the thought of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. There is an ethical part of religion, that includes:<ref name="Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 7">{{cite book |last1=Christiano |first1=Swatos |last2=Kivisto |first2=Kevin |last3=William |first3=Peter |title=Sociology of Religion|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7425-6111-3|location=New York|page=7}}</ref>

# '''[[Soteriology]]''': how people understand themselves to be capable of a ''correct'' relationship with supernatural powers; and
# '''Theodicy''': how to explain evil{{snd}}or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people.

There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class: "theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.{{nbs}}... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved."<ref name="Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 7" />

Weber also distinguishes that, "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God [while] theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next."<ref name="Plye, Davidson" /> Therefore, these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.

Weber defines the importance of societal class within religion by examining the difference between the two theodicies and to what class structures they apply. The concept of "work ethic" is attached to the theodicy of fortune; thus, because of the Protestant "work ethic", there was a contribution of higher class outcomes and more education among Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Christiano |first1=Swatos |last2=Kivisto |first2=Kevin |last3=William |first3=Peter |title=Sociology of Religion|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7425-6111-3|location=New York|page=142}}</ref> Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is that those of lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth.<ref name="Plye, Davidson" />

These two theodicies can be found in the denominational segregation within the religious community. The main division can be seen between the mainline Protestant and evangelical denominations and their relation to the class into which their particular theodicy pertains. For example, mainline churches, with their upper class congregations "promote[d] order, stability, and conservatism, and in so doing proved to be a powerful source of legitimation of the status quo and of existing disparities in the distribution of wealth and power", because much of the wealth of the church comes from the congregation.<ref name="Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 137">{{cite book |last1=Christiano |first1=Swatos |last2=Kivisto |first2=Kevin |last3=William |first3=Peter |title=Sociology of Religion|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7425-6111-3|location=New York|page=137}}</ref> In contrast, [[Pentecostal Churches of Christ|Pentecostal churches]] adopted the theodicy of misfortune. They instead "advocated change intended to advance the cause of justice and fairness".<ref name="Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 137" /> Thus the learned and upper class religious churches who preach the theodicy of fortune, ultimately support capitalism and corporation, while the churches who adopted the theodicy of misfortune, instead preached equality and fairness.

===The state, politics, and government===

{{See also|Max Weber and German politics}}

In [[political sociology]], one of Weber's most influential contributions is his essay "''Politik als Beruf''" ("[[Politics as a Vocation]]"), in which he defines "the [[State (polity)|state]]" as an entity that possesses a [[Monopoly on violence|monopoly on ''the legitimate use of physical force'']].<ref>Weber, Max. 2015 [1919]. "Politics as Vocation". pp. 129–98 in ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters.</ref><ref name="E-PoV" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Phelps|first1=Martha Lizabeth|title=Doppelgangers of the State: Private Security and Transferable Legitimacy|journal=Politics & Policy|date=December 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=824–49|doi=10.1111/polp.12100}}</ref>

Accordingly, Weber proposed that politics is the sharing of state power between various groups, whereas political leaders are those who wield this power.<ref name="E-PoV" /> As such, a politician, in Weber's view, must not be a man of the "true Christian ethic" (i.e. the ethic of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]), in that one cannot have the injunction to 'turn the other cheek'.<ref name="PaV" /> An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood as a [[saint]], for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it.<ref name="PaV" /> The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the [[:de:Verantwortungsethik|''verantwortungsethik'']] and the [[:de:Gesinnungsethik|''gesinnungsethik'']] ("ethic of ''attitude''" and the "ethic of ''responsibility''")<ref>Weber, Marx. 2004 [1919]. "'[https://www.textlog.de/2296.html Gesinnungsethik' versus 'Verantwortungsethik'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923023508/https://www.textlog.de/2296.html |date=23 September 2020 }}". ''[[Politics as a Vocation|Politik als Beruf]]'' [Politk as a Vocation]. – via ''textlog''.</ref> and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).<ref name="PaV" />

Weber distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of political leadership (aka three types of domination, legitimisation or authority):<ref name="Ibrahim, 2012" /><ref>Weber, Max. 2015 [1919]. "Politics as Vocation". pp. 135–36 in ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: [[Palgrave Macmillan]]</ref>

#[[Charismatic authority]] ([[family|familial]] and [[religion and politics|religious]]);
#[[Traditional authority]] ([[patriarch]]s, [[patriarchy|patrimonialism]], [[feudalism]]); and
#[[Legal authority]] (modern law and state, [[bureaucracy]]).<ref name="WolfJM" />

In his view, every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements, which can be analysed on the basis of [[tripartite classification of authority|this tripartite distinction]].<ref name="Bendix296" /> Weber notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to "[[Routinized charisma|routinise]]" into a more structured form of authority.<ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42" /> In a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a "traditional revolution". The move towards a [[rational-legal]] structure of authority, using a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end.<ref name="Bendix303" /> Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the [[social evolutionism]] theory. This ties to his broader concept of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction.<ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42" />
{{quote|Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge.|Max Weber<ref name="Bureaucratic"/>}}

Weber described many ideal types of public administration and government in his masterpiece ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (1922). His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.<ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42" /><ref name="Bureaucratic" /> It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term.<ref name="BuSach" /> Many aspects of modern [[public administration]] go back to him and a classic, hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called "Weberian civil service".<ref name="Hooghe2001" /> As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rational-legal authority and furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society.<ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42" /><ref name="Bureaucratic" />

Weber listed several preconditions for the emergence of the bureaucracy, which resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system, including:<ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176" />

* The growth in space and population being administered
* The growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a [[monetary economy]].<ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176" />

Development of [[information and communications technology|communication]] and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and [[democratisation]] and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176" />

Weber's ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) on the basis of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.<ref name="Bureaucratic" /><ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176" />
{{quote|The decisive reason for the advance of the bureaucratic organisation has always been its purely technical superiority over any other form of organisation.|Max Weber<ref name="Hooghe2001"/>}}

While recognising bureaucracy as the most efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state, Weber also saw it as a threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned "[[iron cage]]" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.<ref name="Bureaucratic" /><ref name="GRitzer" /> To counteract bureaucrats, the system needs entrepreneurs and politicians.<ref name="Bureaucratic" />

====Social stratification====

Weber also formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]], with social class, [[social status]] and political party as conceptually distinct elements.<ref name="Bendix85" /> The three-component theory of stratification is in contrast to [[Karl Marx]] simpler theory of social class that ties all social stratification to what people own. In Weber's theory, issues of honour and prestige are important. This distinction is most clearly described in Weber's essay ''Classes, Staende, Parties'', which was first published in his book Economy and Society.<ref>Max Weber, "The Distribution of Power Within the ''Gemeinschaft:'' Classes, ''Staende'', Parties" pp. 59–72 in ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters.</ref> The three components of Weber's theory are:
* Social class: based on economically determined relationship to the market (owner, [[renting|renter]], employee, etc.)
* [[Social status|Status]] ({{Lang-de|link=no|Stand}}): based on non-economic qualities like honour, prestige and religion
* Party: affiliations in the political domain

All three dimensions have consequences for what Weber called "[[life chances]]" (opportunities to improve one's life).<ref name="Bendix85" /> Weber scholars maintain a sharp distinction between the terms ''status'' and ''class'', even though, in casual use, people tend to use them interchangeably.<ref>Waters, Tony, and Dagmar Waters. 2016."[https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms20162 Are the terms 'socio-economic status' and 'class status' a warped form of reasoning for Max Weber?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028133600/https://www.nature.com/platform/track/article/palcomms20162 |date=28 October 2021 }}" ''[[Palgrave Communications]]'' 2(16002).</ref>

===Study of the city===

As part of his overarching effort to understand the unique development of the Western world, Weber produced a detailed general study of the city as the characteristic locus of the social and economic relations, political arrangements, and ideas that eventually came to define the West. This resulted in a monograph, ''[[The City (Weber book)|The City]]'', which he probably compiled from research conducted in 1911–1913. It was published posthumously in 1921, and, in 1924, was incorporated into the second part of his ''[[Economy and Society]]'', as the sixteenth chapter, "The City (Non-legitimate Domination)".

According to Weber, the city as a politically autonomous organisation of people living in close proximity, employed in a variety of specialised trades, and physically separated from the surrounding countryside, only fully developed in the West and to a great extent shaped its cultural evolution:<ref name="City2">Quoted in {{cite book|last=Bendix|first=Reinhard|url=https://archive.org/details/maxweberintellec0000bend|title=Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait|publisher=University of California Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0-520-03194-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/maxweberintellec0000bend/page/79 79]|author-link=Reinhard Bendix|url-access=registration}}</ref>
{{quote|The origin of a rational and inner-worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets{{nbs}}... who developed in a social context that was alien to the Asiatic cultures. This context consisted of the political problems engendered by the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] status-group of the city, without which neither Judaism, nor Christianity, nor the development of Hellenistic thinking are conceivable.|author=|title=|source=}}

Weber argued that Judaism, early Christianity, theology, and later the political party and modern science, were only possible in the urban context that reached a full development in the West alone.<ref name="SwedbergAgevall-city" /> He also saw in the history of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] European cities the rise of a unique form of "non-legitimate domination" that successfully challenged the existing forms of legitimate domination (traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal) that had prevailed until then in the Medieval world.<ref name="SwedbergAgevall-nonlegitimate" /> This new domination was based on the great economic and military power wielded by the organised community of city-dwellers ("citizens").

===Economics===

Weber regarded himself primarily as a "[[political economy|political economist]]",<ref name="ScienceVoc" /><ref name="WPet" /><ref name="PRBaehr" /> and all his professorial appointments were in economics, though today his contributions in that field are largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern sociology. As an economist, Weber belonged to the "youngest" German [[historical school of economics]].<ref name="capa" /> The great differences between that school's interests and methods on the one hand and those of the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical school]] (from which modern [[mainstream economics]] largely derives) on the other, explain why Weber's influence on economics today is hard to discern.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110220030838/http://homepage.newschool.edu/~het/schools/historic.htm The German Historical School]".

====''Economy and Society''====

{{Main|Economy and Society}}

Weber's magnum opus ''[[Economy and Society]]'' is a collection of his essays that he was working on at the time of his death in 1920. After his death, the final organization and editing of the book fell to his widow [[Marianne Weber|Marianne]]. The final German form published in 1921 reflected very much Marianne's work and intellectual commitment. The composition includes a wide range of essays dealing with Weber's views regarding sociology, [[social philosophy]], politics, [[social stratification]], [[World religions|world religion]], diplomacy, and other subjects.

Beginning in 1956, the German jurist [[Johannes Winckelmann]] began editing and organizing the German edition of ''Economy and Society'' based on his study of the papers that Weber left at his death. English versions of the work were published as a collected volume in 1968, as edited by [[Guenther Roth|Gunther Roth]] and Claus Wittich. As a result of the various editions in German and English, there are differences between the organization of the different volumes. The book is typically published in a two volume set in both German and English, and is more than 1000 pages long.

====Methodological individualism====

Though his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists, with a strong emphasis on interpreting [[economic history]], Weber's defence of "[[methodological individualism]]" in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by [[Carl Menger]], the founder of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, in the context of the academic ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' ("debate over methods") of the late 19th century.<ref name="StanfordIndividualism"/> The phrase ''methodological individualism'', which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]], was coined by the Austrian-American economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber.<ref name="StanfordIndividualism"/> According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully [[Induction (philosophy)|inductive]] or [[Analytic philosophy|descriptive]], because ''understanding'' some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and ''interpret'' it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract "[[ideal type|ideal (pure) types]]".<ref name="capa"/> This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see ''[[Verstehen]]''), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the "[[rational economic man]]" (''[[homo economicus]]''), which is at the heart of modern [[mainstream economics]].<ref name="StanfordIndividualism"/><ref name="capa"/>

====Marginalism and psychophysics====

Unlike other historicists, Weber also accepted the [[Marginalism|marginal theory of value]] (aka "marginalism") and taught it to his students.<ref name="Swedberg-econ-soc"/><ref name="Schweitzer"/> In 1908, Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the [[Weber-Fechner law]]. Max Weber's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of [[psychophysics]] by [[Lionel Robbins]], [[George Stigler]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stigler | first1 = George | year = 1950 | title = The Development of Utility Theory | journal = The Journal of Political Economy | volume = 58 | issue = 5| pages = 373–96 | jstor=1825710 | doi=10.1086/256980| s2cid = 222450704 }}</ref> and [[Friedrich Hayek]], though the broader issue of the relation between economics and psychology has come back into the academic debate with the development of "[[behavioral economics]]".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mass | first1 = Harro | year = 2009 | title = Disciplining Boundaries: Lionel Robbins, Max Weber, and the Borderlands of Economics, History, and Psychology | journal = Journal of the History of Economic Thought | volume = 31 | issue = 4| page = 500 | doi = 10.1017/S1053837209990289 | s2cid = 146195008 }}</ref>

====Economic history====

Weber's best known work in economics concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly the relations between religion and capitalism, which he explored in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' as well as in his other works on the [[sociology of religion]].<ref name="capa"/> He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of [[ancient world|ancient]] capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state.<ref>Weber, Max. ''Selections in Translation''. Trans. Eric Matthews. Ed. W.G. Runciman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. "Urbanisation and Social Structure in the Ancient World", pp. 290–314.</ref> Other contributions include his early work on the [[Die Römische Agrargeschichte in ihrer Bedeutung für das Staats- und Privatrecht|economic history of Roman agrarian society]] (1891) and on the [[Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany|labour relations in Eastern Germany]] (1892), his analysis of the [[Zur Geschichte der Handelsgesellschaften im Mittelalter|history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages]] (1889), his critique of [[Marxism]], the discussion of the roles of [[idealism]] and [[materialism]] in the history of capitalism in his ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (1922) and his ''[[Wirtschaftsgeschichte|General Economic History]]'' (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.<ref name="capa"/>

Although today Weber is primarily read by sociologists and [[Social philosophy|social philosophers]], Weber's work did have a significant influence on [[Frank Knight]], one of the founders of the neoclassical [[Chicago school of economics]], who translated Weber's ''General Economic History'' into English in 1927.<ref name="Emmett"/> Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism "...{{nbs}}from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions, that is, the angle of comparative history in the broad sense."<ref name="Schweitzer" />

====Economic calculation====

Weber, like his colleague [[Werner Sombart]], regarded [[Cost-benefit analysis|economic calculation]] and especially the [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]] method of business accounting, as one of the most important forms of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] associated with the development of modern capitalism.<ref name="SwedbergAgevall2005-22"/> Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to critique socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently to satisfy human needs.<ref name="Tribe"/> Socialist intellectuals like [[Otto Neurath]] had realised that in a completely socialised economy, [[price]]s would not exist and central planners would have to resort to in-kind (rather than monetary) [[economic calculation problem|economic calculation]].<ref name="Tribe" /><ref name="StanfordNeurathSup"/> According to Weber, this type of coordination would be inefficient, especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of [[Imputation (economics)|imputation]] (i.e. of accurately determining the relative values of [[capital good]]s).<ref name="Tribe"/><ref name="StanfordNeurathSup"/> Weber wrote that, under full socialism:<ref name="EconSoc-calculation" />
{{quote|To make possible a rational use of the means of production, a system of in-kind accounting would have to determine "value"{{snd}}indicators of some kind for the individual capital goods which could take over the role of the "prices" used in book valuation in modern business accounting. But it is not at all clear how such indicators could be established and in particular, verified; whether, for instance, they should vary from one production unit to the next (on the basis of economic location), or whether they should be uniform for the entire economy, on the basis of "social utility", that is, of (present and future) consumption requirements{{nbs}}... Nothing is gained by assuming that, if only the problem of a non-monetary economy were seriously enough attacked, a suitable accounting method would be discovered or invented. The problem is fundamental to any kind of complete socialisation. We cannot speak of a rational "planned economy" so long as in this decisive respect we have no instrument for elaborating a rational "plan".|author=|title=|source=}}

This argument against socialism was made independently, at about the same time, by [[Ludwig von Mises]].<ref name="Tribe" /><ref name="Hulsmann"/> Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises, whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918,<ref name="Mises-Weber"/> and, through Mises, on several other economists associated with the Austrian School in the 20th century.<ref name="Haberler"/> [[Friedrich Hayek]] in particular elaborated the arguments of Weber and Mises about economic calculation into a central part of free market economics's intellectual assault on socialism, as well as into a model for the spontaneous coordination of "[[dispersed knowledge]]" in markets.<ref>[[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek, Friedrich]]. 1948.

==Inspirations==
===Kantianism===

Weber's thinking was strongly influenced by [[German idealism]], particularly by [[neo-Kantianism]], which he had been exposed to through [[Heinrich Rickert]], his professorial colleague at the [[University of Freiburg]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from the way the human mind focuses attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist [[Georg Simmel]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Frisby|first=David|title=Georg Simmel|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28535-3|edition=Second|series=Key Sociologists|location=London}}</ref>

Weber was also influenced by [[Kantian ethics]], which he nonetheless came to think of as obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties. In this last respect, the influence of [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy]] is evident.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /> According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the "deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber's ethical worldview."<ref name="plato.stanford.edu" />

===Marxism===

Another major influence in Weber's life was the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics. While Weber shares some of Marx's consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic to the detriment of human freedom and autonomy, Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|288}}

Writing in 1932, [[Karl Löwith]], contrasted the work of Marx and Weber, arguing that both were interested in the causes and effects of Western [[Capitalism]] but that Marx viewed capitalism through the lens of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] while Weber used the concept of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Löwith|first=Karl|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52423743|title=Max Weber and Karl Marx|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-585-44764-0|location=London|oclc=52423743|access-date=18 September 2021|archive-date=28 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028133604/https://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/org.oclc.lac.ui.ajax.ServiceServlet?wcoclcnum=52423743&start_holding=&pgload=&serviceCommand=holdingsdata|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Rp|34}}

Though the influence of his mother's [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] religiosity is evident throughout Weber's life and work as he maintained a deep, lifelong interest in the study of religions, Weber was open about the fact that he was personally irreligious.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Mittleman|first=Alan|year=1999|title=Leo Strauss and Relativism: the Critique of Max Weber|journal=Religion|volume=29|pages=15–27|doi=10.1006/reli.1999.0176}}</ref>

===Economics and historicism===

{{Hatnote|See: section on [[#Economics|Weber and economics]]}}

As a [[Political economy|political economist]] and [[Economic history|economic historian]], Weber belonged to the "youngest" German [[historical school of economics]], represented by academics such as [[Gustav von Schmoller]] and his student [[Werner Sombart]]. However, even though Weber's research interests were very much in line with this school, his views on methodology and the [[Theory of value (economics)|theory of value]] diverged significantly from those of other German [[Historicism|historicists]] and were closer, in fact, to those of [[Carl Menger]] and the [[Austrian School]], the traditional rivals of the historical school.<ref name="Swedberg-econ-soc" /><ref name="StanfordIndividualism" />

===Occultism===

New research suggests that some of Weber's theories, including his interest in the sociology of [[Far Eastern religion]] and elements of his theory of disenchantment, were actually shaped by Weber's interaction with contemporary German [[occult]] figures. He is known to have visited the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] at [[Monte Verità]] shortly before articulating his idea of disenchantment.<ref name="Josephson-Storm" />{{rp|269–70}} He is known to have met the German poet and occultist [[Stefan George]] and developed some elements of his theory of [[charisma]] after observing George. However, Weber disagreed with many of George's views and never formally joined George's occult circle.<ref name="Josephson-Storm" />{{rp|290–93}} Weber may have also had his first exposure to [[Taoism]], albeit in a Westernized form, through [[Gustav Gräser]] at [[Monte Verità]].<ref name="Josephson-Storm" />{{rp|275–76}} Research on Weber's engagement with the occult has led some German and American scholars{{who|date=October 2018}} to re-interpret his theories of disenchantment.

==Legacy==

{{quote|The prestige of Max Weber among European social scientists would be difficult to over-estimate. He is widely considered the greatest of German sociologists and{{nbs}}... has become a leading influence in European and American thought.|[[:de:Hans Heinrich Gerth|Hans Heinrich Gerth]] and [[C. Wright Mills]]|title=''From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology'' (1946)<ref name="WeberGerth1991"/>|source=}}

Weber's most influential work was on [[economic sociology]], [[political sociology]], and the [[sociology of religion]]. Along with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Émile Durkheim]],<ref name="WPet"/> he is commonly regarded as one of the founders of modern sociology. But whereas Durkheim, following [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], worked in the [[sociological positivism|positivist]] tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an [[antipositivism|antipositivist]], [[hermeneutic]], tradition in the [[social sciences]].<ref name="JKRhoads"/> In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues [[Werner Sombart]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences.<ref name="JKRhoads"/>

Weber presented sociology as the science of human [[social action]]; action that he separated into [[Traditional action|traditional]], [[Affectional action|affectional]], [[Value-rational action|value-rational]] and [[Instrumental action|instrumental]].<ref name="Ferrante"/><ref name="Ritzer2009-33"/> To Weber, sociology was:<ref>Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'', in Runciman, W.G., ''Weber: Selections in Translation'', Cambridge University Press, 1991. p. 7.</ref>
{{quote|...{{nbs}}the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By "action" in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful''{{nbs}}... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the "meaning" to be thought of as somehow objectively "correct" or "true" by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history and any kind of ''a priori'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter "correct" or "valid" meaning.|Max Weber|title=''The Nature of Social Action'' (1922)|source=}}

In his own time, however, Weber was viewed primarily as a historian and an economist.<ref name="PRBaehr"/> The breadth of Weber's topical interests is apparent in the depth of his [[social theory]], [[Joachim Radkau]] (2009) writing:<ref name=":0">[[Joachim Radkau|Radkau, Joachim]] and Patrick Camiller (2009). ''Max Weber: A Biography'', translated by P. Camiller. London: [[Polity (publisher)|Polity Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4147-8}}.</ref>{{Rp|(inside sleeve)}}
{{quote|The affinity between capitalism and Protestantism, the religious origins of the Western world, the force of charisma in religion as well as in politics, the all-embracing process of rationalisation and the bureaucratic price of progress, the role of legitimacy and of violence as the offspring of leadership, the "disenchantment" of the modern world together with the never-ending power of religion, the antagonistic relation between intellectualism and eroticism: all these are key concepts which attest to the enduring fascination of Weber's thinking.|author=|title=|source=}}

Many of Weber's works famous today were collected, revised and published [[posthumous work|posthumously]]. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as [[Talcott Parsons]] and C. Wright Mills. Parsons in particular imparted to Weber's works a functionalist, [[teleological]] perspective; this personal interpretation has been criticised for a latent conservatism.<ref>Fish, Jonathan S. 2005. ''Defending the Durkheimian Tradition. Religion, Emotion and Morality''. Aldershot: [[Ashgate Publishing]].</ref>

Weber influenced many later social theorists, such as [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[György Lukács]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Different elements of his thought were emphasised by [[Ludwig Lachmann]],<ref name="Lachmann1970"/> [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], and [[Raymond Aron]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> According to the Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who had met Weber during his time at the University of Vienna, "The early death of this genius was a great disaster for Germany. Had Weber lived longer, the German people of today would be able to look to this example of an '[[Aryan race|Aryan]]' who would not be broken by [[Nazism|National Socialism]]."<ref>[[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises, Ludwig]]. 2009 [1940].

Auburn, AL: [[Mises Institute]]. p. 88.</ref>

Weber's friend, the psychiatrist and existentialist philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], described him as "the greatest German of our era". Weber's untimely death felt to Jaspers "as if the German world had lost its heart".<ref name="Jaspers">Quoted in Baehr, Peter. 2001. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=uN__U6VdHEgC&pg=PA410 The Grammar of Prudence: Arendt, Jaspers and the Appraisal of Max Weber] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225071704/https://books.google.com/books?id=uN__U6VdHEgC&pg=PA410 |date=25 February 2017 }}".

Nicholas Gane, argues that there are similarities between the work of [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] philosopher, [[Michel Foucault]] and Weber, with both thinkers being concerned with the effects of rationalization on how people lead their lives.<ref name="worldcat2002">{{Cite book|last=Gane|first=Nicholas|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48399032|title=Max Weber and postmodern theory : rationalization versus re-enchantment|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=0-333-93058-4|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=48399032|access-date=18 September 2021|archive-date=28 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028133638/https://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/org.oclc.lac.ui.ajax.ServiceServlet?serviceCommand=getAllItemReviews&source=goodReads&maxrecords=3&startrecord=1&isbn=0333930584%25209780333930588%25209786610425129%25206610425124&oclcNum=48399032|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Rp|113}} Gane argues that Foucault goes further than Weber in offering two methods for the individual to resist rationalization: by looking at the history of the development of rationalization in so-called [[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogy]], the factors that influenced this rationalization, and how rationalization differed in the past; and looking at how power relations and current knowledge interaction with particular rationalizations.<ref name="worldcat2002"/>{{Rp|114}}

==Critical responses to Weber==

Weber's explanations are highly specific to the historical periods he analysed.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-150-151" /> Some academics disagree, pointing out that, despite the fact that Weber did write in the early twentieth century, his ideas remain alive and relevant for understanding issues like politics, bureaucracy, and social stratification today.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|1–18}}

Many scholars, however, disagree with specific claims in Weber's historical analysis. For example, the economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1954) argued that capitalism did not begin with the [[Industrial Revolution]] but in 14th century Italy.<ref>{{cite book |last= Schumpeter |first=Joseph |title= History of Economic Analysis |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofeconomi0000schu |url-access= registration | publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1954}}</ref> In [[Milan]], Venice and [[Florence]], the small [[Italian city-states|city-state]] governments led to the development of the earliest forms of capitalism.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title= Economic Thought Before Adam Smith | publisher= Ludwig von Mises Press |year= 1995 |page=142}}</ref> In the 16th century, [[Antwerp]] was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been pointed out that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland.<ref>{{cite book |last= Evans |first= Eric J. |title= The Forging of the Modern State: Early Industrial Britain, 1783–1870 | publisher= Longman |year=1983 |page= 114 |isbn=978-0-582-48969-1}}</ref> Emil Kauder (1953) expanded Schumpeter's argument, by arguing the hypothesis that [[Calvinism]] hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the [[labour theory of value]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Kauder |first=Emil |title= The Retarded Acceptance of the Marginal Utility Theory |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=67 |issue= 4 |pages=564–75 |year=1953 |jstor= 1883602 |doi= 10.2307/1883602}}</ref>

==Works==

For an extensive list of Max Weber's works, see [[Max Weber bibliography]].

Weber wrote in German. Original titles printed after his death (1920) are most likely [[Anthology|compilations]] of his unfinished works (of the ''Collected Essays''{{nbs}}... form). Many translations are made of parts or sections of various German [[original]]s and the names of the translations often do not reveal what part of the original they contain. Weber's writings are generally cited according to the critical ''Max Weber-Gesamtausgabe'' (Collected Works), published by Mohr Siebeck in [[Tübingen]].
