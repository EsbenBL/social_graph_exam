'''Redvers Opie''' (1900–1984) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[economist]].  On the recommendation of [[John Maynard Keynes]], he became the United Kingdom Treasury representative in [[Washington, D.C.]], as Counsellor and economic adviser at the British Embassy, 1939–46, and was one of the five members of the UK delegation to the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], which gave birth to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]].

==Life==
Opie married a daughter of the American economist [[Frank William Taussig|F. W. Tausigg]]. Opie was educated at [[Durham University]], he taught at [[Oxford University]] where he eventually became the [[Bursar]] of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]. He later went on to do a doctorate at [[Harvard University]], where he became a member of the teaching staff.

Among many books, Redvers is perhaps most famous for his translation of ''The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle'' (part of the Harvard Economic Studies series) by [[Joseph A. Schumpeter]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Opie | first1 = Redvers | last2 = Schumpeter | first2 = Joseph A. | author-link2 = Joseph Schumpeter | title = The theory of economic development: an inquiry into profits, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycle | publisher = Transaction Books | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 1983 |orig-date= 1934 | isbn = 9780878556984 }} Translated from the 1911 original German, ''Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung''.</ref>

He moved to [[Mexico]], becoming a naturalized Mexican, where he founded Ecanal in 1976. Ecanal is currently a source of critical analysis of economic and government policy useful for business. Redvers died on February 10, 1984. The sole remaining partner of Ecanal is now [[Rogelio Ramirez de la O]].
