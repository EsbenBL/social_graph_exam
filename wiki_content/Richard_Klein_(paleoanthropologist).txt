'''Richard G. Klein''' (born April 11, 1941) is a Professor of [[Biology]] and [[Anthropology]] at [[Stanford University]]. He is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences. He earned his PhD at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1966, and was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in April 2003. His research interests include [[paleoanthropology]], Africa and Europe. His primary thesis is that modern humans evolved in [[East Africa]] .perhaps 100,000 years ago and, starting 50,000 years ago, began spreading throughout the non-African world, replacing archaic human populations over time. He is a critic of the idea that [[behavioral modernity]] arose gradually over the course of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years or millions of years, instead supporting the view that modern behavior arose suddenly in the transition from the [[Middle Stone Age]] to the [[Later Stone Age]] around 50-40,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Stanford Magazine | date = July–August 2012 | title = Suddenly smarter | author = Mitchell Leslie | url = http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=38306}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Klein was born in 1941 in Chicago, and went to college at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]]. In 1962, he enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Chicago to study with the [[Neanderthal]] expert, [[Francis Clark Howell]]. Of the two theories in vogue then, that Neanderthals had evolved into the [[Cro-Magnons]] of Europe or that they had been replaced by the Cro-Magnons, Klein favored the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|replacement theory]]. Klein completed a master's degree in 1964, and then studied at the [[University of Bordeaux]] with [[François Bordes]], who specialized in [[prehistory]]. There he visited the [[List of Neanderthal sites|La Quina]] and [[La Ferrassie]] caves in southwest France, containing Cro-Magnon artifacts layered on top of Neanderthal ones. These visits influenced him into believing the shift from Neanderthal to modern humans 40,000 to 35,000 years ago was sudden rather than gradual. Klein also visited Russia to examine artifacts.<ref name = PNAS>{{cite journal | journal = PNAS | title = Biography of Richard G.

Klein briefly held positions at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]], and the [[University of Washington, Seattle]], before becoming a professor at the University of Chicago in 1973. Twenty years later, he moved to Stanford University.
