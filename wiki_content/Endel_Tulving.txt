'''Endel Tulving''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|FRSC}} (born May 26, 1927) is an Estonian-born Canadian experimental psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist, known for his pioneering research on human [[memory]]. He is credited with proposing the distinction between [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]]. Tulving is a professor [[emeritus]] at the University of Toronto. He joined the Rotman Research Institute at [[Baycrest Health Sciences]] in 1992 as the first Anne and Max Tanenbaum Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience and remained there until his retirement in 2010. In 2006, he was named an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]], Canada's highest civilian honour.

== Research ==
Tulving has published at least 200 research articles and chapters, and he is widely cited, with an [[h-index]] of 69 (as of April, 2010), and in a ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, he ranked as the 36th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haggbloom|first1=Steven J.|last2=Warnick|first2=Renee|last3=Warnick|first3=Jason E.|last4=Jones|first4=Vinessa K.|last5=Yarbrough|first5=Gary L.|last6=Russell|first6=Tenea M.|last7=Borecky|first7=Chris M.|last8=McGahhey|first8=Reagan|last9=Powell|first9=John L., III|year=2002|title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=139–152|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139|last10=Beavers|first10=Jamie|last11=Monte|first11=Emmanuelle|s2cid=145668721}}</ref> His published works in 1970s were particularly notable because it coincided with the new determination by many cognitive psychologists to confirm their theories in neuroscience using brain-imaging techniques.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The Psychology Book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Sam|last2=Tomley|first2=Sarah|publisher=DK|year=2012|isbn=9781465413857|location=London|pages=191}}</ref> During this period, Tulving mapped the areas of the brain, which are considered active during the encoding and retrieval of memory, effectively associating the medial temporal lobe and the hippocampus with episodic memory.<ref name=":1" /> Tulving has published work on a variety of other topics, including the importance of mental organization of information in memory,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tulving|first1=Endel|year=1962|title=Subjective organization in free recall of "unrelated" words|journal=Psychological Review|volume=69|issue=4|pages=344–354|doi=10.1037/h0043150|pmid=13923056}}</ref> a model of brain hemisphere specialization for episodic memory,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tulving|first1=E.|last2=Kapur|first2=S.|last3=Craik|first3=F.

===Episodic and semantic memory===
Tulving first made the distinction between [[Episodic memory|episodic]] and [[semantic memory]] in a 1972 book chapter.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tulving |first1=E. |year=1972 |chapter=Episodic and semantic memory |editor1-first=E. |editor1-last=Tulving |editor2-first=W. |editor2-last=Donaldson |title=Organization of Memory |pages=381–402 |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press }}</ref>  Episodic memory is the ability to consciously recollect previous experiences from memory (e.g., recalling a recent family trip to Disney World), whereas semantic memory is the ability to store more general knowledge in memory (e.g., the fact that Disney World is in Florida). This distinction was based on theoretical grounds and experimental psychology findings, and subsequently was linked to different neural systems in the brain by studies of brain damage and neuroimaging techniques. At the time, this type of theorizing represented a major departure from many contemporary theories of human learning and memory, which did not emphasize different kinds of subjective experience or brain systems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.21.020170.002253 |title=Memory and Verbal Learning |journal=[[Annual Review of Psychology]] |volume=21 |pages=437–484 |year=1970 |last1=Tulving |first1=E. |last2=Madigan |first2=S. A. }}</ref> Tulving's 1983 book ''Elements of Episodic Memory'' elaborated on these concepts, and has been cited over 3000 times.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to Tulving, the ability to travel back and forward in time mentally is unique to humans and this is made possible by the autonoetic consciousness and is the essence of episodic memory.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memory, Consciousness and the Brain: The Tallinn Conference|last=Tulving|first=Endel|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841690155|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=331}}</ref>

===Encoding specificity principle===
Tulving's theory of "encoding specificity" emphasizes the importance of retrieval cues in accessing episodic memories.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0020071 |title=Encoding specificity and retrieval processes in episodic memory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=352–373 |year=1973 |last1=Tulving |first1=Endel |last2=Thomson |first2=Donald M. |s2cid=14879511 }}</ref> The theory states that effective retrieval cues must overlap with the to-be-retrieved memory trace. Because the contents of the memory trace are primarily established during the initial encoding of the experience, retrieval cues will be maximally effective if they are similar to this encoded information. Tulving has dubbed the process through which a retrieval cue activates a stored memory "synergistic ecphory".{{cite quote|date=January 2020}}

One implication of the encoding specificity principle is that forgetting may be caused by the lack of appropriate retrieval cues, as opposed to decay of a memory trace over time or interference from other memories.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Endel |last1=Tulving |year=1974 |title=Cue-Dependent Forgetting: When we forget something we once knew, it does not necessarily mean that the memory trace has been lost; it may only be inaccessible |journal=American Scientist |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=74–82 |jstor=27844717 }}</ref> Another implication is that there is more information stored in memory relative to what can be retrieved at any given point (i.e., availability vs. accessibility).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(66)80048-8 |title=Availability versus accessibility of information in memory for words |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=381–391 |year=1966 |last1=Tulving |first1=Endel |last2=Pearlstone |first2=Zena }}</ref>

===Amnesia and consciousness===
Tulving's research has emphasized the importance of episodic memory for our experience of consciousness and our understanding of time. For example, he conducted studies with the amnesic patient [[KC (patient)|KC]], who had relatively normal semantic memory but severely impaired episodic memory due to brain damage from a motorcycle accident. Tulving's work with KC highlighted the central importance of episodic memory for the subjective experience of one's self in time, an ability he dubbed "autonoetic consciousness". KC lacked this ability, failing to remember prior events and also failing to imagine or plan for the future.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.10.007 |pmid=15769487 |title=The case of K.C.: Contributions of a memory-impaired person to memory theory |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=989–1021 |year=2005 |last1=Rosenbaum |first1=R. Shayna |last2=Köhler |first2=Stefan |last3=Schacter |first3=Daniel L. |last4=Moscovitch |first4=Morris |last5=Westmacott |first5=Robyn |last6=Black |first6=Sandra E. |last7=Gao |first7=Fuqiang |last8=Tulving |first8=Endel |s2cid=1652523 }}</ref> Tulving also developed a cognitive task to measure different subjective states in memory, called the "remember"/"know" procedure. This task has been used extensively in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tulving |first1=E. |year=1985 |title=Memory and consciousness |journal=Canadian Psychologist |volume=25 |pages=1–12 }}</ref>

===Implicit memory and priming===
Another area where Tulving has had an impact is the distinction between conscious or [[explicit memory]] (such as episodic memory) and more automatic forms of [[implicit memory]] (such as [[Priming (psychology)|priming]]). Along with one of his students, Professor [[Daniel Schacter]], Tulving provided several key experimental findings regarding implicit memory.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.2296719 |pmid=2296719 |jstor=2873625 |title=Priming and human memory systems |journal=Science |volume=247 |issue=4940 |pages=301–6 |year=1990 |last1=Tulving |first1=E. |last2=Schacter |first2=D. |s2cid=40894114 |bibcode=1990Sci...247..301T }}</ref> The distinction between implicit and explicit memory was a topic of debate in the 1980s and 1990s. Tulving and colleagues proposed that these different memory phenomena reflected different brain systems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.4.385 |title=How many memory systems are there? |journal=American Psychologist |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=385–398 |year=1985 |last1=Tulving |first1=Endel |s2cid=36203045 }}</ref> Others{{who|date=October 2018}} argued that these different memory phenomena reflected different psychological processes, rather than different memory systems. These processes would be instantiated in the brain, but they might reflect different aspects of performance from the same memory system, triggered by different task conditions. More recently, theorists have come to adopt components of each of these perspectives.<ref>{{Cite book |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524069.003.0003 |chapter=Components of processing |title=Memory: Systems, Process, or Function? |pages=31–65 |year=1999 |last1=Roediger |first1=Henry L. |last2=Buckner |first2=Randy L. |last3=McDermott |first3=Kathleen B. |isbn=9780198524069 }}</ref>

==Estonian Studies Foundation==
In 1982, architect [[Elmar Tampõld]] proposed the idea of reinvesting Tartu College's surplus revenues for the founding of a Chair of Estonian Studies at the University of Toronto. The university agreed and in 1983, he helped establish the Chair of Estonian Studies Foundation with fellow expatriate Estonian professors, Endel Tulving and chemical engineer [[Olev Träss]]. The three men made the initial presentation to the University of Toronto and Tampõld became the Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Chair of Estonian Studies Foundation.<ref name="utoronto.ca">[https://www.utoronto.ca/estonian/elmar_tampold.htm University of Toronto: Estonian Studies Programme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106074705/http://www.utoronto.ca/estonian/elmar_tampold.htm |date=2014-01-06 }}</ref> Since 1999, Jüri Kivimäe, Professor of History and Chair of Estonian Studies has headed the University of Toronto's Elmar Tampõld Chair of Estonian Studies.<ref>[http://www.ut.ee/365949?print=1 University of Tartu]</ref>
