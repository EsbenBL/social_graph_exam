Drezner|date=26 May 2016|accessdate=25 February 2019|quote=Back in the day, Brad Setser was the go-to guy when it came to debates about cross-border financial flows, macroeconomic imbalances, what China was doing to keep its currency undervalued and whether other countries holding large amounts of U.S. debt was a thing or not. His Council on Foreign Relations blog was a must-read for those in the economics blogosphere who cared about these matters. Then Setser had to go and get a job in the Obama administration. The rest of us were left wandering in the political economy desert.|author-link=Daniel W. Drezner}}</ref>
