'''Jeremy Narby''' (born 1959 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]) is a Canadian [[anthropologist]] and author. In his books, Narby examines shamanism and molecular biology, and shamans' knowledge of botanics and biology through the use of [[entheogens]] across many cultures.

==Early life==
Narby grew up in Montreal, Quebec, and [[Switzerland]]. He studied history at the University of Kent at Canterbury, and received a doctorate in anthropology from [[Stanford University]].

==Career==
Narby spent several years living with the [[Ashaninca]] in the [[Peru]]vian [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] cataloging [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] uses of [[rainforest]] resources to help combat ecological destruction.

Narby has written three books, as well as sponsored an expedition to the rainforest for biologists and other scientists to examine indigenous knowledge systems and the utility of [[Ayahuasca]] in gaining knowledge.
