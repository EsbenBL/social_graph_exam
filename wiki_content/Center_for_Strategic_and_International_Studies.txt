The '''Center for Strategic and International Studies''' ('''CSIS''') is a [[think tank]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4534280 |title=Company Overview of Center for Strategic and International Studies, Inc. |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=2018-09-11 }}</ref> CSIS was founded as the Center for Strategic and International Studies of [[Georgetown University]] in 1962. The center conducts policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world, with a specific focus on issues concerning [[international relations]], trade, technology, finance, energy and [[geostrategy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3456 |title=The Center for Strategic and International Studies |date=2018-03-01 |publisher=Charitynavigator.org |access-date=2018-09-11 }}</ref>

In the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s 2019 ''Global Go To Think Tanks Report'', CSIS is ranked the number one think tank in the United States across all fields, the "Top Defense and National Security Think Tank" in the world, and the 4th best think tank in the world overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.syr.edu/blog/2020/02/12/csis-named-number-one-think-tank-in-the-united-states/|title=CSIS Named Number One Think Tank in the United States|website=SU News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref><ref name=Rankings>{{cite web |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=think_tanks |title=Global Go To Think Tanks Report |publisher=University of Pennsylvania. |access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref> CSIS has been named the number one think tank for Defense and National Security for the past seven years, and has been declared the 'Center of Excellence'.<ref name=Rankings/>

Since its founding, CSIS "has been dedicated to finding ways to sustain American prominence and prosperity as a force for good in the world", according to its website.<ref name="csis.org">{{cite web|url=http://csis.org/about-us|title=About Us - Center for Strategic and International Studies|website=csis.org}}</ref> CSIS is officially a [[bipartisan]] think tank with scholars that represent varying points of view across the [[political spectrum]]. The think tank is known for inviting well-known [[foreign policy]] and public service officials from the [[U.S. Congress]] and the [[executive branch]], including those affiliated with either the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as well as foreign officials of varying political backgrounds. It has been labeled a "centrist" think tank by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref name=CSIScentrist00>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/03/03/think-tank-employees-tend-to-support-democrats|title=Think Tank Employees |publisher=U.S. News & World Report |access-date=October 2, 2013}}</ref>

The center hosts the Statesmen's Forum, a bipartisan venue for international leaders to present their views. Past speakers have included [[UN Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki Moon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Tom Donilon]].<ref name=CSISAnnualReport00>{{cite web |url=http://csis.org/files/publication/130807_annualreport_finalPDF-sm5.pdf |title=CSIS Annual Report 2012|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies |access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref> The center also conducts the CSIS-Schieffer School Dialogues, a series of discussions hosted by [[Bob Schieffer]], of [[CBS News]], in addition to the Global Security Forum, with [[keynote]] addresses by [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] officials including former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Chuck Hagel]].<ref name=CSISGSFHagel00>{{cite web |url=http://csis.org/program/global-security-forum |title=Global Security Forum |publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies |access-date=October 2, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Mccain bower.jpg|thumb|Senator [[John McCain]] at CSIS]]

===1960s===
The center was founded in 1962{{cn|date=July 2021}} by [[Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]] and Ambassador [[David Manker Abshire]],<ref name="The" /> originally as part of [[Georgetown University]]. It officially opened its doors on September 4, shortly before the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The original office was located one block away from Georgetown's campus in a small brick townhouse located at 1316 36th Street. The first professional staff member hired was [[Richard V. Allen]] who later served in the [[presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]].{{sfn|Smith|1993|p=17}}

At a conference held in the Hall of Nations at Georgetown in January 1963,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AhNNDwAAQBAJ&q=CSIS+conference+in+the+hall+of+nations+at+georgetown&pg=PA64 |title=The Statesman: Reflections on a Life Guided by Civility, Strategic Leadership, and the Lessons of History (p. 64) |last=Abshire |first=David |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |access-date=2018-09-11 |isbn=9781538109229 }}</ref> the center developed its blueprint for its intellectual agenda. The book that emerged from the conference, ''National Security: Political, Military and Economic Strategies in the Decade Ahead'', was more than one thousand pages long.{{sfn|Abshire|Allen|1963}} The book set out a framework for discussing national security and defined areas of agreement and disagreement within the Washington foreign policy community during the [[Cold War]]. The book argued for a strategic perspective on global affairs and also defined a school of thought within [[international relations]] studies for that period. The practitioners of this school of thought subsequently made their way to the pinnacles of U.S. policymaking, particularly during the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations.{{sfn|Smith|1993|p=23–26}}

===1970–1989===
By the mid to late 1970s, many scholars who worked at the center had found their way to senior positions in government in the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] or Department of Defense. When [[Henry Kissinger]] retired from his position as [[U.S. Secretary of State]] in 1977,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/people/henry-kissinger-9366016 |title=Henry Kissinger Biography |publisher=biography.com |access-date=2018-09-11 }}</ref> [[Harvard University]] declined to offer him a professorship. He decided to teach part-time at Georgetown's [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19770609-01.2.3 |title=Kissinger agrees to instruct undergrads at Georgetown |date=1977-06-09 |publisher=Columbia Spectator |access-date=2018-09-11 }}</ref> and to make CSIS the base for his Washington operations, over offers to teach at [[Yale University|Yale]], Penn, [[Columbia University in the City of New York|Columbia]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]].<ref name=Kissinger>{{cite web |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/henry-kissinger-returns-to-harvard |title=A Harvard-Henry Kissinger Détente?|work=Harvard Magazine |access-date=October 4, 2013|date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> He still maintains an office suite at CSIS and continues to work as counselor to CSIS and as a trustee. Kissinger's decision to become affiliated with the Washington-based institution attracted more public attention for the center than virtually any event in the preceding fifteen years.{{sfn|Smith|1993|p=96–97}}

Following Kissinger's involvement, other cabinet-level officials also made CSIS at least a part-time base of operations. Such senior officials as [[James Schlesinger]], [[Bill Brock]], [[Admiral]] [[William J. Crowe]] and [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]] joined CSIS in the late 1970s. When [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] joined the center in 1981 after the end of the [[Carter administration]], he worked on issues related to the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Economy of Poland|Poland's transition to a market economy]]. The arrangements for these senior government officials allowed them to write, lecture and consult with media and business firms and are typical of the way CSIS can incorporate high-level policymakers when they leave government.{{sfn|Smith|1993|p=98–102}} During the 1970s and 1980s, a myriad of think tanks either expanded operations or emerged in Washington representing a range of ideological positions and specialized policy interests.<ref name=ThinkTank>{{cite web |url=http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/history/american/Dictionary%20of%20American%20History%203rd%20Vol%2008.pdf |title=Think Tanks|work=Dictionary of American History, 3rd Edition |access-date=October 4, 2013}}</ref> For senior government officials, there was a move away from accepting formal arrangements with universities toward the freedom and influence a [[think tank]] could provide.

Some of Georgetown University's professors criticized CSIS staff members for giving academically unsupported assessments of foreign policy issues during public interviews.<ref name= sever>Jordan, Mary. "GU Severs Ties With Think Tank: Center's Academics, Conservatism Cited". ''The Washington Post''. 18 October 1986. p. B1.</ref> Donations to Georgetown University decreased because of its association with CSIS.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} A special committee studied the friction, and its report stated that CSIS was more focused on the media than to scholarly research and recommended that CSIS be formally separated from Georgetown University.<ref name= sever/> On 17 October 1986, Georgetown University's [[board of directors]] voted to sever all ties with CSIS.<ref name= sever/>

The Center for Strategic and International Studies was incorporated in the [[District of Columbia]] on December 29, 1986,<ref>"[https://corponline.dcra.dc.gov/BizEntity.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityId=2797597 Center for Strategic and International Studies Inc]". ''Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs''. Government of the District of Columbia. Retrieved 29 June 2017.</ref> and the formal affiliation between Georgetown and CSIS ended on July 1, 1987.

The Center became an incorporated [[nonprofit organization]] to raise its endowment and expand its programs to focus on emerging regions of the world. The work of the trustees and counselors with the Center after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the 1980s left CSIS in a unique position to develop the nation's foreign policy with the United States as the world's sole [[superpower]]. It signified a degree of institutional maturation and prestige that the founders had not imagined when they founded the center in the early 1960s.{{sfn|Smith|1993|p=97}}

===1989–present===

After the end of the Cold War, there emerged a suspicion in Washington that the United States was not well equipped as it ought to be to compete in the international economy. This outlook drove CSIS to set up a project in 1990 that, to some, seemed remote from traditional strategic and international concerns.{{sfn|Smith|1993|p=180–181}} The idea that America should focus at its problems at home to strengthen its role abroad evolved into the Commission on the Strengthening of America, chaired by [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Sam Nunn]] and Senator [[Pete Domenici]].

[[David Abshire]] saw the commission as a way to examine and improve upon economic policy, coming to the conclusion that the White House should reorganize the [[Executive Office of the President]] to include a [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]] with a national economic adviser on the model of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].{{sfn|Smith|1993|p=183}} This new focus on economic policy led CSIS to increase its research focus on [[international economics]] and issues concerning the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]] as well as [[global health]] and the [[Human impact on the environment|environmental]] and societal effects of [[climate change]]. These issues merged into CSIS's mission to complement its traditional focus on [[international security]] issues. Into the present day, CSIS has been dedicated to finding ways to sustain American prominence and prosperity as a force for good in the world, according to the CSIS website.<ref name="csis.org"/>

In 2013, CSIS moved from its [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]] headquarters to a new location on [[Rhode Island Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Rhode Island Avenue]] in Washington, D.C. The new building cost $100 million to build and has a studio for media interviews and room to host conferences, events, lectures and discussions. The building is located in Washington, D.C.'s [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood and will earn [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum Certification.<ref name="CSISNewBuilding00">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/think-tanked/post/a-look-at-csiss-new-100-million-building/2011/05/24/AFhkAZAH_blog.html|title=A look at CSIS's new $100 million building|work=The Washington Post|access-date=October 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/us/politics/think-tanks-research-and-corporate-lobbying.html|title=How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America's Influence|last1=Lipton|first1=Eric|date=2016-08-07|last2=Williams|first2=Brooke|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/news/csis-break-ground-new-headquarters-1616-rhode-island-ave|title=CSIS to Break Ground for New Headquarters at 1616 Rhode Island Ave {{!}} Center for Strategic and International Studies|website=www.csis.org|access-date=2016-09-06}}</ref>

[[H. Andrew Schwartz]], a senior vice president at CSIS, in 2015 was quoted describing the organization's "number one goal" as "hav[ing] impact on policy."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/10/05/are-think-tanks-obsolete/|title=Are think tanks obsolete?|last=Bennett|first=Amanda|date=2015-10-05|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-09-06}}</ref> Defending the organization from claims that it had inappropriately engaged in lobbying on behalf of U.S. defense contractors, CEO John Hamre was quoted in 2016 as saying, "We strongly believe in our model of seeking solutions to some of our country's most difficult problems.... We gather stakeholders, vet ideas, find areas of agreement and highlight areas of disagreement."<ref name=":0" />

==Programs and events==
[[File:CSISoffice2.jpg|thumb|right|Office of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in [[Washington, D.C.]] The headquarters is located in the [[DuPont Circle]] neighborhood near many other well-known think tanks.]]

CSIS also has several endowed chairs in economics, [[Sinology|Chinese studies]], and other subjects.

CSIS has often provided a platform for high-profile figures to make important statements about international relations issues. For example, in September 2019, former National Security Advisor [[John Bolton]] delivered his first speech since leaving office at CSIS, and used the opportunity to be highly critical of US policy towards [[North Korea]].<ref name=Bolton>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2019/9/30/20891290/north-korea-trump-bolton-csis-speech |title=John Bolton says what he finally thinks about Trump's North Korea policy - Bolton slams Trump in his first public comments since leaving the White House |publisher=Vox|date=September 30, 2019|access-date=December 18, 2019}}</ref>

In 2012, CSIS hosted U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] as she delivered a keynote address on "U.S. Strategic Engagement with North Africa in an Era of Change," that addressed the security of embassies in the wake of the [[2012 Benghazi attack]].<ref name=ClintonQuote>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/10/199102.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013193028/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/10/199102.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 13, 2012 |title=John Bolton finally says what he really thinks about Trump's North Korea policy - Bolton slams Trump in his first public remarks since leaving the White House |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=October 4, 2013}}</ref>

Annually, the Center hosts more than 400 major events and hosts over 18,000 guests. In 2013, CSIS had over 180,000 webcast attendees. Recent CSIS speaker events have included the following: [[Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Shinzō Abe]], [[World Bank]] President [[Jim Yong Kim]], former Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Chairman and CEO [[John S. Watson (Chevron)|John Watson]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]] CEO [[Peter Voser]], former U.S. National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[General]] [[Martin Dempsey]].

===Project on Nuclear Issues===
The '''Project on Nuclear Issues''' ('''PONI''') is a program hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) to advance the public debate about the future role nuclear technology will play on the world stage. Created in 2003 with support from a few government agencies and private donations, PONI has two stated goals. First, it seeks to "build and sustain a networked community of young nuclear experts from the military, the national laboratories, industry, academia, and the policy community." Second, "<nowiki>[work]</nowiki> to contribute to the debate and leadership on nuclear issues by generating new ideas and discussions among both its members and the public-at-large."<ref name=poni>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/programs/international-security-program/project-nuclear-issues|title=Project on Nuclear Issues &#124; Center for Strategic and International Studies|website=www.csis.org}}</ref>

Regarding its philosophy, the PONI public website states:
<blockquote>
"Perhaps the most critical challenge in sustaining the US nuclear deterrent after the end of the Cold War is maintaining the human infrastructure necessary to support US nuclear capabilities. This is especially true as the human infrastructure necessary to support a nuclear stockpile at the envisioned level of 1700-2200 operational warheads is not appreciably smaller than that necessary to support one at current levels. The challenge is therefore to maintain a smaller, but still vibrant, community of nuclear experts."<ref name=poni/>
</blockquote>

[[Clark A. Murdock]] started PONI when it was widely recognized that the nuclear community faced an impending crisis. With the widespread and rapid retirement of nuclear scientists and experts from the national laboratories, private industry, and the government. His study ''Revitalizing the U.S. Nuclear Deterrent'', co-authored with [[Michèle Flournoy]], documented these concerns with shocking clarity. Clark initiated PONI out of concern about the future leadership and expertise of the nuclear community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alsos.wlu.edu/information.aspx?id=2027|title=Digital Library for Nuclear Issues}}</ref>
