'''Tim D. White''' (born August 24, 1950) is an American [[paleoanthropologist]] and Professor of Integrative Biology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He is best known for leading the team which discovered [[Ardi]], the type specimen of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'', a 4.4 million-year-old likely human ancestor. Prior to that discovery, his early career was notable for his work on [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] as ''Australopithecus afarensis'' with discoverer [[Donald Johanson]].

==Career==
Timothy Douglas White was born on August 24, 1950, in [[Los Angeles County]], California and raised in [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]] in neighboring [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]].<ref name=achievement>{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/whi0bio-1|title=Tim D.

He received his Ph.D. in [[physical anthropology]] from the [[University of Michigan]].

He is director of the Human Evolution Research Center and co-director, with [[Berhane Asfaw]], [[Yonas Beyene]], and [[Giday WoldeGabriel]], of the Middle Awash Research Project.

White has taught and mentored many paleoanthropologists who have subsequently gone on to prominence in the field, including [[Berhane Asfaw]], William Henry Gilbert, [[Yohannes Haile-Selassie]], and [[Gen Suwa]].

Since 2013, White has been listed on the Advisory Council of the [[National Center for Science Education]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |title=Advisory Council |website=ncse.com |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810112828/https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |archive-date=2013-08-10 |access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>

==Collaborations==
In 1974, White worked with [[Richard Leakey]]'s team at [[Koobi Fora, Kenya]]. Leakey was so impressed with White's work that he recommended him to his mother, [[Mary Leakey]], to help her with [[Hominidae|hominid]] fossils she had found at [[Laetoli, Tanzania]].

White took a job at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1977 and collaborated with [[J. Desmond Clark]] and [[Francis Clark Howell|F. Clark Howell]]. In 1994, White discovered 4.4 million-year-old ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'', a likely human ancestor from an era which was previously empty of fossil evidence. Near the Awash River in Ethiopia, he found an almost complete fossilized female skeleton, named "[[Ardi]]". He took nearly 15 years to prepare publication of the description.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = Tim D. | last2 = Asfaw | first2 = Berhane | last3 = Beyene | first3 = Yonas | last4 = Haile-Selassie | first4 = Yohannes | last5 = Lovejoy | first5 = C.

In 1996, White, along with paleontologist [[Berhane Asfaw]] discovered fossils of a 2.5 million-year-old species BOU-VP-12/130 ''[[Australopithecus garhi]]'', which is thought to predate ''[[H. habilis]]'' tool use and manufacturing by 100,000 to 600,000 years.
