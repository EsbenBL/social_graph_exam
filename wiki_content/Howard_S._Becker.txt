==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Howard Saul Becker was born April 18, 1928, in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the son of Allan Becker (April 2, 1902 – March 27, 1988) and Donna Becker (born Bertha Goldberg; December 31, 1904 – 1997).<ref name="students"/> His great-grandfather, Gershon Movsha Becker, immigrated to the United States from [[Lithuania]]. Becker began playing piano at an early age and by age 15 worked as a pianist in bars and strip joints and, later, with a campus band at Northwestern University.<ref name="Campbell">{{Cite web |url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/substance.abuse.history/oral_history_interviews%26mode%3Dsingle%26recordID%3D2287158%26nextMode%3Dlist |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317042321/http://sitemaker.umich.edu/substance.abuse.history/oral_history_interviews%26mode%3Dsingle%26recordID%3D2287158%26nextMode%3Dlist |archive-date=2011-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to Becker, he was able to work semi-professionally because of [[World War II]] and the fact that most musicians over the age of 18 were drafted.<ref name="Campbell"/> It was through his work as a musician Becker first became exposed to drug culture, which he would later study.<ref name="Campbell"/>

Becker received his undergraduate degree in sociology at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1946.<ref name="vita">[http://www.howardsbecker.com/vita.html ''Vita''], available at Becker's website, last visited 2013/04/16.</ref>  While in school, Becker continued to play piano semi-professionally.<ref name="Mueller">{{cite web|url=http://howardsbecker.com/articles/Suisse%20English.html |title=Articles |publisher=Howardsbecker.com |date=2008-10-20 |access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>  According to Becker, he viewed music as his career and sociology as a hobby.<ref name="Mueller"/>  Even so, he went on to get both his MA and PhD in sociology from the University of Chicago<ref name="vita"/> where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on Chicago school teachers.<ref name="Plummer"/> At the University of Chicago, Becker was taught in the tradition of the original [[Chicago School of Sociology]].<ref name="Plummer"/> Becker and his colleagues, including [[Erving Goffman]] and [[Anselm Strauss]], would later be considered part of the "second Chicago School of Sociology".<ref name="Chicago School">{{cite web|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~lutters/pubs/1996_SWLNote96-1_Lutters,Ackerman.pdf |title=1.0_Introduction |access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>

The Chicago School of Sociology focused heavily on qualitative data analysis and worked with the city of [[Chicago]] as a laboratory.<ref name="Chicago School"/>  Much of Becker's early work was guided in the Chicago School tradition, in particular by [[Everett Hughes (sociologist)|Everett C. Hughes]] who served as Becker's mentor and advisor.<ref name="Chicago"/>  Becker is also often labeled a [[symbolic interactionist]], even though he doesn't accept the label.<ref name="Plummer"/> According to Becker, his academic lineage is [[Georg Simmel]], [[Robert E. Park]], and [[Everett Hughes (sociologist)|Everett Hughes]].<ref name="Plummer"/>

After receiving his PhD at the age of 23, Becker studied marijuana use at the Institute for Juvenile Research.<ref name="Campbell"/>  He was later awarded a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Illinois from 1953 to 1955,<ref name="vita"/> and then spent three years as a research associate at Stanford University's Institute for the Study of Human Problems before beginning his teaching career.<ref name="vita"/>

===Teaching career===
After receiving his doctorate at the University of Chicago, Becker worked for three years as an instructor in sociology and social sciences at the University of Chicago.<ref name="vita"/>  In 1965, Becker became a professor of sociology at Northwestern University, where he taught until 1991.<ref name="vita"/>  During his career at Northwestern, Becker also taught as a visiting professor at the University of Manchester and as a visiting scholar at the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name="vita"/>  In 1991, Becker became a professor of sociology and, in 1996, an adjunct professor of music, at the University of Washington until he retired in 1999.<ref name="vita"/>

Becker has also been the recipient of numerous awards and honors in his field.<ref name="vita"/> These include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1978–1979, the Charles Horton Cooley Award, awarded by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction, in 1980, the Common Wealth Award in 1981, the Cooley/Mead Award in the Section on Social Psychology, awarded by the American Sociological Association in 1985, the George Herbert Mead Award given by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction in 1987, and the Award for a Career of Distinguished Scholarship, American Sociological Association, 1998.<ref name="vita"/> Becker also holds honorary degrees from Université de Paris VIII, Université Pierre Mendes-France, Grenoble, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, and École Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines, Lyon.<ref name="vita"/>

===Retirement===
Becker currently resides in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref name="news">{{cite web|url=http://howardsbecker.com/news.html|title=News & Notes|website=howardsbecker.com}}</ref>  He also spends three to four months out of the year in Europe, mostly in [[Paris]].<ref name="news"/> Although no longer teaching full-time, Becker continues to write<ref name="articles">{{cite web|url=http://howardsbecker.com/articles.html|title=Articles|website=howardsbecker.com}}</ref> and record music.<ref name="music">{{cite web|url=http://howardsbecker.com/music.html|title=My Music|website=howardsbecker.com}}</ref>

In 2004, ''Un sociologue en liberté: Lecture d’Howard S. Becker'' by French sociologist [[Alain Pessin]] was released in France.<ref name="books">{{cite web|url=http://howardsbecker.com/books.html|title=Favorite Websites|website=howardsbecker.com}}</ref>  In the book, Pessin examines Becker's work and contributions to the field of sociology.<ref name="books"/>

==Contributions==

===Sociology of deviance and labeling theory===
Although Becker does not claim to be a deviancy specialist, his work on the subject is often cited by sociologists and criminologists studying deviance.<ref name="Plummer"/>  Becker's 1963 book ''Outsiders'' is credited as one of the first books on [[labeling theory]] and its application to studies of deviance.<ref name="books"/> Becker explored the theory in which deviance is simply a social construction used to persuade the public to fear and criminalize certain groups. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Key Themes in Media Theory|last=Laughey|first=Dan|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|location=Berkshire, England|page=91}}</ref> A compilation of early essays on the subject, ''Outsiders'' outlines Becker's theories of deviance through two deviant groups; marijuana users and dance musicians.<ref name="outsiders">Becker, Howard S.  (1963).  ''Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance.''  New York:Macmillan.</ref>  In the book, Becker defines deviance as "not a quality of a bad person but the result of someone defining someone’s activity as bad."<ref name="books"/>

Becker is widely known for his work on drug culture, particularly his studies on marijuana use.<ref name="Campbell"/>  Chapters three and four of ''Outsiders'', which were originally published in the ''American Journal of Sociology'' in 1953, examine how marijuana users come to be labeled as social deviants.<ref name="outsiders"/>  Becker was inspired to write on the subject after reading [[Alfred Lindesmith]]'s book on opium addiction.<ref name="Plummer"/>  As a musician, Becker had first hand experience with drug culture and was able to obtain interview participants through his connections to the music scene.<ref name="Campbell"/>  The first of the articles, "Becoming a Marihuana User", outlines how social interaction plays a role in learning to use and enjoy the effects of the drug.<ref name="outsiders"/>  The second, "Marijuana Use and Social Control", describes how mechanisms of control serve to limit use of the drug and further label users as deviants.<ref name="outsiders"/>  In the late 1960s, Becker wrote two additional articles on drug culture: "History, Culture and Subjective Experience: An Exploration of the Social Bases of Drug–Induced Experiences" and "Ending Campus Drug Incidents".<ref name="vita"/>  Even though he has not written anything on drug culture since the 1970s, Becker is still widely recognized as an influential researcher in the field.<ref name="Campbell"/>

Another contribution Becker made to the [[sociology of deviance]] were his studies on deviant cultures.  In ''Outsiders'', Becker examined the formation of deviant cultures through his observations of musicians.<ref name="outsiders"/>  The musicians, according to Becker, place themselves counter to non-musicians or "squares", which in turn strengthens and isolates them as a deviant culture.<ref name="outsiders"/>  Another important contribution Becker makes through his studies of deviant culture is the concept of "deviant careers".<ref name="outsiders"/>  In the case of musicians, Becker examines the consequences of an individual choosing an occupation that is already located within a deviant group and how this in turn labels the actor choosing the career as deviant.<ref name="outsiders"/>  Becker's work on deviant careers is greatly influenced by the work of his mentor [[Everett Hughes (sociologist)|Everett Hughes]].<ref name="Plummer"/>

Becker's work on deviance has solidified him as one of the founders of [[labeling theory]].<ref name="fsu">{{cite web |url=http://criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/becker.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209021929/http://criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/becker.htm |archive-date=2011-12-09 }}</ref>  [[Labeling theory]] is based on the idea that a social deviant is not an inherently deviant individual, rather they become deviant because they are labeled as such.<ref name="fsu"/>  In the first chapter of ''Outsiders'', Becker explains:

{{quote|...&nbsp;''social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction creates deviance'', and by applying those roles to particular people and labeling them as outsiders. From this point of view, deviance is ''not'' a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by other of rules and sanctions to an "offender." The deviant is one to whom that label has been successfully applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label.<ref name="outsiders"/>}}

According to Becker, not all individuals who are labeled deviant must remain deviant, however once labeled deviant it becomes more likely an individual will take deviant paths.<ref name="outsiders"/> In 1973, Becker rereleased ''Outsiders'' with a final chapter titled "Labeling Theory Reconsidered."<ref name="outsiders"/>  In the chapter, Becker responds to critics who argue that [[labeling theory]] fails to provide an [[etiological]] explanation of deviance or an explanation of how individuals come to commit deviant acts in the first place.<ref name="outsiders"/>  Becker explains that the theory was not meant to be taken as an overarching theory of deviance, nor was it meant to explain deviant behaviors as simply the product of outside influence.<ref name="outsiders"/>  Rather, [[labeling theory]] was meant to "focus attention on the way labeling places the actor in circumstances which make it harder for him to continue the normal routines of everyday life and thus provoke him to "abnormal" actions."<ref name="outsiders"/>

===Sociology of art===
After writing his dissertation, Becker grew an interest in the sociological study of art.<ref name="Plummer"/>  Becker believed that the field was underdeveloped and consisted mainly of thinly veiled value judgements of particular artists.<ref name="Plummer"/>  Unlike previous work in the [[sociology of art]], Becker approached art as "collective action" and studied art as an occupation.<ref name="worlds">Becker, Howard S.  (1982).  ''Art Worlds.''  CA: University of California Press.</ref>

One of Becker's main contributions to the field was the idea of art as a product of collective action.<ref name="Plummer"/>  In his 1982 book ''Art Worlds'', Becker describes how a work of art is formed through the coordination of many individuals.<ref name="worlds"/>  According to Becker, without each of the individuals who produce materials necessary to construct art, it becomes difficult if not impossible to create art.<ref name="worlds"/>  Becker also references how the [[division of labor]] plays a role in the creation of art work, in that the work of many individuals goes into the production of the tools and routines of the artist.<ref name="worlds"/>  In addition to the tools necessary for the process of creation, Becker also emphasizes the role of shared meaning plays in ascribing value to art.<ref name="worlds"/>  In other words, Becker believes without a common understanding of a work's value, it is difficult for it to have any social resonance.<ref name="worlds"/>

In addition to ''Art Worlds'', Becker has written numerous essays on the sociology of art.<ref name="vita"/>  Two volumes of these essays have been translated in French; ''Paroles et Musique'' and ''Propos sur l'art''.<ref name="books"/>  Also, in 2006, Becker edited and contributed to ''Art from Start to Finish'', a compilation of sociological essays addressing the question of how an artists decides when a work is finished.<ref name="books"/>  Along with his writings on the subject, Becker also taught a course on the sociology of art.<ref name="Plummer"/>

===Writing style and methodology===
In addition to Becker's contributions to sociological theory, he has also written extensively on the practice of [[sociology]].<ref name="Cluley">Cluley, Robert.  (2009).  "Book Reviews: ''Telling About Society.''"  ''The Sociological Review.''  57:2.</ref>  In ''Writing for Social Scientists'' (1986), Becker offers advice to individuals interested in social science writing.<ref name="books"/>  According to Becker, the book is composed of information he learned from students while teaching a seminar at [[Northwestern University]] on sociological writing style.<ref name="writing">Becker, Howard S.  (1986).  ''Writing for Social Scientists: How to Start and Finish Your Thesis, Book, or Article.''  Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press.</ref>  In an interview, Becker states "bad sociological writing cannot be separated from the theoretical problems of the discipline."<ref name="Plummer"/>  Thus, Becker advises scholars to write in a direct style, avoiding the [[passive voice]] and [[abstract nouns]].<ref name="writing"/>

In ''Tricks of the Trade'', Becker outlines his ideas on sociological methods.<ref name="books"/>  The book focuses on Becker's belief that it is impossible to establish a method of research independent of the situation it is being used in.<ref name="Plummer"/>  According to Becker, the principles of social research he describes in the book are based primarily on what he learned from his professors and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="tricks">Becker, Howard S.  1998.  ''Tricks of the Trade: How to Think About Your Research While You're Doing It.''  Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</ref>  Furthermore, Becker promotes systematic data collection and rigorous analysis as a way to make sense of social world.<ref name="Horowitz">Horowitz, Ruth.  "Book Review: ''Tricks of the Trade.''"  ''Symbolic Interaction.''  22(4):385-387.</ref>

In ''Telling About Society'', considered the third installment in Becker's series of writing guides,<ref name="Cluley"/> Becker argues that socially produced texts, or artifacts can be valuable sources of information about the society which has produced them.<ref name="books"/>  As in earlier works, he stresses the importance of studying the activities and processes which have created these artifacts, as opposed to just studying the objects themselves.<ref name="telling">Becker, Howard S.  (2007).  ''Telling About Society.''  Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</ref>
