'''Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt''' ([[Hebrew]]: שמואל נח אייזנשטדט&lrm; 10 September 1923, [[Warsaw]] &ndash; 2 September 2010, [[Jerusalem]])<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3948435,00.html Israel Prize laureate Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt dies at 87]</ref> was an [[Israel]]i [[sociology|sociologist]]. In 1959 he was appointed to a teaching post in the sociology department of the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]]. From 1990 until his death in September 2010 he was professor [[emeritus]]. He held countless guest professorships, at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Zurich]], the [[University of Vienna]], the [[University of Bern]], [[Stanford]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]], among others. Eisenstadt received a number of prizes, including the [[Balzan prize]] and the Max-Planck research prize. He was also the 2006 winner of the [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]]. He was a member of many academies, including the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the Advisory Editors Council of the [[Social Evolution & History]] Journal. His daughter [[Irit Meir]] was a noted scholar of Israeli sign language.

In the field of sociology he became known as a "sociologist of youth" (after a term in ''From Generation to Generation'', a work closely related to the ideas of [[Talcott Parsons]]). However:
<blockquote>Eisenstadt's research contributed considerably to the understanding that the modern trend of a eurocentric interpretation of the cultural program developed in the west is a natural development model seen in all societies ... the European model is only one: it was merely the earliest. It started the trend. But social reactions, whether in the USA, Canada, Japan or in Southeast Asia took place with completely different cultural reagents. (''Frankfurter Rundschau'', March 22, 2000)</blockquote>

==Background and education==
Eisenstadt was born in 1923 in [[Warsaw]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. In the early 1930s his widowed mother took him to Jerusalem and he was educated in Palestine from the age of 12. In 1940, Eisenstadt studied at the Hebrew University where he received his M.A. and Ph.D. in sociology.<ref name=lebenslauf>"Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt." Lebenslauf.</ref> After the 1947&ndash;48 school year, he went back to Jerusalem to be an assistant lecturer in [[Martin Buber]]'s department under whom he had written his master's thesis. Eisenstadt stayed at the Hebrew University and began teaching there, served as the Chairman of the Department of Sociology from 1950 to 1969, and also served as Dean of the Faculty of Humanities for a few years.<ref name=lebenslauf/>

Eisenstadt contributed to the understanding of cultures and civilizations. As a social scientist, "Eisenstadt has focused on the interplay between cultural and structural processes of change and on inherent tensions and antinomies rather than on uniform process of development"<ref name=wittrock>Wittrock, Bjorn. "Presentation of Shmuel N. Eisenstadt." Norwegian (2006).</ref> Eisenstadt researched broad themes of social change, modernities and civilizations.<ref name=wittrock/> One of his arguments is that "fundamentalism is not a traditional but a modern phenomenon".<ref name=wittrock/>

Eisenstadt summed up his views by saying "I try to understand what was the historical experience of the great civilizations...to try to understand the major dynamics of these civilizations and how they became modern societies, how they modernize and how they develop different cultural programs of modernity".<ref>"14 to Receive Honorary Degrees." The Harvard Crimson 10 June 1993.</ref>

In honor of Eisenstadt's contributions to sociology Erik Cohen, Moshe Lissak, and Uri Almagor compiled the book, ''Comparative Social Dynamics: Essays in Honor of S.N Eisenstadt''.<ref>Westview Press, 1985</ref> The contributions of this book were written by Eisenstadt's former students and colleagues at the Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The articles relate to Eisenstadt's major themes in the study of cultures, modernization, and social and political change. Eisenstadt's work touches many different fields of sociology, time periods and cultures and the editors felt the leading concept of Eisenstadt's work was social dynamics.
