'''Saskia Sassen''' (born January 5, 1947) is a Dutch-American [[sociologist]] noted for her analyses of [[globalization]] and international [[human migration]]. She is [[Robert S. Lynd]] Professor of Sociology at [[Columbia University]] and Centennial visiting Professor at the [[London School of Economics]]. Sassen coined the term [[global city]].

==Family and early life==
Sassen was born in [[The Hague, Netherlands]] in 1947. In 1948 Sassen's parents, [[Willem Sassen]] and Miep van der Voort, moved to [[Argentina]] and the family lived in [[Buenos Aires]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parry|first1=Marc|title=Saskia Sassen's Missing Chapter|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=December 5, 2014|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Saskia-Sassens-Missing/150337/|access-date=15 September 2015}}</ref> Her father was a Dutch collaborator with the [[National Socialism|Nazis]], a Nazi journalist, and a member of the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''. In the 1950s Willem Sassen was close to [[Adolf Eichmann]] when both were living in Argentina, and she recalls him visiting her childhood home.<ref>http://chronicle.com/article/Saskia-Sassens-Missing/150337/</ref> Saskia Sassen also spent part of her youth in Italy and says she was "brought up in five languages."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.delta.tudelft.nl/artikel/wroeten-in-de-mondiale-stad/9130 |title=Wroeten in de mondiale stad |language=nl |trans-title=Rooting in the global city |date=15 January 2004 |author=Joost Panhuysen |work=Tu Delta |publisher=Technishe Universiteit Delft |access-date=30 November 2012}}</ref>

She is married to sociologist [[Richard Sennett]]. Artist Hilary Koob-Sassen is her son from her first marriage.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|last2=Koob-Sassen|first2=Hilary|title=A monster crawls into the city - an urban fairytale by Saskia Sassen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/23/monster-city-urban-fairytale-saskia-sassen|access-date=1 February 2016|work=The Guardian|date=December 23, 2015}}</ref>

==Education==
From 1966, Sassen spent a year each at the [[University of Poitiers|Université de Poitiers]], France, the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Università degli Studi di Roma]], and the [[University of Buenos Aires]], for studies in [[philosophy]] and [[political science]]. From 1969, Sassen studied sociology and economics at the [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Indiana]], where she obtained a [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1971 and a [[Ph.D.]] degree in 1974, under the direction of Fabio Dasilva. She also received a master's degree in philosophy from the [[University of Poitiers]] in 1974.

==Academic posts==
After being a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for International Affairs at [[Harvard University]], Sassen held various academic positions in and outside the US, such as the Ralph Lewis Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Chicago]]. She is currently Robert S. Lynd Professor of Sociology at [[Columbia University]] and Centennial Visiting Professor of Political Economy in the [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/sociology/ Department of Sociology] at the [[London School of Economics]].

During the 1980s and 1990s, Sassen emerged as a prolific author in [[urban sociology]]. She studied the impacts of [[globalisation]] such as [[economic restructuring]], and how the movements of labour and capital influence urban life. She also studied the influence of communication technology on governance. Sassen observed how [[nation state]]s begin to lose power to control these developments, and she studied increasing general [[transnationalism]], including transnational [[human migration]]. She identified and described the phenomenon of the ''global city''. Her 1991 book bearing this title made her a widely quoted author on globalisation. An updated edition of her book was published in 2001. In the early 2000s, Sassen focused on immigration and globalization, with her "denationalization" and "transnationalism" projects (see Bibliography and External Links, below). Her books have been translated into 21 languages.<ref>[http://cgt.columbia.edu/about/committee/sassen_saskia/ Columbia University Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421160129/http://cgt.columbia.edu/about/committee/sassen_saskia |date=2009-04-21 }}, retrieved 17 May 2013</ref>
