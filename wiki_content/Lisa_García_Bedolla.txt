In 2005, García Bedolla published the book ''Fluid Borders: Latino Power, Identity, and Politics in Los Angeles''. In this book, García Bedolla analyzed evidence from "over a hundred semi-structured interviews of students in the predominantly Latino neighborhoods of East Los Angeles and Montebello, California" on topics like identity, political engagement, and the [[1994 California Proposition 187]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Price |first=Melanye T. |title=Book Review of Fluid Borders: Latino Power, Identity, and Politics in Los Angeles by Lisa Garcia Bedolla |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=96–8 |date=21 September 2006}}</ref> This was reviewed as being one of the first academic works to move beyond simple heuristics or stereotypes about Latino political behaviour and instead develop a complex theoretical framework for understanding Latino politics.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rodriguez |first=Victor M. |title=Book Review: Fluid Borders: Latino Power, Identity and Politics in Los Angeles and Latino Political Power |journal=Latino Studies |number=5 |pages=137–141 |year=2007|doi=10.1057/palgrave.lst.8600233 |s2cid=143767101 }}</ref>

García Bedolla coauthored the 2012 book ''Mobilizing Inclusion: Transforming the Electorate through Get-Out-the-Vote Campaigns'' with [[Melissa R. Michelson]]. They present 250 randomized experiments, conducted from 2006 to 2008, to understand what works in mobilizing Latino voters, in the context of low rates of voter participation by several minority groups in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Heath |title=Book review of Mobilizing Inclusion: Transforming the Electorate through Get-Out-the-Vote Campaigns |journal=The Journal of Politics |volume=75 |number=3 |date=July 2013|doi=10.1017/S002238161300114X }}</ref> García Bedolla's fourth book is written with Taylor N.
