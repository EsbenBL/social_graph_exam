==Education and career==

John Rust was born in [[Wisconsin]] on May 23, 1955. He graduated from
Waukesha High School in 1973, completed B.A. in Mathematics in 1977 at the 
[[University of Pennsylvania]], and received his Ph.D. in Economics from
[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1983.
His dissertation titled “Stationary Equilibrium in a Market for Durable Assets” 
under the supervision of [[Daniel McFadden]] was published as ''[[Econometrica]]'' article in 1985.<ref>

After graduating from University of Pennsylvania in 1977, John 
Rust worked as research analyst for [[Morgan Stanley]] in New York City for two years.
His first academic job was at the [[University of Wisconsin]] (assistant professor, 1983-1987, 
associate professor, 1987-1989, and full professor, 1990-1996), after which he had professorial
positions at [[Yale University]] (1996-2001) and [[University of Maryland]] (2001-2011) before 
starting his current affiliation with [[Georgetown University]].<ref>
{{cite web|url= https://editorialexpress.com/jrust/vita.pdf |title=Curriculum vitae }}
</ref>

John Rust had been affiliated with a number of governmental bodies, including
[[Board of Governors]], [[Federal Reserve System]] (research consultant, 1995),
Panel of Expert Reviewers of [[Social Security Administration]]’s MINT Model (member, 1998-1999),
Technical Panel of [[Social Security Advisory Board]] (member, 1998-1999),
Long Term Modeling Advisory Group U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]] (member, 2001-2004),
[[Social Security Administration]] (advisor for demonstration project resulting 
from the 1999 [[List of Social Security legislation (United States)|Work Incentives Improvement Act]], 2000-2003).
He has also been a member of Steering Committee of the [[Health and Retirement Study]] at 
[[University of Michigan]] (2000-2002),
senior advisor at [[Brattle Group|The Brattle Group]] (since 2004) and

==Research and contributions==
===Dynamic discrete choice models===
{{further|Dynamic discrete choice}}

Rust is best known for developing methods for analyzing [[dynamic discrete choice]]. In his best-known paper, he modeled the decision of Harold Zurcher, superintendent of the [[Madison, Wisconsin]] Metropolitan Bus Company, whether and when to replace the [[engine]]s of [[bus]]es in his fleet, and developed the nested fixed point algorithm to [[statistical estimation|estimate]] the model using data on when the buses were replaced.{{sfn|Rust|1987}} This paper is one of the first dynamic stochastic models of discrete choice estimated using real data, and continues to serve as classical example of the problems of this type. The methods Rust developed have been used to study dynamic economic decisions in other contexts, including [[retirement]] and [[job|occupational choice]].<ref name="AguirregabiriaMira2010"/>

===Methodological debate===

Although John Rust is a prominent [[structural estimation|structural econometrician]],
in the ongoing debate<ref>

between adepts of the [[Structural estimation|structural]] and 
[[Methodology of econometrics|non-structural econometric approaches]],
he has expressed a balanced position.<ref>

<blockquote>
I really do not understand the widespread antipathy towards structural econometrics. I do not see any basis for the belief that the reduced form approaches adopted by statistical modelers is more justified or legitimate (or is less subjective) than the structural econometric approach adopted by economic modelers. Both types of modelers have to impose strong assumptions, and it seems all that we can say is that these models and the underlying identifying assumptions are just different.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It really isn’t productive to criticize the status quo in economics these days, nor is it productive to try to promote the virtues of structural estimation. Criticism only encourages the practitioners to rally around the flag. I think it is equally a waste of time to try to engage in salesmanship.

</ref>
John Rust brings attention to the limits of inference inherent to any econometric approach, 
and argues that collection of better data and closer cooperation between structural and the 
[[experimental economics]] will lead to more useful empirical knowledge.
<blockquote>
My main message is though there is ample room for getting far more knowledge from limited data (and even more when we have access to “big data” ) by optimally combining inductive and deductive approaches to inference and learning, it is important to recognize that there are a number of inherent limits to inference that may be insuperable. These limits were not adequately addressed in Wolpin’s book, and motivated the title of this review.
</blockquote>

John Rust holds a stronger position on the issue of disconnect between theoretical economics and econometrics
from the real world (empirical) problems.
At the "Causality in the Social Sciences Conference" held at [[Stanford University]] on December 5–6, 2014
he gave a talk titled 
"{{cite web |url= http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Rust%20Presentation.pdf |title= Mostly Useless Econometrics: Measuring the Causal Effect of Econometric Theory }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Rust%20Presentation.pdf |title= Presentation slides }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
where he pointed out that development of complicated econometric theories is rewarded disproportionally
to their practical usefulness.

===Conference Maker===

[https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/listconfs.cgi Conference Maker]
is web-based software for organizing international conferences.
Conference Maker allows a program chair (or several co-chairs) and their selected program committee 
to handle the submission process in a decentralized fashion. All members of the program committee can 
log in at any time via secure password protected accounts and can view all submissions online. 
Program committee members are assigned certain subsets of submissions (usually designated by the person making the submission, unless overwritten by program committee members) and can make accept/reject decisions by clicking a button.
There is also a simple interface for forming sessions, searching for discussants and session chairs, 
posting/updating the conference program to an automatically generated web page, 
and sending mass emails to arbitrarily selected subgroups of users.

Over 625 international conferences have used Conference Maker since it was introduced in 2001, 
more than 150,000 submissions have been made to Conference Maker for these various 
conferences and over 290,000 people worldwide have used it.<ref>

<blockquote>
EJM does not attempt to fundamentally alter the decentralized “endogenous search and matching” process by which the economics job market currently operates. Since there is unrestricted entry of intermediaries similar to EJM and a number of for-profit and non-profit organizations are currently competing in this market, we discuss the problem of market fragmentation that can occur when too many organizations attempt to intermediate trade in the market. Contrary to conventional wisdom in industrial organization theory, we show that unrestricted entry and competition of intermediaries can result in suboptimal outcomes. We discuss conditions under which the market might be improved if there is sufficient coordination to promote information sharing, such as establishing a dominant information clearinghouse that operates as a non-profit public service — a role EJM is trying to fulfill.<ref>
