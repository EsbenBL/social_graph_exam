{{Anthropology}}
'''Bronisław Kasper Malinowski''' ({{IPA-pl|brɔˈɲiswaf maliˈnɔfskʲi|lang}}; 7 April 1884 – 16 May 1942) was a Polish-British{{efn|Bronisław Malinowski was born into a Polish family in a historic Polish region then administrated by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (see [[Austrian partition]] of Poland). In 1910, aged 26, he emigrated to the United Kingdom and spent most of his remaining life – some three decades – working there. After Poland regained independence in 1918, he became a Polish citizen but continued living in the U.K.<ref name=Helena/> In 1931 he also obtained British citizenship.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Thapan|first=Meenakshi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cunRBEceAp4C&q=Malinowski+citizenship+1931&pg=PA60|title=Anthropological Journeys: Reflections on Fieldwork|date=1998|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1221-4|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|60}} In his preface to a 1937 Polish-language edition of his 1929 book, ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', he wrote: "I happened to work in a foreign milieu, and served Polish learning only indirectly.

Malinowski was born in what was part of the [[Austrian partition]] of Poland, and completed his initial studies at [[Jagiellonian University]] in his birth city of [[Kraków]]. From 1910, at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), he studied exchange and economics, analysing [[Aboriginal Australia]] through ethnographic documents. In 1914 he traveled to Australia. He conducted research in the [[Trobriand Islands]] and other regions in [[New Guinea]] and [[Melanesia]] where he stayed for several years, studying [[indigenous culture]]s. 

Returning to England after [[World War I]], he published his principal work, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922), which established him as one of Europe's most important anthropologists. He took posts as lecturer and later as chair in anthropology at the LSE, attracting large numbers of students and exerting great influence on the development of British [[social anthropology]]. Over the years, he guest-lectured at several American universities; when [[World War II]] broke out, he remained in the United States, taking an appointment at [[Yale University]]. He died in 1942 and was interred in the United States. In 1967 his widow, [[Valetta Swann]], published [[A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term|his personal diary]] kept during his fieldwork in [[Melanesia]] and [[New Guinea]]. It has since been a source of controversy, because of its ethnocentric and egocentric nature.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book|last=Press|first=Stanford University|title=A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term &#124; Bronislaw Malinowski With a New Introduction by Raymond Firth|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=2891|website=www.sup.org|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804717076}}</ref>

Malinowski's ethnography of the Trobriand Islands described the complex institution of the [[Kula ring]] and became foundational for subsequent theories of reciprocity and exchange. He was also widely regarded as an eminent fieldworker, and his texts regarding anthropological [[fieldwork|field methods]] were foundational to early anthropology, popularizing the concept of [[participatory observation]]. His approach to [[social theory]] was a form of [[psychological functionalism]] that emphasised how social and cultural institutions serve basic human needs – a perspective opposed to [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]]'s [[structural functionalism]], which emphasised ways in which social institutions function in relation to society as a whole.

In June 1914 he departed London, travelling to Australia, as the first step in his expedition to [[Territory of Papua|Papua]] (in what would later become [[Papua New Guinea]]).<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|333}} The expedition was organized under the aegis of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (BAAS).<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|333}} In fact, initially Malinowski's journey to Australia was supposed to last only about half a year, as he was mainly planning on attending a conference there, and travelled there in a capacity of a secretary to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]. Shortly afterward, his situation became complicated due to the outbreak of [[World War I]] as although Polish by ethnicity, he was a subject of Austria-Hungary, which was at the state of war with the United Kingdom. Malinowski, at risk of [[internment]], nonetheless decided not to return to Europe from the British-controlled region and after intervention by a number of his colleagues, including Marett as well as [[Alfred Cort Haddon]], British authorities allowed him to stay in the Australian region and even provided him with new funding.<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|333}}<ref name=":6" />{{Rp|138}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malinowski|first=Bronislaw|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTrjsvIw2CYC&q=Malinowski++Marett+1914&pg=PA4|title=Malinowski Among the Magi: The Natives of Mailu|date=November 2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-26244-6|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|4–5}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=Jerry D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-qQX0hvoxAC&q=1922+Malinowski+doctorate&pg=PA136|title=Visions of Culture: An Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists|date=25 July 2008|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-1239-1|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|136}}

== Works ==
Except a few works from the early 1910s, all of Malinowski's research was published in English.<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|333}} His first book, ''The Family among the Australian Aborigines'', published in 1913, was based on materials he collected and wrote in the years 1909-1911. It was well-received not just by contemporary reviewers, but also by scholars generations later. In 1963, in his foreword to its new edition, [[John Arundel Barnes]] called it an epochal work, and noted how it discredited the previously held theory that [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian Aborigines]] have no institution of family.<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|333}}

Published in 1922, ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'', about the Trobriand people who live on the small [[Trobriand Islands|Kiriwana island chain]] northeast of the island of [[New Guinea]], was widely regarded as a masterpiece and significantly boosted Malinowski's reputation in the world of academia.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />{{Rp|7}}<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|72}} His later books included the ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'' (1926), ''[[Sex and Repression in Savage Society]]'' (1927), ''[[The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia]]'' (1929) and ''[[Coral Gardens and Their Magic]]'' (1935).<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|334}}

A number of his works were published posthumously: ''A Scientific Theory of Culture and Others Essays'' (1944), ''The Dynamics of Culture Change'' (1945), ''Freedom & Civilization'' (1947), and the controversial<ref name="auto" /> ''[[A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term]]'' (1967).<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|335}} 

The personal diary of Malinowski, along with several others, written in [[Polish language|Polish]],<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|335}} was discovered in his [[Yale University]] office after his death. First published in 1967, covering the period of his fieldwork in 1914–1915 and 1917–1918 in New Guinea and the Trobriand Islands, it set off a storm of controversy. The year it was published [[Clifford Geertz]] called it "gross" and "tiresome", and wrote that it portrayed Malinowski as "a crabbed, self-preoccupied, hypochondriacal narcissist, whose fellow-feeling for the people he lived with was limited in the extreme."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Christina A.|date=1 June 1995|title=Anthropology's conrad: Malinowski in the tropics and what he read|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00223349508572783|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|volume=30|issue=1|pages=53–75|doi=10.1080/00223349508572783|issn=0022-3344}}</ref> Two decades later, however, he praised it as "backstage masterpiece of anthropology, our ''[[The Double Helix]]''".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geertz|first1=Clifford|title=Works and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author|date=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|page=|author-link1=}}</ref>{{Rp|75}} Writing in 1987, [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] called it "a crucial document for the history of anthropology".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clifford|first=James|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvQXBAAAQBAJ&q=%22%22a+crucial+document+for+the+history+of+anthropology%22&pg=PA97|title=The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art|date=18 May 1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-69843-7|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|97}}

Already a year after his death [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] described his influence in the field as significant if somewhat controversial, noting that to some he "was a major prophet", and that "no anthropologist has ever had so wide a popular audience".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kluckhohn|first=Clyde|date=1943|title=Bronislaw Malinowski 1884-1942|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/535603|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=56|issue=221|pages=208–219|jstor=535603|issn=0021-8715}}</ref> In 1974 {{ill|Witold Armon|pl|Witold Armon}} described many of his works as "classics".<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|335}}

=== Ethnography and fieldwork ===
Malinowski is often considered one of anthropology's most skilled ethnographers, especially because of his highly methodical and well-theorised approach to the study of social systems. He is often referred to as the first researcher to bring anthropology "[[off the verandah]]" (a phrase that is also the name of a [[André Singer (producer)|André Singer]]'s 1986 documentary about his work{{Efn|"Bronislaw Malinowski: Off the Veranda." 52 minutes.  Films Media Group, 1985.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Street|first=Alexander|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e53MxQEACAAJ&q=%22off+the+verandah%22+malinowski|title=Off the Verandah: Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942).|date=2019|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|language=en}}</ref>}}), that is, stressing the need for fieldwork enabling the researcher to experience the everyday life of his subjects along with them. Malinowski emphasised the importance of detailed [[participant observation]] and argued that anthropologists must have daily contact with their informants if they are to adequately record the "imponderabilia of everyday life" that are so important to understanding a different culture.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LR04AAAAIAAJ&q=%22off+the+verandah%22+malinowski&pg=PA10|title=Other Tribes, Other Scribes: Symbolic Anthropology in the Comparative Study of Cultures, Histories, Religions and Texts|date=1982|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-27197-4|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|10}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Diana|date=25 January 2010|title=Naturalized Methods for Jurisprudence: A Constructive Account|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2000862|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=2000862}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last1=Crabtree|first1=Andrew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyi4VeEEnBYC&q=%22off+the+verandah%22+malinowski&pg=PA22|title=Doing Design Ethnography|last2=Rouncefield|first2=Mark|last3=Tolmie|first3=Peter|date=5 March 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2726-0|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|22}}<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|last=Okely|first=Judith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0MHEAAAQBAJ&q=verandah+%22imponderabilia+of+everyday+life%22+malinowski&pg=PT74|title=Anthropological Practice: Fieldwork and the Ethnographic Method|date=15 May 2020|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-000-18055-8|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|74}} He stated that the goal of the anthropologist, or ethnographer, is "to grasp the native's point of view, his relation to life, to realize ''his'' vision of ''his'' world".<ref>''Argonauts of the Western Pacific,'' Dutton 1961 edition, p.&nbsp;25.</ref> Because of the impact of his argument, he is sometimes credited with inventing the field of [[ethnography]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Melhuus|first1=Marit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKtffW73Nt4C&q=%22invented+by+Bronislaw+Malinowski%22&pg=PP11|title=Ethnographic Practice in the Present|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|last3=Wulff|first3=Helena|date=2010|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-616-0|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|2}}

=== Functionalism and other theories ===
Malinowski has been credited with originating, or being one of the main originators, of the school of [[social anthropology]] known as functionalism.<ref name="psb" />{{Rp|335}} It has been suggested that here he has been inspired by the views of [[William James]].<ref name=":6" />{{Rp|137}} In contrast to [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|Radcliffe-Brown]]'s [[structural functionalism]], Malinowski's [[psychological functionalism]] argued that culture functioned to meet the needs of individuals rather than the needs of society as a whole. He reasoned that when the needs of individuals, who comprise society, are met, then the needs of society are met.{{Fact|date=September 2021}} To Malinowski, the feelings of people and their motives were crucial to understanding the way their society functioned:

{{quote|Besides the firm outline of tribal constitution and crystallized cultural items which form the skeleton, besides the data of daily life and ordinary behavior, which are, so to speak, its flesh and blood, there is still to be recorded the spirit—the natives' views and opinions and utterances.|''Argonauts'', p. 22.}}


Apart from fieldwork, Malinowski also challenged the claim to [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] of [[Freud]]'s theory of the [[Oedipus complex]]. He initiated a cross-cultural approach in ''[[Sex and Repression in Savage Society]]'' (1927) where he demonstrated that specific psychological complexes are not universal.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Frayser|first1=Suzanne G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&q=Malinowski+Oedipus+complex&pg=PA28|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|last2=Whitby|first2=Thomas J.|date=1995|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=978-1-56308-131-6|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|28}}


In 1920, he published his first scientific article on the Kula ring.<ref name=":6" />{{Rp|138}}<ref>{{cite journal|author=Malinowski B|year=1920|title=Kula: the Circulating Exchange of Valuables in the Archipelagoes of Eastern New Guinea|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1449522|journal=Man|volume=20|pages=97–105|doi=10.2307/2840430|jstor=2840430}}</ref> In reference to the Kula ring, Malinowski also stated:

{{quote|Yet it must be remembered that what appears to us an extensive, complicated, and yet well ordered institution is the outcome of so many doings and pursuits, carried on by savages, who have no laws or aims or charters definitely laid down. They have no knowledge of the ''total outline'' of any of their social structure. They know their own motives, know the purpose of individual actions and the rules which apply to them, but how, out of these, the whole collective institution shapes, this is beyond their mental range. Not even the most intelligent native has any clear idea of the Kula as a big, organised social construction, still less of its sociological function and implications...The integration of all the details observed, the achievement of a sociological synthesis of all the various, relevant symptoms, is the task of the Ethnographer... the Ethnographer has to ''construct'' the picture of the big institution, very much as the physicist constructs his theory from the experimental data, which always have been within reach of everybody, but needed a consistent interpretation.<ref>''Argonauts of the Western Pacific,'' Dutton 1961 edition, p.&nbsp;83-84.</ref>}}

In these two passages, Malinowski anticipated the distinction between description and analysis, and between the views of actors and analysts.

Malinowski likewise influenced the course of African history, serving as an academic mentor to [[Jomo Kenyatta]], the father and first president of modern-day [[Kenya]]. Malinowski also wrote the introduction to ''Facing Mount Kenya'', Kenyatta's ethnographic study of the [[Gikuyu people|Gikuyu tribe]].
In a brief passage in his 1979 book [[Broca's Brain]], the late science populariser [[Carl Sagan]] criticised Malinowski for thinking that "he had discovered a people in the Trobriand Islands who had not worked out the connection between sexual intercourse and childbirth", arguing that it was more likely that the islanders were simply making fun of Malinowski.<ref name="Sagan1974a">{{cite book | last =Sagan| first = Carl|author-link= Carl Sagan|title= Broca's Brain: The Romance of Science| publisher = [[Hodder and Stoughton]]|year = 1979 | isbn =0-340-24424-0|pages = 79–80}}</ref> Mark Mosko wrote in 2014 that further research on Trobriand people affirmed some of Malinowski's claims about their beliefs on procreation, adding that the dogmas are tied to a complicated system of belief encapsulating magic into beliefs about human and plant procreation, but he also stated that "the preponderance of ethnographic evidence ... refutes Malinowski’s notorious claims of Islanders’ supposed “ignorance of physiological paternity”".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mosko |first1=Mark |title=Malinowski's magical puzzles |journal=HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory |date=June 2014 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–47 |doi=10.14318/hau4.1.001 |hdl=1885/58368 |s2cid=144815484 |hdl-access=free|quote=Notes ... 21.
