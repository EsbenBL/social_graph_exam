Lindbeck was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: Assar Lindbeck (in Swedish)|publisher=Official website|url=http://www.kva.se/KVA_Root/eng/contact/searchcontacts/detail.asp?PersonID=197|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}</ref> the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40112|title=Gruppe 8: Samfunnsfag (herunder sosiologi, statsvitenskap og økonomi)|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> and previously chaired the Academy's{{clarify|date=December 2018}} prize committee for the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. He was the first Swede to be appointed a foreign Honorary Member of the American Economic Association, and one of only three Swedes ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/honors-awards/foreign-honorary-members |title=American Economic Association |publisher=Aeaweb.org |date= |accessdate=2017-10-22}}</ref>

Lindbeck has done research on unemployment (e.g. the [[insider-outsider theory of employment]]), the welfare state (including the effect of changing social norms), and China's reformed economy. Lindbeck received a [[Ph.D.]] from Stockholm University in 1963 with the doctoral thesis ''A study in monetary analysis''.<ref name="Lindbeck1963">{{cite book|author=Assar Lindbeck|title=A Study in Monetary Analysis|url=https://archive.org/details/studyinmonetarya0000lind|url-access=registration|year=1963|publisher=Almqvist & Wiksell}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/8071961|title=Libris database|accessdate=28 August 2020}}</ref>

Assar Lindbeck also has a theory on self-destructive welfare state dynamics, in which the welfare system erodes norms relating to work and responsibility: change in the [[work ethic]] is related to a rising dependence on welfare state institutions. It was on the basis of this viewpoint that he promoted the economic theories of conservative American theorist [[James McGill Buchanan]]. Indeed, it is said that it was through Lindbeck's influence at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that Buchanan was awarded the 1986 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, a decision which was criticized by the British writer and columnist [[George Monbiot]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=A despot in disguise: one man's mission to rip up democracy|work=The Guardian|author=George Monbiot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/19/despot-disguise-democracy-james-mcgill-buchanan-totalitarian-capitalism|date=July 20, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}</ref>

Lindbeck previously headed the [[Institute for International Economic Studies]] at [[Stockholm University]], [[Sweden]]. In 1992–1993 he headed the so-called "Lindbeck Commission", which was appointed by the [[Government of Sweden]] to propose reforms in light of the then-ongoing economic crisis. 

Lindbeck has criticized the Swedish rent control system since the 1960s. This has resulted in one of his most famous quotes: “In many cases rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city—except for bombing.”<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rent Control|url=https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentControl.html|access-date=2020-07-18|website=Econlib|language=en-US}}</ref>
