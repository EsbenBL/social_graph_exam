==Early life==

Floyd M. Riddick was born in [[Trotville, North Carolina]] in an agrarian area. His father was a farmer and merchant who did not finish [[primary school]]. Floyd Riddick's ancestor, Lemuel Riddick, was one of the signers of the [[Stamp Act]] passed by the [[House of Burgesses]] of [[Virginia]]. Riddick's family lived in a village, [[Gatesville, North Carolina]]. After his father became ill, in 1928, Riddick moved to [[Suffolk, Virginia]]. After finishing high school, Floyd M. Riddick attended [[Duke University]] and received the [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. He was originally majoring in pre-law but then switched his major to [[political science]] after a talk with an influential professor, Robert Rankin. He then received a [[Masters Degree]] at [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1932, and returned to Duke to receive his [[Ph.D.]] in political science in 1935. While researching his [[doctoral dissertation]], he spent a year observing the workings of the [[United States House of Representatives]], a study which he eventually expanded and published as ''Congressional Procedure'' in 1941.
