She served as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) for the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]]{{efn|The South West England electoral region includes the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].}} from 2014 to 2020. From 2012, until her election as an MEP, she was Professor of Strategy and Sustainability at the [[University of Roehampton]].{{efn|According to her declaration of member's interests, Scott Cato retained her title of Professor after her election as MEP.<ref name="Declaration 2014" />}} Scott Cato speaks for the Green Party on finance<ref name="Green Party profile" /> and the EU,<ref name="Green Party EU spokesperson" /> and is known for her work in the field of [[co-operative studies]].<ref name="RSA - profile" /> She has published on [[green economics]], [[localism (politics)|localism]] and [[anti-capitalism]], and has contributed to works on the risks of [[nuclear power]], the use of which she strongly opposes.

==Early life and education==
Molly Scott Cato was born on 21 May 1963<ref name="EP - history" /> and was educated at [[Bath High School for Girls]],<ref name="google+" /> before reading [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].<ref name=McInerney2019-11-30 />
After working in the publishing industry, in 2001<ref name="GE - Home" /> she earned her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth (now [[Aberystwyth University]]) with a thesis on employment policy in the South Wales Valleys,<ref name="Green Party profile" /> including research into the [[Tower Colliery]] workers' co-operative.<ref name="CICS - Staff" /> Her book, [[#CITEREFScott_Cato2004|''The Pit and the Pendulum'']], is based on this research. She holds an MSc in advanced social research methods from the [[Open University]].<ref name="This is Wiltshire" />

==Academic career==
After working for the [[Oxford University Press]] from 1987 to 1998, Scott Cato tutored at [[Aberystwyth University]] in 2000, then, from 2001 to 2012, was [[Senior lecturer]] and [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in [[green economics]] at [[Cardiff Metropolitan University]] (known for most of that period as the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, or UWIC for short). In 2007 she was appointed Director of the Cardiff Institute for Co-operative Studies.<ref name="CICS - Staff" /> In 2012 she became [[Professor (highest academic rank)|Professor]] of Strategy and Sustainability at the [[University of Roehampton]].<ref name="Roehampton - profile" />

Scott Cato's academic work covers three main areas: firstly the [[green economy]], that is, one which recognises planetary limits and achieves [[social justice]]; secondly the [[economics of co-operatives]] and [[social enterprise]]s, and finally critical analysis of the existing monetary system, and alternatives which might replace it.<ref name="RSA - profile" />

=== Publications ===
She has published widely on [[green economics]], [[Localism (politics)|localism]] and [[anti-capitalism]]. She wrote ''[[#CITEREFScott_Cato1996|Seven Myths About Work]]'' in 1996, updating it in 2002 under the title ''[[#CITEREFScott_Cato2002|Arbeit Macht Frei and Other Lies about Work]]''. She co-edited ''[[#CITEREFScott_CatoKennett1999|Green Economics: Beyond Supply and Demand to Meeting People's Needs]]'' in 1999 with Miriam Kennet. Her report, co-authored with [[Christopher Busby]] and Richard Bramhall, on the structure of government specialist science advice committees, ''[[#CITEREFScott_CatoBusbyBramhall2002|I Don't Know Much About Science]]'', apparently "influenced the structure of the government's new committee examining the effects of low-level radiation".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2009 she published ''[[#CITEREFScott_Cato2009|Green Economics: An Introduction to Theory, Policy and Practice]]'', where she argues that society should be embedded within the ecosystem, and that markets and economies are social structures that should respond to social and environmental priorities. She includes examples of effective green policies that are already being implemented across the world policy prescriptions for issues including climate change, localization, [[Basic income|citizens' income]], economic measurement, ecotaxes and trade. In his review of the book in the ''[[Journal of Economic Geography]]'' [[Danny Dorling]] called it "a serious book written by the grown-up version of the kinds of people who are currently invading airports, chaining themselves to those coal trucks on the way to power stations and populating climate camps".<ref name="Dorling 2014" />

Her 2011 book ''[[#CITEREFScott_Cato2011|Environment and Economy]]'' describes the main academic responses to the need to resolve the tension between economy and environment: [[environmental economics]], ecological economics, green economics, and anti-capitalist economics. It covers topics including an introduction to economic instruments such as taxes and regulation; pollution and resource depletion; growth; globalization vs. localization and climate change.

 | quote = I have a longstanding concern for the Palestinian people, dating back to a spell spent on the West Bank teaching when I was a student. I have also introduced a motion to our conference calling on the party to organise a campaign to boycott Israeli produce and this is the strictest of my personal shopping boycotts.{{Pb}}The issue of Palestine is obviously vital to the Palestinian people but it is also obvious that the festering injustice in that region is feeding global insecurity. As a Quaker I am committed to seeking out the causes of war and the situation in Israel-Palestine seems to me the most glaring contemporary example.
