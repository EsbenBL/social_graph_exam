'''John Forbes Nash Jr.''' (June 13, 1928&nbsp;– May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to [[differential geometry]], [[game theory]], and the study of [[partial differential equation]]s.<ref>{{cite news |author=Goode, Erica |title=John F.

His theories are widely used in economics. Serving as a [[Princeton University Department of Mathematics|senior research mathematician]] at [[Princeton University]] during the later part of his life, he shared the 1994 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] with game theorists [[Reinhard Selten]] and [[John Harsanyi]]. In 2015, he also shared the [[Abel Prize]] with [[Louis Nirenberg]] for his work on [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] partial differential equations. John Nash is the only person to be awarded both the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and the Abel Prize.

In 1959, Nash began showing clear signs of mental illness, and spent several years at [[psychiatric hospital]]s being treated for [[schizophrenia]]. After 1970, his condition slowly improved, allowing him to return to academic work by the mid-1980s.<ref name="Nasar1994" /> His struggles with his illness and his recovery became the basis for [[Sylvia Nasar]]'s biographical book, ''[[A Beautiful Mind (book)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' in 1998, as well as a [[A Beautiful Mind (film)|film of the same name]] directed by [[Ron Howard]], in which Nash was portrayed by actor [[Russell Crowe]].<ref name="Oscar race scrutinizes">{{cite news |title=Oscar race scrutinizes movies based on true stories |work=[[USA Today]] |date=March 6, 2002 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/oscar2002/2002-03-06-true-stories.htm |access-date=January 22, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/oscar2002/2002-03-24-winners.htm |title=Academy Award Winners |work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=August 30, 2008 |date=March 25, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Yuhas |first=Daisy |title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained A Challenge (Timeline) |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge/ |work=[[Scientific American Mind]] |access-date=March 2, 2013}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
John Forbes Nash Jr. was born on June 13, 1928, in [[Bluefield, West Virginia]]. His father and namesake, John Forbes Nash, was an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] for the [[American Electric Power#Appalachian Power|Appalachian Electric Power Company]]. His mother, Margaret Virginia (née Martin) Nash, had been a schoolteacher before she was married. He was baptized in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nasar |first1=Sylvia |author-link=Sylvia Nasar |title=A Beautiful Mind |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |date=1998 |isbn=0-684-81906-6 |chapter-url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/n/nasar-mind.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001205143000/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/n/nasar-mind.html |archive-date=December 5, 2000 |url-status=live |chapter=Chapter One|title-link=A Beautiful Mind (book) }}</ref> He had a younger sister, Martha (born November 16, 1930).<ref name="Nash1995"/>

Nash attended kindergarten and public school, and he learned from books provided by his parents and grandparents.<ref name="Nash1995" /> Nash's parents pursued opportunities to supplement their son's education, and arranged for him to take advanced mathematics courses at a local community college during his final year of high school. He attended [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (which later became Carnegie Mellon University) through a full benefit of the George Westinghouse Scholarship, initially majoring in [[chemical engineering]]. He switched to a [[chemistry]] major and eventually, at the advice of his teacher [[John Lighton Synge]], to mathematics.  After graduating in 1948, with both a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] and [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in mathematics, Nash accepted a scholarship to [[Princeton University]], where he pursued further [[Princeton University Department of Mathematics|graduate studies]] in mathematics and sciences .<ref name="Nash1995" />

Nash's adviser and former Carnegie professor [[Richard Duffin]] wrote a letter of recommendation for Nash's entrance to Princeton stating, "He is a mathematical genius".<ref>{{cite web |title=Nash recommendation letter |url=https://webspace.princeton.edu/users/mudd/Digitization/AC105/AC105_Nash_John_Forbes_1950.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607041209/https://webspace.princeton.edu/users/mudd/Digitization/AC105/AC105_Nash_John_Forbes_1950.pdf |archive-date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=June 5, 2015 |page=23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |editor1-first=Harold W. |editor1-last=Kuhn |editor2-first=Sylvia |editor2-last=Nasar |editor-link=Sylvia Nasar |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7238.pdf |title=The Essential John Nash |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=Introduction, xi |access-date=April 17, 2008}}</ref> Nash was also accepted at [[Harvard University]]. However, the chairman of the mathematics department at Princeton, [[Solomon Lefschetz]], offered him the [[John Stewart Kennedy|John S. Kennedy]]<!-- NOTE: not John F. Kennedy--> fellowship, convincing Nash that Princeton valued him more.<ref>[[#Nasar|Nasar (2011)]], pp. 46–7.</ref> Further, he considered Princeton more favorably because of its proximity to his family in Bluefield.<ref name="Nash1995" /> At Princeton, he began work on his equilibrium theory, later known as the [[Nash equilibrium]].<ref>Nasar (2002), pp. xvi–xix.</ref>

== Major contributions ==
[[File:John f nash 20061102 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Nash in November 2006 at a [[game theory]] conference in [[Cologne]], Germany]]

=== Game theory ===
Nash earned a PhD in 1950 with a 28-page dissertation on [[Non-cooperative game theory|non-cooperative games]].<ref name="JohnNash_PhD">{{cite web |last1=Nash |first1=John F. |author-link=John Forbes Nash Jr. |title=Non-Cooperative Games |work=PhD thesis |publisher=Princeton University |date=May 1950 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/Non-Cooperative_Games_Nash.pdf |access-date=May 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420144847/http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/Non-Cooperative_Games_Nash.pdf |archive-date=April 20, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Martin J. |last=Osborne |date=2004 |title=An Introduction to Game Theory |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoga00osbo |url-access=limited |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, England |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoga00osbo/page/n34 23] |isbn=0-19-512895-8}}</ref>

The thesis, written under the supervision of doctoral advisor [[Albert W. Tucker]], contained the definition and properties of the [[Nash equilibrium]], a crucial concept in non-cooperative games. It won Nash the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1994.

Publications authored by Nash relating to the concept are in the following papers :

=== Other mathematics ===
Nash did groundbreaking work in the area of [[real algebraic geometry]]:
* {{cite journal |last=Nash |first=John Forbes |title=Real algebraic manifolds |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |year=1952 |pages=405–21 |volume=56 |issue=3 |mr=0050928 |doi=10.2307/1969649 |jstor=1969649}} See {{cite journal |title=Proc. Internat. Congr. Math |publisher=AMS |year=1952 |pages=516–17}}

His work in mathematics includes the [[Nash embedding theorem]], which shows that every abstract [[Riemannian manifold]] can be [[isometry|isometrically]] realized as a [[submanifold]] of [[Euclidean space]]. Nash also made significant contributions to the theory of [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] [[parabolic partial differential equation]]s, and to [[singularity theory]].

[[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov]] writes about Nash's work:
{{quote|Nash was solving classical mathematical problems, difficult problems, something that nobody else was able to do, not even to imagine how to do it. ...&nbsp;But what Nash discovered in the course of his constructions of isometric embeddings is far from 'classical'&nbsp;— it is something that brings about a dramatic alteration of our understanding of the basic logic of analysis and differential geometry. Judging from the classical perspective, what Nash has achieved in his papers is as impossible as the story of his life&nbsp;... [H]is work on isometric immersions&nbsp;... opened a new world of mathematics that stretches in front of our eyes in yet unknown directions and still waits to be explored.<ref name="Nash2015">{{cite book |first1=John Forbes Jr.|last1=Nash|   first2=M. Th.|last2=Rassias | title=Open Problems in Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|location=New York City| date=2016 | pages=xi–xiii }}</ref>}}

[[John Milnor]] gives a list of 21 publications.<ref>{{cite journal | first = John | last = Milnor | author-link = John Milnor | date = 1998 | title = John Nash and "A Beautiful Mind" | url = https://www.ams.org/notices/199810/milnor.pdf| journal = Notices of the AMS | volume = 25 | issue = 10| publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|location=Providence, Rhode Island|pages = 1329–1332 }}</ref>

In the Nash biography ''A Beautiful Mind'', author [[Sylvia Nasar]] explains that Nash was working on proving [[Hilbert's nineteenth problem#Nash's theorem|Hilbert's nineteenth problem]], a theorem involving [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s when, in 1956, he suffered a severe disappointment. He learned that an Italian mathematician, [[Ennio de Giorgi]], had published a proof just months before Nash achieved his. Each took different routes to get to their solutions. The two mathematicians met each other at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] of [[New York University]] during the summer of 1956. It has been speculated that if only one had solved the problem, he would have been given the [[Fields Medal]] for the proof.<ref name="Nash1995" />

In 2011, the [[National Security Agency]] declassified letters written by Nash in the 1950s, in which he had proposed a new [[encryption]]–decryption machine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/press-releases/2012/nash-exhibit.shtml |website=[[National Security Agency]] |title=2012 Press Release – National Cryptologic Museum Opens New Exhibit on Dr. John Nash |access-date=February 25, 2012}}</ref> The letters show that Nash had anticipated many concepts of modern [[cryptography]], which are based on [[Computational hardness assumption|computational hardness]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://agtb.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/john-nashs-letter-to-the-nsa/ |title=John Nash's Letter to the NSA; Turing's Invisible Hand |access-date=February 25, 2012|date=February 17, 2012 }}</ref>

== Mental illness ==
Although Nash's [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] first began to manifest in the form of [[paranoia]], his wife later described his behavior as erratic. Nash seemed to believe that all men who wore red ties were part of a [[Communism|communist]] conspiracy against him. He mailed letters to embassies in Washington, D.C., declaring that they were establishing a government.<ref name="Nasar1994" /><ref>[[#Nasar|Nasar (2011)]], p. 251.</ref> Nash's psychological issues crossed into his professional life when he gave an [[American Mathematical Society]] lecture at [[Columbia University]] in early 1959. Originally intended to present proof of the [[Riemann hypothesis]], the lecture was incomprehensible. Colleagues in the audience immediately realized that something was wrong.<ref>{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Sabbagh |title=Dr. Riemann's Zeros |publisher=[[Atlantic Books]] |location=London, England |date=2003 |isbn=1-84354-100-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/drriemannszeros0000sabb/page/87 87–88] |url=https://archive.org/details/drriemannszeros0000sabb/page/87 }}</ref>

He was admitted to [[McLean Hospital]] in April 1959, staying through May of the same year. There, he was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. According to the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', or DSM, a person suffering from the disorder is typically dominated by relatively stable, often paranoid, fixed beliefs that are either false, over-imaginative or unrealistic, and usually accompanied by experiences of seemingly real perception of something not actually present.  Further signs are marked particularly by auditory and perceptional disturbances, a lack of motivation for life, and mild [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brown.edu/Courses/BI_278/Other/Clerkship/Didactics/Readings/Schizophrenia.pdf | title=Brown University Didactic Readings: DSM-IV Schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR #295.1–295.3, 295.90) | publisher=[[Brown University]] | location=Providence, Rhode Island|access-date=June 1, 2015 | pages=1–11}}</ref><ref name="Nasar ABM">[[#Nasar|Nasar (2011)]], p. 32.</ref>

In 1961, Nash was admitted to the [[Trenton Psychiatric Hospital|New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton]].<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Nash}}</ref> Over the next nine years, he spent periods in [[psychiatric hospital]]s, where he received both [[antipsychotic]] [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] and [[insulin shock therapy]].<ref name="Nasar ABM" /><ref name="Roger Ebert's Movie">{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2003 |publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]] |date=2002 |url=https://archive.org/details/rogerebertsmovie00roge_6 |url-access=registration |access-date=July 10, 2008 |isbn=978-0-7407-2691-0}}</ref><ref name="Gracefully Insane">{{cite book |first=Alex|last=Beam |title=Gracefully Insane: The Rise and Fall of America's Premier Mental Hospital |publisher=[[PublicAffairs]] |location=New York City|date=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2ZrduulEAwC |access-date=July 10, 2008 |isbn=978-1-58648-161-2}}</ref>

Although he sometimes took prescribed medication, Nash later wrote that he did so only under pressure. After 1970, he was never committed to a hospital again, and he refused any further medication. According to Nash, the film ''A Beautiful Mind'' inaccurately implied he was taking the new [[atypical antipsychotic]]s of the time period. He attributed the depiction to the screenwriter who was worried about the film's encouraging people with the disorder to stop taking their medication.<ref>{{cite web|first=Marika|last=Greihsel|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1994/nash-interview.html|title=John F. Nash Jr. – Interview|website=Nobel Foundation|date=September 1, 2004|access-date=November 3, 2018}}</ref>

Nash felt psychotropic drugs were overrated and that the adverse effects were not given enough consideration once someone was deemed mentally ill.<ref>{{cite web|first=John Forbes|last=Nash|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_11.html|title=PBS Interview: Medication|website=[[PBS.org]]|publisher=[[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]|date=2002}}</ref><ref>Nash, John [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_13.html "PBS Interview: Paths to Recovery"]. 2002.</ref><ref>Nash, John [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_14.html "PBS Interview: How does Recovery Happen?"] 2002.</ref> According to Sylvia Nasar, author of the book ''A Beautiful Mind,'' on which the movie was based, Nash recovered gradually with the passage of time. Encouraged by his then former wife, de Lardé, Nash lived at home and spent his time in the Princeton mathematics department where his eccentricities were accepted even when his condition was poor. De Lardé credits his [[Recovery approach|recovery]] to maintaining "a quiet life" with [[social support]].<ref name="Nasar1994" />

Nash dated the start of what he termed "mental disturbances" to the early months of 1959, when his wife was pregnant. He described a process of change "from scientific rationality of thinking into the delusional thinking characteristic of persons who are psychiatrically diagnosed as 'schizophrenic' or 'paranoid schizophrenic{{'"}}.<ref name="Nash1995">Nash, John (1995) [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1994/nash-bio.html "John F. Nash Jr. – Biographical"] from Les Prix Nobel. The Nobel Prizes 1994, Editor Tore Frängsmyr, [Nobel Foundation], Stockholm, 1952,</ref> For Nash, this included seeing himself as a messenger or having a special function of some kind, of having supporters and opponents and hidden schemers, along with a feeling of being persecuted and searching for signs representing divine revelation.<ref>Nash, John [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh//amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_12.html "PBS Interview: Delusional Thinking"]. 2002.</ref> Nash suggested his delusional thinking was related to his unhappiness, his desire to feel important and be recognized, and his characteristic way of thinking, saying, "I wouldn't have had good scientific ideas if I had thought more normally." He also said, "If I felt completely pressureless I don't think I would have gone in this pattern".<ref>Nash, John [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_05.html "PBS Interview: The Downward Spiral"] 2002.</ref> He did not draw a categorical distinction between schizophrenia and [[bipolar disorder]].{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}}<ref>Nash, John (April 10, 2005) [http://www.schizophrenia.com/sznews/archives/001617.html "Glimpsing inside a beautiful mind"]. Interview by Shane Hegarty. Schizophrenia.com.</ref> Nash reported he did not hear voices until around 1964, and later engaged in a process of consciously rejecting them.<ref>Nash, John [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_06.html "PBS Interview: Hearing voices"]. 2002.</ref> He further stated he was always taken to hospitals against his will. He only temporarily renounced his "dream-like delusional hypotheses" after being in a hospital long enough to decide he would superficially conform&nbsp;— to behave normally or to experience "enforced rationality". Only gradually on his own did he "intellectually reject" some of the "delusionally influenced" and "politically oriented" thinking as a waste of effort. By 1995, however, even though he was "thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists," he said he felt more limited.<ref name="Nash1995" /><ref name=Experiences>Nash, John [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_08.html "John Nash: My experience with mental illness"]. PBS Interview,2002.</ref>

Nash wrote in 1994:

{{quote|I spent times of the order of five to eight months in hospitals in New Jersey, always on an involuntary basis and always attempting a legal argument for release. And it did happen that when I had been long enough hospitalized that I would finally renounce my delusional hypotheses and revert to thinking of myself as a human of more conventional circumstances and return to mathematical research. In these interludes of, as it were, enforced rationality, I did succeed in doing some respectable mathematical research. Thus there came about the research for "Le problème de Cauchy pour les équations différentielles d'un fluide général"; the idea that Prof. <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Heisuke Hironaka|Heisuke]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> Hironaka called "the Nash blowing-up transformation"; and those of "Arc Structure of Singularities" and "Analyticity of Solutions of Implicit Function Problems with Analytic Data".

But after my return to the dream-like delusional hypotheses in the later 60s I became a person of delusionally influenced thinking but of relatively moderate behavior and thus tended to avoid hospitalization and the direct attention of psychiatrists.

Thus further time passed. Then gradually I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation. This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of politically oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of intellectual effort. So at the present time I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists.<ref name="Nash1995" />}}

== Recognition and later career ==
[[File:John Forbes Nash, Jr..jpg|thumb|right|Nash pictured in 2011]]
In 1978, Nash was awarded the [[John von Neumann Theory Prize]] for his discovery of non-cooperative equilibria, now called Nash Equilibria. He won the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] in 1999.

In 1994, he received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (along with [[John Harsanyi]] and [[Reinhard Selten]]) as a result of his [[game theory]] work as a Princeton graduate student.<ref>Nasar (2002), p. xiii.</ref> In the late 1980s, Nash had begun to use email to gradually link with working mathematicians who realized that he was {{em|the}} John Nash and that his new work had value. They formed part of the nucleus of a group that contacted the [[Bank of Sweden]]'s Nobel award committee and were able to vouch for Nash's mental health and ability to receive the award in recognition of his early work.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Work of John Nash in Game Theory|journal=Nobel Seminar|date=December 8, 1994|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1994/nash-lecture.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810134711/https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1994/nash-lecture.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 10, 2013|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>

Nash's later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems. Between 1945 and 1996, he published 23 scientific studies.

Nash has suggested hypotheses on mental illness. He has compared not thinking in an acceptable manner, or being "insane" and not fitting into a usual social function, to being "on [[Strike action|strike]]" from an economic point of view. He advanced views in [[evolutionary psychology]] about the value of human diversity and the potential benefits of apparently nonstandard behaviors or roles.<ref>{{cite web |last=Neubauer |first=David |date=June 1, 2007 |url=http://health.yahoo.com/experts/depression/8207/john-nash-and-a-beautiful-mind-on-strike/ |title=John Nash and a Beautiful Mind on Strike |website=Yahoo!

Nash developed work on the role of money in society. Within the framing theorem that people can be so controlled and motivated by money that they may not be able to reason rationally about it, he criticized interest groups that promote quasi-doctrines based on [[Keynesian economics]] that permit manipulative short-term inflation and [[debt]] tactics that ultimately undermine currencies. He suggested a global "industrial consumption [[price index]]" system that would support the development of more "[[ideal money]]" that people could trust rather than more unstable "bad money."

== Personal life ==
In 1951, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) hired Nash as a [[C. L. E. Moore instructor]] in the mathematics faculty. About a year later, Nash began a relationship with Eleanor Stier, a nurse he met while admitted as a patient. They had a son, John David Stier,<ref name = cs-slate-2001-12 /> but Nash left Stier when she told him of her pregnancy.<ref>Goldstein, Scott (April 10, 2005)  [https://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2005/04/10/eleanor_stier_84_brookline_nurse_had_son_with_nobel_laureate_mathematician_john_f_nash_jr/ Eleanor Stier, 84; Brookline nurse had son with Nobel laureate mathematician John F. Nash Jr.], Boston.com News.</ref> The film based on Nash's life, ''A Beautiful Mind'', was criticized during the run-up to the 2002 Oscars for omitting this aspect of his life. He was said to have abandoned her based on her social status, which he thought to have been beneath his.<ref>Sutherland, John (March 18, 2002) [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/mar/18/awardsandprizes.highereducation "Beautiful mind, lousy character"],  ''The Guardian'', March 18, 2002.</ref>

In [[Santa Monica, California]], in 1954, while in his twenties, Nash was arrested for [[indecent exposure]] in a sting operation targeting gay men.<ref>{{ cite news |title=John Nash, mathematician - obituary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11627306/John-Nash-mathematician-obituary.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=May 24, 2015 |access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> Although the charges were dropped, he was stripped of his top-secret [[security clearance]] and fired from [[RAND Corporation]], where he had worked as a consultant.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sylvia |last=Nasar |author-link=Sylvia Nasar |title=The sum of a man |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/26/biography.highereducation |quote=Contrary to widespread references to Nash's "numerous homosexual liaisons", he was not gay. While he had several emotionally intense relationships with other men when he was in his early 20s, I never interviewed anyone who claimed, much less provided evidence, that Nash ever had sex with another man. Nash was arrested in a police trap in a public lavatory in Santa Monica in 1954, at the height of the McCarthy hysteria. The military think-tank where he was a consultant, stripped him of his top-secret security clearance and fired him ... The charge – indecent exposure – was dropped. |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 25, 2002 |access-date=July 9, 2012}}</ref>

Not long after breaking up with Stier, Nash met [[Alicia Nash|Alicia Lardé Lopez-Harrison]], a naturalized U.S. citizen from El Salvador. Lardé graduated from MIT, having majored in physics.<ref name="Nash1995" /> They married in February 1957. Although Nash was an [[Atheism|atheist]], the ceremony was performed in an Episcopal church. They had a son together, John Charles Martin Nash, who earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Rutgers University]] and also suffered from [[schizophrenia]] as an adult.<ref name="Sylvia Nasar 2011 143">[[#Nasar|Nasar (2011)]], Chapter 17: Bad Boys, p. 143: "In this circle, Nash learned to make a virtue of necessity, styling himself self-consciously as a "free thinker." He announced that he was an atheist."</ref><ref>[[#Nasar|Nasar (2011)]], p. 212: "Nash, by then an atheist, balked at a Catholic ceremony. He would have been happy to get married in city hall."</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=NJ.com|first=Susan K.

In 1958, Nash earned a tenured position at MIT, and his first signs of mental illness were evident in early 1959. At this time, his wife was pregnant with their first child. He resigned his position as a member of the MIT mathematics faculty in the spring of 1959<ref name="Nash1995" /> and his wife had him admitted to [[McLean Hospital]] for treatment of [[schizophrenia]] that same year. Their son, John Charles Martin Nash, was born soon afterward. The child was not named for a year<ref name = cs-slate-2001-12 /> because his wife felt Nash should have a say in the name given to the boy. Due to the stress of dealing with his illness, Nash and Lardé divorced in 1963. After his final hospital discharge in 1970, Nash lived in Lardé's house as a boarder. This stability seemed to help him, and he learned how to consciously discard his paranoid [[delusion]]s.<ref name='david'>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/07/daily/mind-book-review.html David Goodstein, 'Mathematics to Madness, and Back'], ''The New York Times'', June 11, 1998</ref> He stopped taking psychiatric medication and was allowed by Princeton to audit classes. He continued to work on mathematics and was eventually allowed to teach again. In the 1990s, Lardé and Nash resumed their relationship, remarrying in 2001.

== Death ==
On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife died in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Monroe Township, NJ. They were on their way home from [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] after a visit to Norway, where Nash had received the [[Abel Prize]], when their taxicab driver, Tarek Girgis, lost control of the vehicle and struck a guardrail. Both passengers were ejected from the car upon impact.

== Legacy ==
At Princeton, Nash became known as "The Phantom of Fine Hall"<ref>{{cite news |last=Kwon |first=Ha Kyung |title=Nash GS '50: 'The Phantom of Fine Hall' |url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2010/12/nash-gs-50-the-phantom-of-fine-hall/ |access-date=May 6, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Daily Princetonian]] |date=December 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506091547/http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2010/12/nash-gs-50-the-phantom-of-fine-hall/ |archive-date=May 6, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (Princeton's mathematics center), a shadowy figure who would scribble arcane equations on blackboards in the middle of the night.
