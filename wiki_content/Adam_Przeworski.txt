'''Adam Przeworski''' ({{IPA-pl|pʂɛˈvɔrskʲi|lang}}; born May 5, 1940) is a Polish-American professor of [[political science]] specializing in [[comparative politics]]. He is professor at the Wilf Family Department of Politics of [[New York University]]. He is a scholar of democratic societies, theory of [[democracy]], [[social democracy]] and [[political economy]], as well as an early proponent of [[rational choice theory]] in political science.<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Adam Przeworski: Capitalism, Democracy, and Science,” pp. 456-503, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007.</ref>

== Life ==
He was born in 1940 in [[Warsaw]], Poland when the country was occupied by Nazi Germany. His parents were physicians. His father, whom he never met, was conscripted in the Polish army in 1939 and killed in the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] by Soviet troops.<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Adam Przeworski: Capitalism, Democracy, and Science,” pp. 456-503, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, pp 457-58.</ref> 

Przeworski graduated from [[Warsaw University]] in 1961 with a MA. In Warsaw, Przeworski met a Northwestern University political science professor, R. Barry Farrell. Farrell persuaded Przeworski to move to the [[United States]] to study political science. According to Przeworski, "I don’t remember if I had the smarts to ask him what political science was: I did not know what it was. But even if he had asked me if I wanted to work on a ship sailing around the world, I would have said ‘‘yes.’’ I was twenty years old, and I would have gone anywhere to do anything."<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Adam Przeworski: Capitalism, Democracy, and Science,” pp. 456-503, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, pp 459-60.</ref> 

Przeworski received his Ph.D. at [[Northwestern University]] in 1966. He taught at the [[University of Chicago]], where he was awarded with the title of ''[[Martin A. Ryerson]] Distinguished Service Professor''.<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Adam Przeworski: Capitalism, Democracy, and Science,” pp. 456-503, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, pp 457.</ref>  He also held visiting appointments in [[India]], [[Chile]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]] ([[Juan March Institute]]), and [[Switzerland]]. 

Przeworski was a member of the [[September Group]] of [[analytical Marxists]] but left the group in 1993.<ref>G. A. Cohen, ''Marx's Theory of History'', expanded edition (Oxford, 2000), p. xix.</ref> 

His uncle [[Andrzej Przeworski]] was a Polish footballer, referee and manager. Przeworski is a fan of the English football club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>Adam Przeworski "Democracy: A Never-Ending Quest." ''Annual Review of Political Science'' Vol. 19 (2016): 1-12, p. 2.</ref>

==Academic research==

Przeworski has published widely in a variety of fields. One of this early works, ''The Logic of Comparative Social Inquiry'' (1970), <ref>Adam Przeworski and Henry Teune, ''The Logic of Comparative Social Inquiry.'' New York: Wiley, 1970)</ref> is "an important influence on methodological practices in comparative politics."<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Adam Przeworski: Capitalism, Democracy, and Science,” pp. 456-503, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p. 457.</ref> 

His two books in the 1980s, ''Capitalism and Social Democracy'' (1985) and the coauthored ''Paper Stones'' (1986), turned to the question of why leftist parties "abandon socialism and adopt instead a reformist agenda within the parameters of capitalism."<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Adam Przeworski: Capitalism, Democracy, and Science,” pp. 456-503, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p. 456.</ref> 

Thereafter he wrote several works on various aspects of democracy: ''Democracy and the Market'' (1991), ''Democracy and Development'' (2000), ''Democracy and the Limits of Self-Government'' (2010), ''Why Bother with Elections?'' (2018), and ''Crises of Democracy'' (2019). Among other things, in these works on democracy Przeworski has defended a minimalist conception of democracy in which "democracy is just a system in which rulers are selected by competitive elections."<ref>Adam Przeworski, “Minimalist Conception of Democracy: A Defense,” pp. 23-55, in Ian Shapiro and Casiano Hacker-Cordón (eds.), ''Democracy’s Value'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 23.</ref>  

Przeworski also published two broad overviews of theories of the state and political economy: ''The State and the Economy Under Capitalism'' (1990) and ''States and Markets'' (2003).

===''The Logic of Comparative Social Inquiry''===

In ''The Logic of Comparative Social Inquiry'' (1970), Przeworski and Teune introduced the idea of "most similar systems" and "most different systems" designs.<ref>Adam Przeworski and Henry Teune, ''The Logic of Comparative Social Inquiry.'' New York: Wiley, 1970, Ch. 2.</ref> This book also introduced a key distinction relevant in research on measurement: the distinction between "common indicators" and "system-specific indicators."<ref>Adam Przeworski and Henry Teune, ''The Logic of Comparative Social Inquiry.'' New York: Wiley, 1970, Ch. 6.</ref> 

===''Capitalism and Social Democracy''===
In ''Capitalism and Social Democracy'' (1985), Przeworski argues that European socialist parties in the first half of the 20th century faced a sequence of electoral dilemmas. The first dilemma was whether or not to participate in bourgeois elections, when [[universal suffrage]] was progressively established in Europe. The question was whether or not participation would contribute to the struggle for [[socialism]] or strengthen the capitalist order.<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Capitalism and Social Democracy'', p. 13.</ref> According to Przeworski, most socialist parties have opted to get involved in elections, since it was a means to advance some of the interests of workers in the short run and, as references to [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]] illustrate in Przeworski's book, to move toward socialism.<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Capitalism and Social Democracy'', p. 13, 17, 30–1.</ref>

According to Przeworski, the decision to participate in bourgeois elections led to another dilemma. Given that manual workers were not the numerical majority in any European country, to win elections they had to choose whether or not to compromise their socialist principles and adopt a social democratic agenda to attract the support of allies, especially the middle class.<ref>Adam Przeworski, “Capitalism and Social Democracy”, pp. 23–9.</ref> Such compromise had major consequences for socialist parties, including the withdrawal of support of workers,<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Capitalism and Social Democracy'', p. 106.</ref> the abandoning of extra-parliamentary tactics,<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Capitalism and Social Democracy'', p. 15.</ref> and progressively the defection from socialist policies when in power.<ref>Adam Przeworski, “Capitalism and Social Democracy”, pp. 30–5.</ref>

Criticism to Przeworski's account of the dilemmas of social democratic parties have been at least twofold. First, it has been shown that numerical majority is not necessary for social democratic parties to control governments,<ref>Leif Lewin, ''Ideology and Strategy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988).</ref> which implies that social democratic parties do not necessarily need to sacrifice workers’ votes to win elections.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Desmond S. |last=King |first2=Mark |last2=Wickham-Jones |title=Social Democracy and Rational Workers |journal=British Journal of Political Science |volume=20 |issue=3 |year=1990 |pages=387–413 |jstor=193916 |doi=10.1017/s0007123400005895}}</ref> Second, [[Gøsta Esping-Andersen]] argues that Przeworski is mistaken in attempting to differentiate reformist and revolutionary policies, since "we have no accepted criteria for deciding which actions will merely reflect the status quo and which will accelerate historical transformation."<ref>Gøsta Esping-Andersen, ''Politics against Markets'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), p. 9.</ref>Esping-Andersen suggests that policies that leftist parties adopt should be compared based on how they aid the process of class unity.<ref>Gøsta Esping-Andersen, ''Politics against Markets'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), p. 10.</ref>

===''Democracy and the Market''===
In ''Democracy and the Market'' (1991),<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991.</ref> Przeworski analyzes events in Eastern Europe and Latin America, focusing on transitions to democracy and market-oriented economic reforms. Przeworski presents a minimalist view of democracy: "Democracy is a system in which parties lose elections."<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 10.</ref>. He analyzes transitions to democracy using rudimentary [[game theory]], and he emphasizes the interdependence of political and economic transformations.

===''Democracy and Development''===

In ''Democracy and Development: Political Institutions and Well-Being in the World, 1950–1990'' (2000),<ref>Adam Przeworski, with Michael E. Alvarez, Jose Antonio Cheibub, and Fernando Limongi, ''Democracy and Development: Political Institutions and Well-Being in the World, 1950–1990''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref> Przeworski provides a statistical analysis of  the causes and consequences of democracy across the globe. 

On the causes of democracy, Przeworski assesses [[Seymour Martin Lipset]]’s thesis about the impact of economic development on political regimes and finds that Lipset’s argument regarding the association between a high level of economic development and the stability of democracy is supported. However, Przeworski "challenged the view that increases in the level of development are associated with increased prospects of transitions to democracy."<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Adam Przeworski: Capitalism, Democracy, and Science,” pp. 456-503, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p 457.</ref> 

On the consequences of democracy, Przeworski argued, against authors such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]], that "democracies perform as well economically as do authoritarian regimes."<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Adam Przeworski: Capitalism, Democracy, and Science,” pp. 456-503, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics.'' Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p 457.</ref>

===''Democracy and the Limits of Self-Government''===

Przeworski argues that that democracy has historically faced four challenges: "(1) the incapacity to generate equality
in the socioeconomic realm, (2) the incapacity to make people feel that their political participation is effective, (3) the incapacity to ensure that governments do what they are supposed to do and not do what they are not mandated to do, and (4) the incapacity to balance order and noninterference."<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Democracy and the Limits of Self-Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010, pp. 1-2.</ref>

Throughout the book, Przeworski offers a sober assessment of the potential of democracy to revert these challenges. One of his central arguments is that, counter to the hope of many, "democracy does not generate more economic equality."<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Democracy and the Limits of Self-Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010, pp. 14.</ref> However, he cautions that, even though "democracy faces limits to the extent of possible economic equality, effective participation, perfect agency, and liberty", it is important (1) to recognize these limits so as to better elucidate "directions for reforms that are feasible" and (2) "not to criticize democracy for not achieving what no political arrangement can achieve" <ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Democracy and the Limits of Self-Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010, pp. 16.</ref> 

===''Why Bother with Elections?''===

In this book, Adam Przeworski addresses a classical question, why should democracy be valued? Przeworski considers that democracy is a "method of processing conflicts."<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Why Bother with Elections?''  London: Polity Press, 2018, p. 113.</ref> He poses the question in the following terms: “Are there good reasons to think that if rulers are selected through contested elections their decisions will be rational, that governments will be representative, the economy will perform well, the distribution of income will be egalitarian, and people will live in liberty and peace?"<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Why Bother with Elections?'' London: Polity Press, 2018, p. 79.</ref> And he concludes that the strongest rationale for supporting democracy is that it generates civil peace. 

His reasoning is worth quoting at length. Przeworski holds that “In the end, the miracle of democracy is that conflicting political forces obey the results of voting. People who have guns obey those without them. Incumbents risk their control of governmental offices by holding elections. Losers wait for their chance to win office. Conflicts are regulated, processed according to rules, and thus limited. This is not consensus, yet not mayhem either. Just regulated conflict; conflict without killing. Ballots are “paper stones.”<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Why Bother with Elections?'' London: Polity Press, 2018, p. 118.</ref>

===''Crises of Democracy''===

Przeworski's ''Crises of Democracy'' (2019)<ref>Adam Przeworski, ''Crises of Democracy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2019.</ref> analyzes the threats to democracy in the twenty-first century in established democracies and argues that the problems are not just of a political nature. He holds that the problems have deep economic, social, and cultural roots.
