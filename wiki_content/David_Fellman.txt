Until the 1960s, the University of Wisconsin-Madison lacked any endowed chairs. When the Vilas estate, bequeathed to the University in 1908, first became available for distribution, the first step was creation of several Vilas professorships, awarded by campus-wide competition. David Fellman was among the first group, named in 1962.<ref>UW-Madison Department Achievements Faculty Awards: [http://www.polisci.wisc.edu/deptachievements Faculty Holding Endowed Chairs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109083931/http://www.polisci.wisc.edu/deptachievements |date=2016-11-09 }}</ref> He held the chair until his retirement.
