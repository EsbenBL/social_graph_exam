'''Robert L. Heilbroner''' (March 24, 1919 â€“ January 4, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] and [[History of economic thought|historian of economic thought]]. The author of some 20 books, Heilbroner was best known for ''The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers'' (1953),  a survey of the lives and contributions of famous economists, notably [[Adam Smith]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[John Maynard Keynes]].

==Biography==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}
Heilbroner was born in 1919, in [[New York City]], to a wealthy [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] family. His father, Louis Heilbroner, was a businessman who founded the men's clothing retailer [[Weber & Heilbroner]].<ref>Canterbery, E. Ray, ''A Brief History of Economics: Artful Approaches to the Dismal Science'' (2001).</ref> Robert graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1940 with a ''[[summa cum laude]]'' degree in philosophy, government and economics. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Army]] and worked at the Office of Price Control under [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], the highly celebrated and controversial [[Institutional economics|Institutionalist economist]].

After the war, Heilbroner worked briefly as a banker and entered into academia in the 1950s as a research fellow at the [[New School for Social Research]]. During this period, he was highly influenced by the German economist [[Adolph Lowe]], who was a foremost representative of the German Historical School. In 1963, Heilbroner earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Economics from the [[New School for Social Research]], where he was subsequently appointed [[Norman Thomas]] Professor of Economics in 1971, and where he remained for more than twenty years. He mainly taught History of Economic Thought courses at the New School.

Although a highly unconventional economist, who regarded himself as more of a social theorist and "worldly philosopher" (philosopher pre-occupied with "worldly" affairs, such as economic structures), and who tended to integrate the disciplines of history, economics and philosophy, Heilbroner was nevertheless recognized by his peers as a prominent economist. He was elected Vice President of the [[American Economic Association]] in 1972.

He also came up with a way of classifying economies, as either Traditional (primarily agriculturally based, perhaps [[subsistence economy]]), Command (centrally [[planned economy]], often involving the state), [[Market economy|Market]] ([[capitalism]]), or [[Mixed economy|Mixed]].

Though an outspoken [[socialism|socialist]] for nearly his entire career, Heilbroner famously wrote in a 1989 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article prior to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]:
:Less than 75 years after it officially began, the contest between capitalism and socialism is over: capitalism has won... Capitalism organizes the material affairs of humankind more satisfactorily than socialism.<ref name="reason.com">Boaz, David (Jan 21, 2005). {{cite web|url=https://reason.com/2005/01/21/the-man-who-told-the-truth/|title=The Man Who Told the Truth|work=Reason.com}}</ref>

He further wrote in ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' in 1992 that "capitalism has been as unmistakable a success as socialism has been a failure"<ref name="reason.com">Boaz, David (Jan 21, 2005). {{cite web|url=https://reason.com/2005/01/21/the-man-who-told-the-truth/|title=The Man Who Told the Truth|work=Reason.com}}</ref> and complimented [[Milton Friedman]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]] on their insistence of the free market's superiority.<ref>North, Gary. [https://mises.org/wire/socialist-robert-heilbroners-confession-1990-mises-was-right Socialist Robert Heilbroner's Confession in 1990: "Mises Was Right."]. [[Mises Institute]].</ref> He emphasized that "democratic liberties have not yet appeared, except fleetingly, in any nation that has declared itself to be fundamentally anticapitalist."<ref name="reason.com"/> However, Heilbroner's preferred capitalist model was the highly redistributionist [[welfare state]]s of [[Scandinavia]]; he stated that his model society was "a slightly idealized [[Sweden]]."<ref>Lind, Michael (June 15, 2010). [https://www.salon.com/2010/06/15/conservatives_economics_european/ "Why do conservatives want to European-ize America?"]. ''Salon''.</ref>

Heilbroner died in 2005 in New York City at the age of 85.<ref name="nytimesobit"/>

==Family==
Robert Heilbroner had two sons, [[David_Heilbroner|David]] and Peter Heilbroner, and four grandchildren, Quentin, Katrina, Henry, and Sam.

== ''The Worldly Philosophers'' ==
Published in 1953, ''The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers'' (1953) has sold nearly four million copies, making it the second-best-selling economics text of all time (the first being [[Paul Samuelson]]'s ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', a highly popular university textbook).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Uchitelle |first1=Louis |title=Arts |url=https://nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/arts/heilbroner-economists.html |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=January 23, 1999 |quote=His 1953 book, "The Worldly Philosophers," which has sold nearly four million copies, is a "Profiles in Courage" of the great thinkers who shaped modern economics. So it is somewhat surprising to find Heilbroner increasingly critical of the economists he helped to inspire. They have missed the point, he says. . . . [T]heir models are too simplistic. They overlook factors that shape the economic and social system and in doing so forfeit the deep understanding achieved by an Adam Smith or a John Maynard Keynes, two of his worldly philosophers.}}</ref> The seventh edition of the book, published in 1999, included a new final chapter entitled "The End of Worldly Philosophy?", which included both a grim view on the current state of economics as well as a hopeful vision for a "reborn worldly philosophy" that incorporated [[social]] aspects of [[capitalism]]. Its content is:
# Introduction
# The Economic Revolution
# The Wonderful World of [[Adam Smith]]
# The Gloomy Presentiments of Parson [[Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]]
# The Dreams of the [[Utopian Socialists]]
#: about [[Robert Owen]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]
# The Inexorable System of [[Karl Marx]]
# The Victorian World and the Underworld of Economics
#: about [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]], [[Frederic Bastiat]], [[Henry George]], [[John A. Hobson]], and [[Alfred Marshall]]
# The Savage Society of [[Thorstein Veblen]]
# The Heresies of [[John Maynard Keynes]]
# The Contradictions of [[Joseph Schumpeter]]
# The End of the Worldly Philosophy?
