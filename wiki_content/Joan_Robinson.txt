'''Joan Violet Robinson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (''née'' '''Maurice'''; 31 October 1903 – 5 August 1983) was a British [[economist]] well known for her wide-ranging contributions to [[economic theory]]. She was a central figure in what became known as [[post-Keynesian economics]].

==Biography==
Before leaving to fight in the [[Second Boer War]], Joan's father, [[Frederick Barton Maurice]], married Margaret Helen Marsh, the daughter of [[Frederick Howard Marsh]], and the sister of [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]], at [[St George's, Hanover Square]].<ref>Register of Marriages for St George's, Hanover Square, January–March 1899, volume 1a, p. 618</ref> Joan Maurice was born in 1903, a year after her father's return from Africa.

During [[World War II]], Robinson worked on a few different Committees for the wartime national government. During this time, she visited the [[Soviet Union]] as well as China, gaining an interest in underdeveloped and [[developing country|developing nations]].

Robinson was a frequent visitor to [[Centre for Development Studies]] (CDS), Thiruvananthapuram, India. She was a Visiting Fellow at the Centre in the mid-1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cds.edu/research/ru/joan-robinson-endowment-fund/|title=Centre For Development Studies|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> She instituted an endowment fund to support public lectures at the Centre. She was a frequent visitor to the Centre until January 1982 and participated in all activities of the Centre and especially student seminars. Professor Robinson donated royalties of two of her books (''Selected Economic Writings'', Bombay: Oxford University Press, 1974, ''Introduction to Modern Economics'' (jointly with [[John Eatwell, Baron Eatwell|John Eatwell]]), Delhi; Tata McGraw Hill, 1974) to CDS.

Robinson also made several trips to China, reporting her observations and analyses in ''China: An Economic Perspective'' (1958), ''The Cultural Revolution in China'' (1969), and ''Economic Management in China'' (1975; 3rd edn, 1976), in which she praised the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In October 1964, Robinson also visited [[North Korea]], which was effectively a single-party Communist state, and wrote in her report "Korean Miracle" that the country's success was due to "the intense concentration of the Koreans on national pride" under [[Kim Il-sung]], "a messiah rather than a dictator."<ref name="KwonChung2012">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGKJeXLSM3EC&pg=P158|title=North Korea: Beyond Charismatic Politics|author1=Heonik Kwon|author2=Byung-Ho Chung|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-1577-1|pages=151–152}}</ref> She also stated in reference to the [[division of Korea]] that "[o]bviously, sooner or later the country must be reunited by absorbing the South into socialism."<ref name="harcourt">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7m7oj7HHsU0C&q=Joan+Robinson+%22by+absorbing+the+South+into+socialism.%22&pg=PA92|title=The Structure of Post-Keynesian Economics|last=Harcourt|first=Geoffrey Colin|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780765637017|page=92|author-link=Geoffrey Colin Harcourt|access-date=31 December 2010}}</ref> During her last decade, she became more and more pessimistic about the possibilities of reforming economic theory, as expressed, for example, in her essay "Spring Cleaning."<ref name="harcourt2">Harcourt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWuGTaNCc5MC&pg=PA169&dq=joan+robinson+china&hl=en&ei=23_hTIboJ8ToObvgkeYO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=joan%20robinson%20china p. 169].</ref>

=== Education ===
She studied economics at [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], and immediately after graduation in 1925, she married the economist [[Austin Robinson]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/11/obituaries/prof-joan-robinson-dies-at-79-cambrdige-university-economist.html|title=Prof. Joan Robinson Dies at 79; Cambrdige University Economist|last=Arenson|first=Karen W.|date=1983-08-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 1937, she became a lecturer in economics at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/women-in-economics/history-faculty|title=From the History of the Faculty|last=Administrator|date=2018-04-30|website=www.econ.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519182023/http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/women-in-economics/history-faculty|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> She joined the [[British Academy]] in 1958 and was elected a fellow of [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] in 1962. In 1965 she assumed the position of full professor and fellow of [[Girton College]]. In 1979, just four years before she died, she became the first female honorary fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saith|first=Ashwani|date=2008-11-01|title=Joan Robinson and Indian Planning: An Awkward Relationship|journal=Development and Change|language=en|volume=39|issue=6|pages=1115–1134|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.2008.00531.x|issn=1467-7660|doi-access=free}}</ref>

As a member of "the Cambridge School" of economics, Robinson contributed to the support and exposition of Keynes' [[Keynesian economics|General Theory]], writing especially on its employment implications in 1936 and 1937 (it attempted to explain employment dynamics in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]).

In 1933, her book ''The Economics of Imperfect Competition'', Robinson coined the term "[[monopsony]]," which is used to describe the buyer converse of a seller monopoly. Monopsony is commonly applied to buyers of labour, where the employer has wage setting power that allows it to exercise Pigouvian exploitation<ref>{{cite journal |title= Pigouvian Exploitation of Labor |author= Joseph Persky and Herbert Tsang |journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume= 56 |issue= 1 |pages= 52–57 |date= February 1974|jstor=1927526|doi= 10.2307/1927526 }}</ref> and pay workers less than their marginal productivity. Robinson used monopsony to describe the wage gap between women and men workers of equal productivity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rlo/696i/Monopsony_Model_Latex.pdf |title=Notes on Monopsony Model of Gender Wage Gaps |access-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203115043/http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rlo/696i/Monopsony_Model_Latex.pdf |archive-date=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1942, Robinson's ''[[An Essay on Marxian Economics]]'' famously concentrated on [[Karl Marx]] as an economist, helping to revive the debate on this aspect of his legacy.

In 1956, Robinson published her [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''The Accumulation of Capital'', which extended Keynesianism into the [[Long run and short run#Macroeconomic usages|long run]].

In 1962, she published ''Essays in the Theory of Economic Growth'', another book on [[growth theory]], which discussed [[Joan Robinson's growth model|Golden Age growth paths]]. Afterwards, she developed the Cambridge growth theory with [[Nicholas Kaldor]]. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1964.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=22 July 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613085847/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|archive-date=13 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Near the end of her life, she studied and concentrated on methodological problems in economics and tried to recover the original message of Keynes' General Theory. Between 1962 and 1980, she wrote many economics books for the general public. Robinson suggested developing an alternative to the revival of [[classical economics]].

''The Cultural Revolution in China'' is written from the perspective of trying to understand the thinking that lay behind the revolution, particularly [[Mao Zedong]]'s preoccupations. Mao is seen as aiming to recapture a revolutionary sense in a population that had known only, or had grown used to, stable Communism, so that it could "re-educate the Party" (pp.&nbsp;20, 27); to instill a realisation that the people needed the guidance of the Party and much as the other way round (p.&nbsp;20); to re-educate intellectuals who failed to see that their role in society, like that of all other groups, was to 'Serve the People' (pp.&nbsp;33, 43); and finally to secure a succession, not stage-managed by the Party hierarchy or even by Mao himself but the product of interaction between a revitalised people and a revitalised Party (p.&nbsp;26).

On the whole, the book emphasises the positive aspects of Mao's "moderate and humane" intentions (p.&nbsp;19) rather than the "violence and disorder" that broke out, we are told, "from time to time", occurrences "strongly opposed" (ibid.) to Mao's wishes. Robinson recognises and appears to endorse a revision to classical Marxism in Mao's view of the relation of base to superstructure: "On the classical view, there is one-way determination between base and superstructure but Mao shows how the superstructure may react upon the base: Ideas may become a material force" (p.&nbsp;12). She acknowledges that "Old-fashioned Marxists might regard this as a heresy, but that is scarcely reasonable" (ibid.).

In June 2019, the United States Supreme Court used Robinson's monopsony theory in its decision for ''[[Apple Inc. v. Pepper|Apple v. Pepper]]''.<ref name="npr.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/06/18/733510647/apples-buying-power-and-the-woman-who-named-it|title=Apple's Scary Buying Power And The Woman Who Named It|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref> Justice [[Brett Kavanaugh]] delivered the majority opinion, stating Apple can be sued by application developers, "on a monopsony theory."<ref name="npr.org"/>

== Achievements ==
In 1945, she was appointed to the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]' Advisory Committee on Building Research, the only economist and the only female member of that committee.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=12 May 1945|title=Advisory Committee on Building Research|journal=Nature|volume=155|issue=3941|pages=570|doi=10.1038/155570c0|s2cid=4140121|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 1948, she was appointed the first economist member of the [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]].<ref>Stephen Wilks, In the Public Interest: Competition Policy and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, p. 93</ref>

In 1949, she was invited by [[Ragnar Frisch]] to become the Vice-President of the [[Econometric Society]] but declined by saying she that could not be part of the editorial committee of a journal that she could not read.

During the 1960s, she was a major participant in the [[Cambridge capital controversy]] alongside [[Piero Sraffa]].

At least two students who studied under her have won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences]]; they are [[Amartya Sen]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/15/business/indian-wins-nobel-award-in-economics.html|title=Indian Wins Nobel Award In Economics|last=Nasar|first=Sylvia|date=1998-10-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and [[Joseph Stiglitz]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VERxDwAAQBAJ&q=joseph+stiglitz%2C+nobel%2C+joan+robinson&pg=PA172|title=A History of Economic Thought, 10th Edition|last=V|first=Lokanathan|date=2018|publisher=S.

Retrieved on 8 May 2012.</ref>

She also influenced [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] which altered his approach towards economic policies.

== Family ==
Joan's father was [[Frederick Barton Maurice]], her mother was Margaret Helen Marsh.

Joan Maurice married fellow economist [[Austin Robinson]] in 1926.<ref name="whoswho1958">{{cite book |title=Who's who 1958|publisher= Adam & Charles Black limited|place=London|date=1958}}</ref> They had two daughters.<ref name="whoswho1958" />

The distinguished London surgeon and Cambridge academic [[Frederick Howard Marsh|Howard Marsh]] was Joan Robinson's maternal grandfather.

== Recognition ==
In 2016, the Council of the University of Cambridge approved the use of Robinson's name to mark a physical feature within the [[North West Cambridge Development]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwcambridge.co.uk/building-north-west/consultation/street-naming|title=Street Naming|last=Administrator|date=2015-01-29|website=www.nwcambridge.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-03-08|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309064209/http://www.nwcambridge.co.uk/building-north-west/consultation/street-naming|archive-date=9 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
