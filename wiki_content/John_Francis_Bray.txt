{{other people|John Bray}}
'''John Francis Bray''' (26 June 1809 &ndash; 1 February 1897) was a radical, [[Chartism|chartist]], writer on socialist economics, and activist in both Britain and his native America in the 19th century. He was hailed in later life as the "[[Benjamin Franklin]]" of American labor.

== Life ==
John Bray was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], while his father was performing with a theatrical company based in the city.<ref name="Carr1940">{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=H. J.|title=John Francis Bray|journal=Economica|volume=7|issue=28|year=1940|pages=397–415|issn=00130427|doi=10.2307/2550233|jstor=2550233}}</ref> Bray's father had been born into a [[Yorkshire]] family of farmers and clothiers around [[Huddersfield]]. In 1822 they moved back to the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]], to [[Leeds]]. But their initial plans were stymied when his father died shortly after their return. Young John was then lodged with a relative and was apprenticed into the printing trade around the West Riding. He moved back to Leeds in 1832 and worked on a local paper and became involved in the working class movement in Leeds, including the [[Chartist Movement]], then growing in Leeds around [[Feargus O'Connor]]'s [[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]]. He also helped to found the [[Leeds Working Men's Association]] in 1837 and became its first treasurer. He delivered a number of lectures to the membership from which his first pamphlet ''Labour's Wrongs and Labour's Remedy''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/labourswrongsan01braygoog/page/n5|title=Labour's Wrongs and Labour's Remedy|first=John Francis|last=Bray|location=Leeds|publisher=David Green, Briggate|date=1839}}</ref> was drawn.

Following the repression of the first wave of the Chartist Movement in the wake of the abortive uprising attempts of 1839 and the economic depression of 1841-1842, Bray returned to the US in 1842 and became a printer in Detroit. He later moved to [[Pontiac, Michigan]], where he began a family and later moved from printing into farming on a nearby farm. During the 1850s and 1860s he was active in the Democratic and working class movement locally and throughout the midwest. He wrote articles and lectured around the midwest opposing a range of social ills from [[Spiritualism]] to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. He supported the [[Socialist Labor Party]] and joined the [[Knights of Labor]]. As an old man he helped to shape the politics of the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]] of the 1890s.

== Ideas and influence ==
Bray's pamphlet ''Labour's Wrongs and Labour's Remedy'' is quoted at length by [[Karl Marx]] in his 1847 attack on [[Proudhon]], ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]''. In it Marx uses him to show the unoriginality of Proudhon's [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] proposals. Indeed, Bray's economics are those that have somewhat controversially (see Noel Thompson reference) been ascribed to the [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]]. In short a belief that the
source of employers profits is an unequal exchange with employees in which the latter is not paid the full value of their labor. The remedy then is
based on creating a society of equal exchange between producers at fair value. Bray's ideas in this sense are in the tradition of [[market socialism]].

According to French Socialist [[Paul Lafargue]], who calls "Labour's Wrongs, and Labour's Remedy" "his remarkable work", Bray had called for the establishing of "equitable labour exchanges", not "as a solution of the social problem" but "only [as] a means of smoothing over the transition from the capitalist to the communist ''régime''". In this he was echoing Marx's own comments on Bray in his polemic against Proudhon almost word for word. Several were started in 1840 -- "in [[London]], [[Sheffield]], [[Leeds]] and other towns", but "after absorbing vast capital, had gone bankrupt under scandalous circumstances."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1897/09/socialism-france.htm|title=Socialism in France 1874-1896|first= Paul|last=Lafargue|date=September 1897|translator=Edward Aveling}}</ref>
