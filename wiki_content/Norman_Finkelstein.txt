'''Norman Gary Finkelstein''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|ŋ|k|əl|s|t|iː|n}}; born December 8, 1953) is an American [[political science|political scientist]], [[Activism|activist]], former professor, and author. His primary fields of research are the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and the politics of the [[Holocaust]]. He is a graduate of [[Binghamton University]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in political science at [[Princeton University]]. He has held faculty positions at [[Brooklyn College]], [[Rutgers University]], [[Hunter College]], [[New York University]], and [[DePaul University]], where he was an [[assistant professor]] from 2001 to 2007.

In 2007, after a [[Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair|highly publicized feud]] between Finkelstein and [[Alan Dershowitz]], an academic opponent, Finkelstein was denied tenure at DePaul. He was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–08 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on largely undisclosed terms.<ref name="NYT20070906">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/us/06brfs-RESIGNATIONI_BRF.html|title=Illinois: Resignation in Jewish Dispute|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=September 6, 2007|access-date=August 9, 2020}}</ref> An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure and said that outside influence played no role in the decision.<ref name=depaulJointStatement>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.depaul.edu/NewsReleases/showNews.aspx?NID=1655|title=Joint statement of Norman Finkelstein and DePaul University on their tenure controversy and its resolution.|date=September 5, 2007|publisher=DePaul University}}</ref> In 2008, he was denied entry to Israel and banned from entering the country for ten years.{{sfn|Friel|2013|p=179}}

==Biography==

=== Family ===
Norman Finkelstein was born on December 8, 1953, in [[New York City]], the son of Harry and Maryla Finkelstein, [[née]] Husyt.<ref name="Gale">{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Authors: New Revision Series|date=2008|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Cengage Gale]]|isbn=978-0-7876-9533-0|pages=127–129|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/finkelstein-norman-g-1953}}</ref> Finkelstein's parents were [[Jewish]]. His mother grew up in [[Warsaw]] and survived the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and the [[Majdanek concentration camp]].

After the war they met in a [[displaced persons camp]] in [[Linz]], Austria, and then emigrated to the United States, where his father became a factory worker and his mother a homemaker and later a bookkeeper. Finkelstein's mother was an ardent [[pacifism|pacifist]].

=== Early life and education ===

Finkelstein grew up in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], then [[Mill Basin, Brooklyn|Mill Basin]], both in [[Brooklyn, New York]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Harris|first=Ben|date=December 7, 2007|title=The Academic Exile of Norman Finkelstein -- New York Magazine - Nymag|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/41838/|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}</ref> where he attended [[James Madison High School (New York)|James Madison High School]].{{sfn|Swaim|2015}} In his memoir he recalls strongly identifying with the outrage that his mother, who witnessed the genocidal atrocities of [[World War II]], felt at the carnage the United States wrought in [[Vietnam]]. One childhood friend recalls his mother's "emotional investment in left-wing humanitarian causes as bordering on hysteria".<ref name="NYT20100210">{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/movies/11radical.html|title=Is This a Man Who Sheds Light, or Simply Sets Fires?A|work=The New York Times|date=February 10, 2010|access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref> He "internalized [her] indignation", a trait that he admits rendered him "insufferable" when talking about the [[Vietnam War]], and that imbued him with a "holier-than-thou" attitude he now regrets.<ref name=haunted/> But Finkelstein regards his absorption of his mother's outlook—the refusal to put aside a sense of moral outrage in order to get on with one's life—as a virtue.

Finkelstein completed his undergraduate studies at [[Binghamton University]] in New York in 1974, after which he studied at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in 1979 in Paris.<ref name="Gale" /> He was an ardent [[Maoism|Maoist]] from his teenage years on and was "totally devastated" by the news of the trial of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976, which led him to decide he had been misled.<ref name="TNR20150707">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Jordan Michael|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/122257/unpopular-man-norman-finkelstein-comes-out-against-bds-movement|title=An Unpopular Man|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=July 7, 2015|access-date=August 9, 2020}}</ref> He was, he says, bedridden for three weeks.<ref name="Tab20120611">{{cite news|last=Samuels|first=David|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/qa-norman-finkelstein|title=Q&A: Norman Finkelstein|work=Tablet|date=June 11, 2012|access-date=August 9, 2020}}</ref>

He received his [[Master's degree]] in political science in 1980, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in political studies from Princeton in 1988. He is a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name="Gale" /> His doctoral thesis was on [[Zionism]].

According to Finkelstein, his involvement in the Israel-Palestinian conflict began in 1982 when he and a handful of other Jews in New York protested against the [[1982 Lebanon War|Israeli invasion of Lebanon]]. He held a sign saying: "This son of survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Auschwitz, Maijdenek will not be silent: Israeli Nazis – Stop the Holocaust in Lebanon!"<ref name="od16may3">{{cite web | title=The American Jewish scholar behind Labour's 'antisemitism' scandal breaks his silence | website=openDemocracy | url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/american-jewish-scholar-behind-labour-s-antisemitism-scanda/ | access-date=October 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|9R4KV9wAnsU|title=American Radical - The Trials of Norman Finkelstein|time=7m30s}}</ref>

=== Professorship ===
[[File:Norman Finkelstein2.JPG|alt=|thumb|Finkelstein at the [[University of Leeds]], England in 2009.]]Finkelstein first taught at [[Rutgers University]] as an adjunct lecturer in international relations (1977–78), then at [[Brooklyn College]] (1988–1991), [[Hunter College]] (1992–2001), [[New York University]] (1992–2001), and [[DePaul University]] (2001–2007).<ref name="NYT20070906" /><ref name="Gale" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Finkelstein left Hunter College in 2001 "after his teaching load and salary were reduced" by the college administration.<ref name="NYT20100210" /> He has said he enjoyed teaching at Hunter and was "unceremoniously kicked out" after begging it to keep him on with just two courses a semester for $12,000 a year. Hunter set conditions that would have required him to spend four days a week teaching, which he thought unacceptable.<ref>[http://normanfinkelstein.com/2015/01/15/the-making-of-norman-finkelstein-reality-asserts-itself-58/ 'The Making of Norman Finkelstein – Reality Asserts Itself (5/8),'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115192858/http://normanfinkelstein.com/2015/01/15/the-making-of-norman-finkelstein-reality-asserts-itself-58/|date=January 15, 2015}} Norman Finkelstein.com January 15, 2015. 11:45 minutes onward.</ref> Finkelstein taught at [[Sakarya University Middle East Institute]] in Turkey in 2014–15.<ref name="TNR20150707" />

==Academic career==
Beginning with his doctoral thesis at Princeton, Finkelstein's writings have been controversial.<ref name="Gale" /> He has described himself as a  "forensic" scholar who has worked to demystify what he considers pseudo-scholarly arguments.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shatz|first=Adam|date=April 8, 1998|title=Goldhagen's Willing Executioners|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/1998/04/goldhagen-s-willing-executioners.html|access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref> He has written scathing academic reviews of several prominent writers and scholars he accuses of misrepresenting facts in order to defend Israel's policies and practices. His writings have dealt with politically charged topics such as Zionism, the demographic history of Palestine and his allegations of the existence of a [[The Holocaust Industry|"Holocaust industry"]] that exploits the memory of the Holocaust to further Israeli and financial interests.<ref name="Gale" /> He has also described himself as "an old-fashioned communist," in the sense that he "see[s] no value whatsoever in states."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bruinsma|first=Jelle|date=January 5–6, 2008|title=Are American Jews Beginning to Distance Themselves from Israel?

===On ''From Time Immemorial''===
Finkelstein's doctoral thesis examined the claims made in [[Joan Peters]]'s ''[[From Time Immemorial]]'', a best-selling book at the time. Peters's "history and defense" of Israel deals with the demographic history of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Demographic studies had tended to assert that the [[Arab]] population of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled Palestine, a 94% majority at the turn of the century, had dwindled toward parity due to massive [[Zionist]] immigration. Peters radically challenged this view by arguing that a substantial portion of the Palestinians were descended from immigrants from other Arab countries from the early 19th century onward. It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

''From Time Immemorial'' was praised by figures as varied as [[Barbara Tuchman]], [[Theodore H. White]], [[Elie Wiesel]], and [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]. [[Saul Bellow]] wrote in a jacket endorsement, "Millions of people the world over, smothered by false history and propaganda, will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the Palestinians."<ref name=blamevictim2>{{cite book|editor1-last=Said|editor1-first=Edward W.|editor2-last=Hitchens|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wELzivMr_-cC&pg=PA23|isbn=978-1-85984-340-6|location=London & New York City|publisher=Verso|year=2001}}</ref>

Finkelstein called the book a "monumental hoax".<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Dershowitz Exposed: What if a Harvard Student Did This?|author=Norman Finkelstein|url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/alan-dershowitz-exposed-what-if-a-harvard-student-did-this|publisher= www.normanfinkelstein.com|access-date=November 1, 2015}}</ref> He later opined that, while Peters's book received widespread interest and approval in the United States, a scholarly demonstration of its fraudulence and unreliability aroused little attention:

<blockquote>By the end of 1984, ''From Time Immemorial'' had...received some two hundred [favorable] notices ... in the United States. The only "false" notes in this crescendoing chorus of praise were the ''[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]'', which ran a highly critical review by Bill Farrell; the small Chicago-based newsweekly ''[[In These Times]]'', which published a condensed version of this writer's findings; and [[Alexander Cockburn]], who devoted a series of columns in ''[[The Nation]]'' exposing the hoax. ... The periodicals in which ''From Time Immemorial'' had already been favorably reviewed refused to run any critical correspondence (e.g., ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', [[Commentary (magazine)|''Commentary'']]). Periodicals that had yet to review the book rejected a manuscript on the subject as of little or no consequence (e.g., ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[Dissent (American magazine)|''Dissent'']], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''). Not a single national newspaper or columnist contacted found it newsworthy that a best-selling, effusively praised "study" of the Middle East conflict was a threadbare hoax.<ref>Finkelstein, ''Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict'', pp. 45-46</ref></blockquote>

In ''[[Understanding Power]]'', Chomsky wrote that Finkelstein sent his preliminary findings to about 30 people interested in the topic, but no one replied, except for him, and that was how they became friends:
<blockquote>I told him, yeah, I think it’s an interesting topic, but I warned him, if you follow this, you’re going to get in trouble—because you're going to expose the American intellectual community as a gang of frauds, and they are not going to like it, and they're going to destroy you. So I said: if you want to do it, go ahead, but be aware of what you're getting into. It's an important issue, it makes a big difference whether you eliminate the moral basis for driving out a population—it's preparing the basis for some real horrors—so a lot of people's lives could be at stake. But your life is at stake too, I told him, because if you pursue this, your career is going to be ruined. Well, he didn't believe me. We became very close friends after this, I didn't know him before.<ref name="chomsky2002" /></blockquote>

But Finkelstein told ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' magazine in 2012 that he had been closer to [[Carol Chomsky|Carol]], the linguist's wife.<ref name="Tab20120611" /><!-- What is the relevance of this sentence? --> According to Chomsky, the controversy surrounding Finkelstein's research caused a delay in his earning his Ph.D. at [[Princeton University]]. Chomsky wrote that Finkelstein "literally could not get the faculty to read <nowiki>[his dissertation]</nowiki>" and that Princeton eventually granted Finkelstein his [[doctorate]] only "out of embarrassment [for Princeton]" but refused to give him any further professional backing.<ref name=chomskyfate>{{cite book|author=Noam Chomsky|chapter="The Fate of an Honest Intellectual"|title=Understanding Power|publisher=The New Press|year=2002|pages=244–248|url=http://www.chomsky.info/books/power01.htm}}</ref>

[[File:NormanFinkelstein.jpg|alt=|thumb|Norman Finkelstein at Solidarity stage in 2013.|222x222px]]

In a 1996 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' review, [[William B. Quandt]] called Finkelstein's critique of ''From Time Immemorial'' a "landmark essay" that helped demonstrate Peters's "shoddy scholarship".<ref name="Quandt">{{cite journal|last=Quandt|first=William B.|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19960501fabook3954/norman-g-finkelstein/image-and-reality-of-the-israel-palestine-conflict.html|title=''Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict''|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|issue=May/June 1996|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311022646/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19960501fabook3954/norman-g-finkelstein/image-and-reality-of-the-israel-palestine-conflict.html|archive-date=March 11, 2007|quote=Along with a few other conscientious scholars, he demonstrated that Joan Peters? book ''From Time Immemorial'', which claimed that Palestinians arrived in Palestine only recently, was based on shoddy scholarship. That landmark essay is included in this collection.}}</ref> Israeli historian [[Avi Shlaim]] later praised Finkelstein's thesis, saying that it had established his credentials when he was still a doctoral student. In Shlaim's view, Finkelstein had produced an "unanswerable case" with "irrefutable evidence" that Peters's book was "preposterous and worthless".<ref name="JPS-AS">{{cite journal|last=Shlaim |first=Avi |title=AVI SHLAIM, CONFIDENTIAL PEER REVIEW OF BEYOND CHUTZPAH FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS, February 9, 2005 |journal=Journal of Palestine Studies |date=Winter 2006 |volume=XXXV |page=88 |url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/files/pdf/jps/6643.pdf |doi=10.1525/jps.2006.35.2.85 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127103855/http://palestine-studies.org/files/pdf/jps/6643.pdf |archive-date=November 27, 2010 }}</ref>

=== ''The Rise and Fall of Palestine'' ===
In 1996 Finkelstein published ''The Rise and Fall of Palestine: A Personal Account of the Intifada Years'', which chronicled his visits to the [[West Bank]] during the [[First Intifada]]. Through personal accounts, he compares the plight of the Palestinians living under occupation with the horrors of the Nazis.<ref name="hiltermann">{{cite journal|jstor=4329127|title=Review by: Joost Hiltermann|author=Joost Hiltermann}}</ref>

The book was unfavorably reviewed by [[Joost Hiltermann]], who objected to Finkelstein's "abrasiveness, righteous anger, hyperbole, distortions and unwarranted generalizations", and to his generalizations about West Bank Palestinians:
{{quote|text=Finkelstein commits the error of assuming that he saw everything there was to see during his trips to the West Bank, and that what he saw represented reality. This leads to absurd observations. He claims, for example, that "many Palestinians are fluent in English" (p. 4), that "many" homes he visited were "equipped with the latest, wide-screen, color models" of television (p. 6), and that "women wore bikinis at the beach" (p. 18). The west bank of which river did Finkelstein visit? The Hudson?<ref name="hiltermann"/>}}
Hiltermann wrote that while "there is plenty of reason to be anguished about the terrible injustice inflicted upon the Palestinian", Finkelstein's "bludgeoning" style wouldn't reach an audience beyond those already converted.<ref name="hiltermann"/>

===''The Holocaust Industry''===
{{Main|The Holocaust Industry}}
''The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering'' was published in 2000. In this work, Finkelstein argues that [[Elie Wiesel]] and others exploit the memory of the Holocaust as an "ideological weapon". Their purpose, he writes, is to enable [[Israel]], "one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, [to] cast itself as a victim state"; that is, to provide Israel "immunity to criticism".<ref>{{cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Norman|title=''The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering''|edition=(2nd ed.)|publisher=Verso|year=2003|page=xi}}</ref> He alleges "a repellent gang of plutocrats, hoodlums and hucksters" have sought enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, money that then goes to the lawyers and institutional actors involved in procuring them rather than actual [[Holocaust survivors]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Norman|title=''The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering''|edition=(2nd ed.)|publisher=Verso|year=2003|page=xiii}}</ref> In a television interview to publicize the book, he said a "handful of American Jews have effectively hijacked the Nazi Holocaust to blackmail Europe" to "divert attention from what is being done to the Palestinians".<ref name="NYT20100210" />

The book was received negatively in many quarters, with critics charging that it was poorly researched and/or allowed others to exploit it for antisemitic purposes. The German historian [[Hans Mommsen]] disparaged the first edition as "a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti-Semitic prejudices". Israeli Holocaust historian [[Israel Gutman]] called it "a lampoon, which takes a serious subject and distorts it for improper purposes. I don't even think it should be reviewed or critiqued as a legitimate book."<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Alexander|editor1-first=Edward|editor2-last=Bogdanor|editor2-first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDwrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA154|title=The Jewish Divide Over Israel: Accusers and Defenders|location=Abingdon, Oxon, London & New York City|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|orig-year=2006|page=154|isbn=9781351480499}}</ref> ''The Holocaust Industry'' was also harshly criticized by [[Brown University]] Professor [[Omer Bartov]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Bartov|first=Omer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/06/books/a-tale-of-two-holocausts.html|title=A Tale of Two Holocausts|work=The New York Times|date=August 6, 2000|access-date=August 10, 2020}}</ref> [[University of Chicago]] Professor [[Peter Novick]] and other reviewers accusing Finkelstein of selective or dubious evidence and misinterpretation of history.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Landau|first1=Ronnie|title=A grubby story?|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/22nd-july-2000/31/books|work=The Spectator|pages=30|date=July 21, 2000|quote=evidence cited seems highly selective and dubious}}</ref> At the time the book was published in Germany, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported the country was "in the grip of Holocaust madness. Finkelstein is being taken seriously. What he says corresponds with what many who do not know the facts think." In an interview, Finkelstein said, "the Holocaust is a political weapon. Germans have legitimate reasons to defend themselves against this abuse".<ref>{{cite news|last=Paterson|first=Tony|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1323166/German-outrage-at-Holocaust-book.html|title=German outrage at Holocaust book|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=February 18, 220|access-date=August 10, 2020}}</ref>

In an August 2000 interview for Swiss National Radio, Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]] said the book expressed views Hilberg held, in that he too found "detestable" the exploitation of the Holocaust by groups such as the [[World Jewish Congress]]. Asked whether Finkelstein's analysis might play into the hands of neo-Nazis for antisemitic purposes, Hilberg replied, "Well, even if they do use it in that fashion, I'm afraid that when it comes to the truth, it has to be said openly, without regard to any consequences that would be undesirable, embarrassing".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Antonini|first1=Roberto|last2=Hilberg|first2=Raul|title=Interview with Raul Hilberg |publisher=Swiss National Radio (SBC-SSR) |date=August 31, 2000 |url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&ar=202 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327144638/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&ar=202 |archive-date=March 27, 2006|quote=the methods of the World Jewish Congress and some other organizations or people allied with it in his campaign I feel are detestable.

In a review in the journal ''[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]'', [[Enzo Traverso]] called the book "polemical and violent" but also "in many ways appropriate and convincing". Traverso expressed many reservations about Finkelstein's arguments about the Swiss banks and the reaction in Europe. Traverso agreed (with Hilberg) that the allegations Finkelstein made against a number of Jewish-American institutions are probably correct. He also referred to the favorable reception Finkelstein's book received in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', calling it "welcome hyberbole". But Traverso criticized Finkelstein for ignoring the European aspect of the matter, and said Finkelstein's analysis was too simplistic and crudely materialistic. He concluded, "Finkelstein's book contains a core of truth that must be recognised, but it lends itself, due to its style and several of its main arguments, to the worst uses and instrumentalisations".<ref name="TraversoReview">{{Cite journal |last=Traverso |first=Enzo |date=July 1, 2003 |title=The Holocaust Industry.

The historian [[David Cesarani]] criticized Finkelstein for absolving Swiss banks of serious misconduct toward Holocaust survivors and depicting the banks as victims of Jewish terror based on a sentence from an important report annex. "To support this amazing argument he quotes a statement from the authoritative Report of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons that 'there was no evidence of systematic discrimination, obstruction of access, misappropriation, or violation of document retention requirements of Swiss law'.

===Criticism of Alan Dershowitz's ''The Case for Israel''===
{{Main|Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair}}
[[File:AlanDershowitz2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Finkelstein's public feud with jurist and academic [[Alan Dershowitz]] lasted for years and had a negative effect on Finkelstein's academic career|147x147px]]
Shortly after the publication of [[Alan Dershowitz]]'s book ''[[The Case for Israel]]'', Finkelstein derided it as "a collection of fraud, falsification, plagiarism, and nonsense".<ref name=Goodman>{{cite web|author=[[Amy Goodman]]|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/24/1730205&mode=thread&tid=38|title=Scholar Norman Finkelstein Calls Professor Alan Dershowitz's New Book On Israel a 'Hoax'|publisher=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=September 24, 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223112401/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F09%2F24%2F1730205&mode=thread&tid=38|archive-date=December 23, 2004}}</ref> During a debate on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Finkelstein asserted that Dershowitz lacked knowledge of specific contents of his own book. He also claimed that Dershowitz did not write the book and may not have even read it.<ref name=Goodman/>

Finkelstein said there were 20 instances, in as many pages, where Dershowitz's book cites the same sources and passages Peters used in her book, in largely the same sequence, with [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipses]] in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to his claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://normanfinkelstein.com/2003/alan-dershowitz-exposed-what-if-a-harvard-student-did-this|title=Alan Dershowitz Exposed: What if a Harvard Student Did This?|author=Norman Finkelstein|publisher=normanfinkelstein.com|access-date=November 1, 2015}}</ref> Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas.<ref name=finkelstein_pg11_ar50>{{cite web|url=http://normanfinkelstein.com/2005/the-real-issue-is-israels-human-rights-record|author=Norman G. Finkelstein|title=The Real Issue is Israel's Human Rights Record|date=August 25, 2005|publisher=normanfinkelstein.com}}</ref> Examining a copy of a proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book.{{sfn|Finkelstein|2008|p=287}} Dershowitz answered the charge in a letter to the [[University of California]]'s Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the ''smoking gun'' quotation by changing its wording (from "cite" to "copy") in his book. In public debate, he has said that if "somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether Mark Twain had said that, obviously that would be a serious charge", but insisted emphatically that he did not do that but had indeed checked the original source.<ref name=Goodman/>

Dershowitz threatened libel action over the charges in Finkelstein's book, as a consequence of which the publisher deleted the word "plagiarism" from the text before publication.<ref name=finkelstein_pg11_ar32>{{cite web|url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&ar=32 |author=Marcella Bombardieri |publisher=The Boston Globe reprinted by www.normanfinkelstein.com |date=July 9, 2005 |title=Academic fight heads to print, authorship challenge dropped from text |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327144248/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&ar=32 |archive-date=March 27, 2006 }}</ref> Finkelstein agreed to remove the suggestion that Dershowitz was not the true author of ''The Case for Israel'' because, as the publisher said, "he couldn't document that".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=508242|newspaper=The Harvard Crimson|title=Accusations Fly in Academic Feud: Harvard law prof tries to prevent publication of book about Israel|author=Daniel J.T. Schuker|date=July 7, 2005}}</ref>

Asserting that he did consult the original sources, Dershowitz said Finkelstein was simply accusing him of good scholarly practice: citing references he learned of initially from Peters's book. Dershowitz denied that he used any of Peters's ideas without citation. "Plagiarism is taking someone else's words and claiming they're your own. There are no borrowed words from anybody. There are no borrowed ideas from anybody because I fundamentally disagree with the conclusions of Peters's book."<ref>{{cite web|author=Marx, Eric|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/dershowitz-rebuts-critics-plagiarism-charges|title=Dershowitz Rebuts Critics' Plagiarism Charges|publisher=[[The Forward|The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date=October 3, 2003}}</ref> In a footnote in ''The Case for Israel'' that cites Peters's book, Dershowitz explicitly denies that he "relies" on Peters for "conclusions or data".<ref name=cockburnnation/>

In their joint interview on ''Democracy Now'', Finkelstein cited specific passages in Dershowitz's book in which a phrase that he said Peters coined was incorrectly attributed to George Orwell:

<blockquote>[Peters] coins the phrase "turnspeak"; she says she's using it as a play off of George Orwell, which as all listeners know used the phrase "Newspeak." She coined her own phrase, "turnspeak". You go to Mr. Dershowitz's book, he got so confused in his massive borrowings from Joan Peters that on two occasions—I'll cite them for those who have a copy of the book, on page 57 and on page 153—he uses the phrase "George Orwell's 'turnspeak'." "Turnspeak" is not Orwell, Mr. Dershowitz".<ref>{{cite news|title=Scholar Norman Finkelstein Calls Professor Alan Dershowitz's New Book On Israel a "Hoax"|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2003/9/24/scholar_norman_finkelstein_calls_professor_alan|work=Democracy Now!|date=September 24, 2003|access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

James O. Freedman, the former president of [[Dartmouth College]], the [[University of Iowa]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], defended Dershowitz:

<blockquote>I do not understand [Finkelstein's] charge of plagiarism against Alan Dershowitz. There is no claim that Dershowitz used the words of others without attribution. When he uses the words of others, he quotes them properly and generally cites them to the original sources (Mark Twain, Palestine Royal Commission, etc.) [Finkelstein's] complaint is that instead he should have cited them to the secondary source, in which Dershowitz may have come upon them. But as ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' emphasizes: 'Importance of attribution. With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This not only bolsters the claims of [[fair use]], it also helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism.' This is precisely what Dershowitz did.<ref name=jbooksDershowitz>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbooks.com/interviews/index/IP_Dershowitz.htm|publisher=Retrieved from JBooks.com|title=The Hazards of Making ''The Case for Israel''|author=Alan Dershowitz}}</ref></blockquote>

Responding to an article in ''[[The Nation]]'' by [[Alexander Cockburn]],<ref name=cockburnnation>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20031013/cockburn|title=Alan Dershowitz, Plagiarist|author=Alexander Cockburn|date=September 25, 2003|magazine=The Nation }} [http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn09262003.html full version available from Counterpunch.org]</ref> Dershowitz also cited ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'':

<blockquote>Cockburn's claim is that some of the quotes should not have been cited to their original sources but rather to a secondary source, where he believes I stumbled upon them. Even if he were correct that I found all these quotations in Peters's book, the preferred method of citation is to the original source, as ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' emphasizes: "With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This...helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism ... To cite a source from a secondary source ('quoted in...') is generally to be discouraged"<ref name=alandalletters>{{cite web|url=http://normanfinkelstein.com/2003/dershowitz-vs-cockburn-including-exchange-of-letters|author1=Alan Dershowitz  |author2=Alexander Cockburn |name-list-style=amp |publisher=normanfinkelstein.com|date=October 2003|title=Dershowitz vs. Cockburn (including exchange of letters)}}</ref></blockquote>

Cockburn responded:

<blockquote>Quoting ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', Dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing "the original" as opposed to the secondary source, Peters. He misrepresents Chicago here, where "the original" means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.

Now look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage ("To cite a source from a secondary source...") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled "Citations Taken from Secondary Sources." Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: "'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source ("quoted in") is generally to be discouraged, '''since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed.'''"

So Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters. Finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn't go to the originals. Plagiarism, QED, plus added time for willful distortion of the language of Chicago's guidelines, cobbling together two separate discussions.<ref name=alandalletters/></blockquote>

On Dershowitz's behalf, [[Harvard Law School]] dean [[Elena Kagan]] asked former Harvard president [[Derek Bok]] to investigate the assertion of plagiarism; Bok exonerated Dershowitz of the charge.<ref name=finkelstein_pg11_ar32/>

In April 2007, Frank Menetrez, a former Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[UCLA Law Review]]'', published an analysis of the charges Dershowitz made against Finkelstein and concluded that Dershowitz had misrepresented matters.<ref name="Menetrez2008">Frank Menetrez: "Dershowitz v.

==Controversies==
===Tenure rejection and resignation===
[[File:Depaul university.jpg|alt=|thumb|Finkelstein's tenure at DePaul University, Chicago, ended with a vote against granting him tenure. Weeks of protests ensued on campus in support of granting him a position at the university.]]
Amid considerable public debate, Dershowitz campaigned to block Finkelstein's tenure bid at [[DePaul University]].<ref name="disrupt"/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/arts/11depa.html "Outspoken Political Scientist Denied Tenure at DePaul"], ''[[New York Times]]'', June 11, 2007.</ref> His campaign began in 2004 when he sent DePaul president [[Dennis H. Holtschneider|Dennis Holtschneider]] a manuscript, "Literary McCarthyism," arguing that the university should fire Finkelstein. He also contacted DePaul political science department chair Patrick Callahan.{{sfn|Abraham|2014|p=85}} In 2005, Dershowitz announced his intent to block Finkelstein's tenure bid, saying, "I will come at my own expense, and I will document the case against Finkelstein" and "I'll demonstrate that he doesn't meet the academic standards of the Association of American Universities".{{sfn|Abraham|2014|p=86}} In October 2006, he sent members of DePaul's law and political science faculties what he called "a dossier of Norman Finkelstein's most egregious academic sins, and especially his outright lies, misquotations, and distortions" and lobbied DePaul's professors, alumni and administrators to deny Finkelstein tenure.<ref name="chron">{{cite news|last=Howard|first=Jennifer|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Harvard-Law-Professor-Works-to/122347|title=Harvard Law Professor Works to Disrupt Tenure Bid of Longtime Nemesis at DePaul U.|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=April 5, 2007|access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref> In May 2007, Dershowitz spoke at [[Northwestern University]] and claimed that Finkelstein had recently attended a Holocaust denial conference in Iran.{{sfn|Abraham|2014|p=86}}

DePaul's political science committee investigated Dershowitz's accusations against Finkelstein and concluded that they were unsubstantiated. The department subsequently invited [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Ian Lustick]], two previously uninvolved academics with expertise on the Israel–Palestinian conflict, to evaluate the academic merit of Finkelstein's work; they came to the same conclusion.<ref name="Forer">Richard Forer ''Breakthrough: Transforming Fear Into Compassion: a New Perspective on the Israel-Palestine Conflict'' [[E-book]] 2010; {{ISBN|9780615404585}}, pp. 45–46</ref>

In early 2007, DePaul's political science department voted nine to three, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Personnel Committee five to zero, to give Finkelstein tenure.{{sfn|Abraham|2014|p=82}} The three opposing faculty members subsequently filed a minority report opposing tenure, supported by the Dean of the College, Chuck Suchar.{{sfn|Abraham|2014|pp=82-83}} In leaked memos, Suchar wrote that he opposed tenure because "the personal attacks in many of Dr. Finkelstein's published books ... border on character assassination" and his attitudes threatened "some basic tenets of discourse within an academic community". He believed they were inconsistent with DePaul's "[[Congregation of the Mission|Vincentian]]" values. As examples, Suchar said that Finkelstein lacked respect for "the dignity of the individual" and for "the rights of others to hold and express different intellectual positions".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/03/finkelstein|title=Furor Over Norm Finkelstein|work=Inside Higher Education|date=April 3, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316114014/http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/03/finkelstein|archive-date=March 16, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> In June 2007, DePaul University's Board on Promotion and Tenure, with the support of Holtschneider, denied Finkelstein tenure by a 4–3 vote.{{sfn|Abraham|2014|p=82}}<ref name="depaul statement">{{cite web|url=http://sherman.depaul.edu/media/webapp/mrNews.asp?NID=1630 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070707083735/http://sherman.depaul.edu/media/webapp/mrNews.asp?NID=1630 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2007 |title=DePaul University Statement on the Tenure and Promotion Decision Concerning Professor Norman Finkelstein |publisher=DePaul University |date=June 6, 2007 }}</ref>

The Faculty Council later affirmed the professors' right to appeal, which a university lawyer said was not possible. Council President Anne Bartlett said she was "terribly concerned" correct procedure had not been followed. DePaul's faculty association considered taking no-confidence votes on administrators, including Holtschneider, because of the tenure denials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/14/1412253|title=DePaul Students, Faculty Respond to Controversial Tenure Denials|date=June 14, 2007|publisher=Democracy Now|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114145853/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F06%2F14%2F1412253|archive-date=November 14, 2007}}</ref>

In June 2007, after two weeks of protests, some DePaul students staged a [[sit-in]] and [[hunger strike]] in support of both professors. The Illinois Conference of the [[American Association of University Professors]] also sent Holtschneider a letter reading, "It is entirely illegitimate for a university to deny tenure to a professor out of fear that his published research ... might hurt a college's reputation" and that the association has "explicitly rejected [[collegiality]] as an appropriate criterion for evaluating faculty members".<ref>[http://chronicle.com/news/article/2562/student-will-begin-hunger-strike-in-support-of-depaul-professors-denied-tenure "Students Will Begin Hunger Strike in Support of DePaul Professors Denied Tenure"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', June 25, 2007.</ref>

In a statement issued upon Finkelstein's resignation in September 2007, DePaul called him "a prolific scholar and an outstanding teacher".<ref name=depaulJointStatement/> Dershowitz found the compromise and statement objectionable, saying that DePaul had "traded truth for peace" and that the claim Finkelstein "is a scholar is simply false.

===Denied entry to Israel in 2008===
[[File:Israel Batch 3 (454).JPG|alt=|thumb|Terminal 3 of [[Ben Gurion International Airport]]. Attempting to enter Israel in 2008, Finkelstein was detained at that airport for 24 hours and then deported.]]

In May 2008, Finkelstein was denied entry to Israel, according to unnamed [[Shin Bet]] security officials, because "of suspicions involving hostile elements in Lebanon" and because he "did not give a full accounting to interrogators with regard to these suspicions."{{sfn|Friel|2013|p=179}} Finkelstein had visited south Lebanon and met with Lebanese families during the [[2006 Lebanon War]].<ref name="TJP20080525">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|url=https://www.jpost.com/israel/american-israel-critic-denied-entry-to-country|title=American Israel critic denied entry to country|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=May 25, 2008|access-date=August 9, 2020}}</ref> He was banned from entering Israel for 10 years.{{sfn|Friel|2013|p=179}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Israel/Lebanon: Qana Death Toll at 28|url=https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/08/02/lebano13899.htm|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=August 1, 2006}}</ref>

Finkelstein was questioned after his arrival at [[Ben Gurion Airport]] near Tel Aviv and detained for 24 hours in a holding cell.

==Reception==
Many of Finkelstein's books critically examine other authors' books. Authors of books he has criticized include Dershowitz, [[Daniel Jonah Goldhagen]], and [[Benny Morris]]. They have in turn accused Finkelstein of grossly misrepresenting their work and quoting their books selectively. In 2007, Morris said, "Finkelstein is a notorious distorter of facts and of my work, not a serious or honest historian."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&x_outlet=118&x_article=1280|title=Norman Finkelstein, Benny Morris and '''Peace Not Apartheid'''|date=February 7, 2007|publisher=Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America}}</ref>

Hilberg has praised Finkelstein's work: "That takes a great amount of courage. His place in the whole history of writing history is assured, and that those who in the end are proven right triumph, and he will be among those who will have triumphed, albeit, it so seems, at great cost."{{sfn|Goodman|2009|p=330}} In a [[peer review]] for ''[[Beyond Chutzpah]]'', Avi Shlaim said that Finkelstein "has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious American-Jewish scholarship on the Arab-Israeli conflict." He praised Finkelstein for "all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous: erudition, originality, spark, meticulous attention to detail, intellectual integrity, courage, and formidable forensic skills."<ref name=JPS-AS/>

[[Sara Roy]] said that her shared experience with Finkelstein as a child of Holocaust survivors engaged in research on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict gave her a unique position to comment. According to Roy, Finkelstein's scholarship is "exceptional both for its brilliance and rigor. In the fields of Middle Eastern studies and political science his work is considered seminal and there is no doubt that both disciplines would be intellectually weaker without it. Norman's power and value, however, do not emanate only from his scholarship but from his character.

The Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' wrote, "[i]t is difficult to sympathize with Finkelstein's opinions and preferences, especially since he decided to support Hezbollah, meet with its fighters and visit the graves of some of its slain operatives." Still, it argued that he should not be banned from entering Israel, because "meetings with Hezbollah operatives do not in themselves constitute a security risk".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/who-s-afraid-of-finkelstein-1.246638|title=Who's afraid of Finkelstein?|author=Editorial|newspaper=Haaretz|date=May 27, 2008}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Finkelstein has been heavily criticized for many aspects of his work and public commentary. [[Daniel Goldhagen]], whose book ''Hitler's Willing Executioners'' Finkelstein criticized, claimed his scholarship has "everything to do with his burning political agenda".<ref name="goldhagen">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldhagen.com/nda0.html |title=The New Discourse of Avoidance |last=Goldhagen |first=Daniel Jonah |author-link=Daniel Jonah Goldhagen |access-date=January 11, 2008 |archive-date=December 4, 2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021204232909/http://www.goldhagen.com/nda0.html }}</ref> [[Peter Novick]], Professor of History at the [[University of Chicago]] and a historian of the Holocaust whose work Finkelstein said inspired ''The Holocaust Industry'', has strongly criticized his work, calling it "trash".<ref>Greene, Richard Allen.

Chomsky selects the target and directs Finkelstein to probe the writings in minute detail and conclude that the writer didn't actually write the work, that it is plagiarized, that it is a hoax and a fraud". Dershowitz added that Finkelstein has leveled charges against many academics, calling at least 10 "distinguished Jews 'hucksters', 'hoaxters' [''sic''], 'thieves', '[[extortionists]]', and worse."<ref name=jbooksDershowitz/> Although the feud between Finkelstein and Dershowitz received the most attention in the controversy, Finkelstein has maintained that "the real issue is Israel's human rights record."<ref name=finkelstein_pg11_ar50/>

<blockquote>It is filled with precisely the kind of shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority...

Finkelstein has accused journalist [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] of "torturing" or "being an accessory to torture of" Palestinian prisoners during his [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] service in the [[First Intifada]], based on statements in Goldberg's book ''[[Jeffrey Goldberg#Books|Prisoners]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finkelstein|first=Norman|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/10/06/jeffrey-goldberg-s-prison|title=Jeffrey Goldberg's Prison|publisher=CounterPunch.org}}</ref> Finkelstein says Goldberg admits to personally sending prisoners to the ''[[solitary confinement#Torture|zinzana]]'',<ref>Finkelstein gives the following quote from Goldberg: ''The zinzana was the size of a refrigerator box, into which three, four, five or six prisoners were shoveled. The prisoners were seated on a cold and hard plastic floor, limbs draped over limbs, and they shat in a bucket that was emptied once a day. After a few days in the box, prisoners could no longer stand unaided. (p. 109; cf. p. 114, where he describes four Palestinians locked "in a space fit, at most, for two small dogs")''</ref> which he says has been repeatedly condemned as torture in human rights reports. Goldberg called the allegation "ridiculous" and said he had "never laid a hand on anybody." Goldberg said his "principal role" was "making sure prisoners had fresh fruit."

{{quote|text=One of the most compelling exchanges in the film (you can see it in the trailer below) occurs when a teary student confronts Finkelstein for his offensive remarks about Nazis. Watching this young woman break down as she formulates her question should evoke a measure of sympathy and recognition of the sensitivities of a difficult subject. But Finkelstein turns on her, accusing her of shedding "crocodile tears". This prompts her to descend into hysterics as her sadness morphs into shock and then public humiliation. But Finkelstein is undeterred.

"I don't like to play before an audience the Holocaust card," Finkelstein begins, his voice rising. "But since now I feel compelled to, my late father was in Auschwitz concentration camp. My late mother was in Majdanek concentration camp. Every single member of my family on both sides was exterminated. Both of my parents were in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. And it is precisely and exactly because of the lessons my parents taught me and my two siblings that I will not be silent when Israel commits its crimes against the Palestinians. And I condsider [sic] nothing more descipcable [sic] than to use their suffering and their martyrdom to try to justify the torture, the brutalization, the demolition of homes that Israel daily commits against the Palestinians. So I refuse any longer to be intimidated or browbeaten by the tears. If you have any heart in you, you would be crying for the Palestinians."<ref name="jta09nov24"/>}} 
"Finkelstein comes off as sad, disturbed, strange, and pathetic," Harris writes.<ref name="jta09nov24"/> The same year, Finkelstein also appeared in ''Defamation'' (Hebrew: השמצה; translit.

===Comments about Israel===

{{See also|Criticism of Israel}}
[[File:TWIP - 2007-03-25 Interview of Professor Norman Finkelstein.vorb.oga|thumb|right|Interview of Norman Finkelstein on This Week In Palestine radio.]]
Finkelstein is a sharp critic of the state of Israel. Discussing Finkelstein's book ''Beyond Chutzpah'', Israeli historian Avi Shlaim said that Finkelstein's critique of Israel "extremely detailed, well-documented and accurate."<ref name="hilberg"/>

In a 2009 telephone interview with ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', Finkelstein said:

<blockquote>I think Israel, as a number of commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. While the rest of the world wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.<ref name="todaysk">{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/interviews_norman-finkelstein-israel-is-committing-a-holocaust-in-gaza_164483.html |title=Norman Finkelstein: Israel is committing a holocaust in Gaza |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2009-01-19 |access-date=2011-11-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202160042/http://www.todayszaman.com/interviews_norman-finkelstein-israel-is-committing-a-holocaust-in-gaza_164483.html |archive-date=December 2, 2014 }}</ref></blockquote>

When asked how he, as the son of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel's operation in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:

<blockquote>It has been a long time since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils [sic] of the hell, a satanic state.<ref name="todaysk" /></blockquote>

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has called Finkelstein an "obsessive anti-Zionist" filled with "vitriolic hatred of Zionism and Israel."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/ADL_Opinions/Holocaust/20051031-JewishStandard.htm|title=Norman Finkelstein: An Obsessive Anti-Zionist Shows his Stripes|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|access-date=November 13, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215211623/http://www.adl.org/ADL_Opinions/Holocaust/20051031-JewishStandard.htm|archive-date=December 15, 2011}}</ref> Of being called an anti-Zionist, Finkelstein has said: "It's a superficial term. I am opposed to any state with an ethnic character, not only to Israel."<ref name="normanfinkelstein.com"/>

Finkelstein believes that the main reason the conflict isn't resolved is "the refusal of Israel, backed by the United States government, to abide by international law, to abide by the opinion of the international community."<ref name="demnow"/>

=== Terrorism and targeting civilians ===
Finkelstein's views on terrorism and targeting civilians are ambiguous. In an interview with Emanuel Stoakes, he answered the question "Do you unequivocally condemn Palestinian attacks against innocent civilians?" as follows:
{{quote|text=It is impossible to justify terrorism, which is the targeting of civilians to achieve a political goal. But it's also difficult to make categorical statements of the kind you suggest. I do believe that Hezbollah has the right to target Israeli civilians if Israel persists in targeting civilians until Israel ceases its terrorist acts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://palestinechronicle.com/old/view_article_details.php?id=16783 |title=It Was a Massacre&nbsp;– Interview with Norman Finkelstein |publisher=Palestinechronicle.com |access-date=November 13, 2011 |quote=It is impossible to justify terrorism, which is the targeting of civilians to achieve a political goal.

He believes that Hamas and Hizbullah have a fundamental right to defend their countries from what he sees as Israeli aggression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1676.htm|title=In Defense of Hezbollah |publisher=Normanfinkelstein.com|access-date=October 4, 2013|quote=But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.}}</ref> Finkelstein believes that both Israel and Hamas are guilty of targeting civilians. Israel, he claims, indiscriminately kills Palestinians, which he says is the same thing as targeting civilians.<ref>{{cite web | title=Finkelstein on Hamas, current crisis, Lebanon, Hezbollah(Burlington, VT, 09.30.2006) | website=Norman G.

Once again we have quite extensive human rights reports, quite extensive documentation — the record shows that Israel has routinely targetted civilians for killing. ... So at that level, again, there seems to be, pretty much, an equivalence between the actions of Hamas and the actions of the State of Israel. It’s also true to say, and you’ll find this through out the human rights literature, that Israel indiscriminately kills Palestinians. That is to say, it fires wildly into crowds and many Palestinians get killed.}}</ref> There is an equivalence between these groups and Israel, he argues: "If Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, if you want to make that claim, I won’t argue with you so long as you say further that Israel is a terrorist organization by probably, at least, 25-fold greater."<ref name="on-hamas">{{cite web | title=Finkelstein on Hamas, current crisis, Lebanon, Hezbollah(Burlington, VT, 09.30.2006) | website=Norman G.

===Hezbollah and Hamas===
[[File:Norman Finkelstein says by Latuff2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A 2006 [[Carlos Latuff]] cartoon depicting Finkelstein's comparisons between the State of Israel and Hamas]]
Finkelstein has expressed solidarity with [[Hezbollah]] with respect to defensive actions.<ref name = "Defence of Hiz">{{cite web | title=American Political Scientist Norman Finkelstein: "Israel Has to Suffer a Defeat" | website=MEMRI | url=https://www.memri.org/tv/american-political-scientist-norman-finkelstein-israel-has-suffer-defeat | access-date=October 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name="counterpunch.org">[http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein01132009.html The Facts About Hamas and the War on Gaza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226230738/http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein01132009.html |date=December 26, 2010 }}</ref>

<blockquote>I was of course happy to meet the Hizbullah people, because it is a point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express solidarity with them, and I am not going to be a coward of [sic] a hypocrite about it. ...<ref name="Defence of Hiz"/></blockquote>

He claims Hezbullah has "a serious leadership whose commitment is matched by its intelligence and its incorruptibility" and has expressed admiration for its [[Secretary-General of Hezbollah|Secretary General]] [[Hassan Nasrallah]]. He believes that the organization through the [[2006 Israel–Hezbollah War]] demonstrated how to defeat Israel using guerilla warfare.<ref name="on-hamas"/> Hezbullah militants superior discipline gives them an edge against Israel's army, Finkelstein argues:

{{quote|text=Israel is, for better or for worse, it's a Westernized society and they don't have… they're interested in hi-tech, they're interested in a good time, they cannot fight and win against the types who embody Hezbollah values. It's just not going to happen. When they described in the newspapers how Hezbollah organizes, they said this is not an organization that you can knock on the door, can I join? No. They start from a quite young age and they learn discipline. What does discipline mean? They tell a fellow, you go over there in that barn and you wait there until we call you. And sometimes they sit in that barn for 2, 3 and 4 days, waiting to be called and until they're called, they don't leave. You know, most people in the West can't do that.<ref name="on-hamas"/>}}

Finkelstein argues that one of Israel's primary motivations for launching the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|2008 offensive in Gaza]] was that Hamas was "signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the June 1967 border." Finkelstein believes Hamas has joined the international community in "seeking a diplomatic settlement" and describes Hamas's stance towards Israel prior to the war as a "peace offensive".<ref name="counterpunch.org"/><ref name="demnow">{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/8/former_amb_martin_indyk_vs_author|title=Former Amb.

=== One-state solution, Two-state solution, and the Palestinian refugees ===

Finkelstein has said he believes that the Palestine solidarity movement should focus on a pragmatic settlement of the Israel-Palestinian conflict rather than a just one. In his view, the [[two-state solution]] is the pragmatic option and the [[one-state solution]] the idealistic one.<ref name="mw11dec23-1">{{cite web | last=Weiss | first=Philip | title=Two critiques of Norman Finkelstein – Mondoweiss | website=Mondoweiss | date=December 23, 2011 | url=https://mondoweiss.net/2011/12/two-critiques-of-norman-finkelsteins-recent-appearances/ | access-date=October 4, 2020 | quote = He stakes all of his positions on these issues, which are virtually based on the same premises, that we should a) do what is popular or ‘realistic’ b) adjust our language and positions to appeal to ‘global consensus’ for fear that c) if we don’t, we will inevitably ‘turn people off.’}}</ref> He concedes that the two-state solution is deeply unjust to the Palestinians:
{{quote|text=Of course the two-state solution is unjust. It cements Zionist usurpation of Palestinian land. It lets the perpetrators of this usurpation go scott-free, without so much as compensation for their victims. Worst of all, it perpetuates a state based on racial supremacy. Israel’s notion of Jewishness, the determinant of who should hold sovereignty, is ultimately a biological. It is based on kinship. In practice, this kinship does not, as in other countries, depend on tracing family lines back to residence in the sovereign state, but simply on closeness to anyone considered ‘Jewish’ in the racial sense of the term.<ref name="fink11dec10">{{cite web | title=Reasoned rejection of one-state position - Norman G.

But, according to him, the two-state solution is achievable and the one-state solution is not. His view of the one-state solution is "a society in which Jews and Palestinians enjoy the same democratic rights. One Jew, one vote, one Palestinian, one vote."<ref name="fink11dec10"/> This, he argues, is a society Israeli Jews will never acquiesce to because Jewish dominance cannot be guaranteed. He argues that it would be tantamount to Israel giving up "its existence, its rationale, and the security of all its Jewish citizens".<ref name="fink11dec10-1">{{cite web | title=Reasoned rejection of one-state position - Norman G.

The major human rights organizations, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch have both upheld the right of return; as a legal right, it’s there.}}</ref> But he believes that insisting on that right is unrealistic and doubts international public support could be found for it:

{{quote|text=Israel has a population of 8.3 million people. Of those 8.3 million, about 6 million are Jewish. The number of Palestinian refugees is about 6 million. Is it realistic to expect that international public opinion at the popular or State level will demand that Israel open its borders such that the number of Palestinians entering the country would be equal to the current Israeli-Jewish population? ... I don’t believe that’s a realistic expectation.<ref name="alt16nov1">{{cite web | title=Norman Finkelstein: Prospects, Hope and Strategies for the Future in Palestine | website=Alternatives International | date=November 1, 2016 | url=https://www.alterinter.org/?Norman-Finkelstein-Prospects-Hope-and-Strategies-for-the-Future-in-Palestine | access-date=October 4, 2020}}</ref>}}

Finkelstein further argues that even if a binational state comes into existence, there is no guarantee of an absence of bloodshed. He sees the [[Yugoslav Wars]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Czechoslovakia]] as showing why Jews and Palestinians sharing a state could be problematic.<ref name="fink11dec10-2">{{cite web | title=Reasoned rejection of one-state position - Norman G.

The most encouraging examples of binational states, Belgium and Czechoslovakia, are now dissolved or on the brink of dissolution. Then there is, or was, Yugoslavia. Is there such warmth between Israeli Jews and Palestinians that we may expect a better outcome there than in these countries?}}</ref>

For these reasons, Finkelstein prefers the two-state solution. He believes that, while such a solution is currently politically impossible,<ref name="alt16nov1-2">{{cite web | title=Norman Finkelstein: Prospects, Hope and Strategies for the Future in Palestine | website=Alternatives International | date=November 1, 2016 | url=https://www.alterinter.org/?Norman-Finkelstein-Prospects-Hope-and-Strategies-for-the-Future-in-Palestine | access-date=October 4, 2020 | quote = Today, the occupation for Israel is cost-free: Europe subsidizes the occupation, the Palestinian Authority polices the occupation, while the US protects Israel from any diplomatic fallout. There’s no incentive for Israel to end the occupation. What needs to change is the balance of power, which is at the moment overwhelmingly favorable to Israel.}}</ref> it could come to fruition through mutually agreed land swaps and by evacuating about half of all Israeli West Bank Settlers:
{{quote|text=Topographers and cartographers on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides say there is a way to retain a contiguous Palestinian state with land swaps so that the total area remains the same as the 1967 borders, while enabling around 60 percent of the illegal Jewish settlers to remain in place under Israeli rule. ... But it’s feasible.<ref name="alt16nov1"/>}}

Finkelstein argues that many Israeli Jews see the ongoing occupation and the West Bank settlements as problematic; that they benefit only a small segment of Israel's Jews; that they complicate security arrangements; that the occupation is expensive; and that it earns Israel near-universal opprobrium. Thus, he argues, Israel could be compelled to accept a two-state solution.<ref name="fink11dec10-3">{{cite web | title=Reasoned rejection of one-state position - Norman G.

=== The BDS movement ===
Finkelstein's opinions on the one-state solution and the right of return lay the foundation for his critique of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) movement. BDS demands three things of Israel: an end to the occupation and the removal of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|separation barrier]] in the [[West Bank]], full equality for [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel]]; and "respecting, protecting, and promoting the [[Palestinian right of return|rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties]]". It advocates international boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel to achieve these goals. Finkelstein believes that BDS's tactics are correct but not its demands.<ref>{{cite news|title=Norman Finkelstein on the Role of BDS & Why Obama Doesn't Believe His Own Words on Israel-Palestine|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/6/4/norman_finkelstein_on_the_role_of|access-date=October 12, 2014|work=Democracy Now!|publisher=Pacifica|date=June 4, 2014|quote=Who could not support Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions?

Therefore, because he believes that BDS's demands would lead to the end of Israel, international law does not support them.<ref>{{cite news|title=Norman Finkelstein on the Role of BDS & Why Obama Doesn't Believe His Own Words on Israel-Palestine|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/6/4/norman_finkelstein_on_the_role_of|access-date=October 12, 2014|work=Democracy Now!|publisher=Pacifica|date=June 4, 2014|quote=The BDS movement, it always says, and I’m using their language, “We are a rights-based organization.

Therefore, he argues, BDS is a "cult" that cannot reach the broad public: "if you want to go past that law or ignore the Israel part, you'll never reach a broad public. And then it's a cult."<ref name="dem12jun4">{{cite web | title=Norman Finkelstein on the Role of BDS & Why Obama Doesn't Believe His Own Words on Israel-Palestine | website=Democracy Now! | date=September 23, 2020 | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/6/4/norman_finkelstein_on_the_role_of | access-date=October 4, 2020}}</ref>

BDS claims to enjoy broad support in Palestinian civil society. Finkelstein claims that is a lie:<ref>{{youtube|ASIBGSSw4lI|title=Norman Finkelstein Interview with Frank Barat: BDS Campaign {{!}} Imperial College London [09-02-2012]|time=24m50s}}</ref>
{{quote|text=I'm not going to be in a cult again. I'm not going through that stage again, with the gurus in Ramallah, you know, giving out marching orders. And then if you disagree, they say, "10,556,454 Palestinian civil society organizations have endorsed this."

Who are these organizations?  They're NGOs in Ramallah, one-person operations, and they claim to represent what they call this thing, "Palestinian civil society." ...  [T]hen why can't they ever organize a demonstration of more than 500 people? ... [They] represent absolutely nothing.}}

Finkelstein believes that BDS serves the role as "a new Great Satan" to the Israeli government, an external threat "bent on Israel’s destruction" to rally around. In his view, international public opinion has begun to turn against Israel but BDS allows it "to play victim." He believes that by inflating the threat of BDS, the Israeli government delegitimizes other critics of Israel:
{{quote|text=By inflating the threat posed by BDS; and by redefining BDS to encompass all opposition to it, including European Union and church initiatives wholly divorced from BDS; and by subsuming under the rubric of BDS the campaigns in the West that only targeted the settlements and the occupation—by exaggerating the reach and potency of BDS, Israel could delegitimize even its most tepid but also most ominous critics. It could now allege that even they were really, whatever they might avow, seeking Israel’s destruction.<ref name="mw16">{{cite web | last=Weiss | first=Philip | title=Norman Finkelstein on Sanders, the first intifada, BDS, and ten years of unemployment – Mondoweiss | website=Mondoweiss | date=April 27, 2016 | url=https://mondoweiss.net/2016/04/norman-finkelstein-on-sanders-the-first-intifada-bds-and-ten-years-of-unemployment/ | access-date=October 4, 2020}}</ref>}}

Finkelstein contends that BDS has allowed Israel to "play the victim card" and shift the debate from pressing human rights concerns, such as the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|ongoing blockade of Gaza]], to the question of whether BDS is anti-Semitic. He believes that BDS has helped Israel in this effort: "But it must also be said that BDS made it very easy for Israel, by refusing to recognize its legality as a state within the pre-June 1967 borders."<ref name="mw16-1">{{cite web | last=Weiss | first=Philip | title=Norman Finkelstein on Sanders, the first intifada, BDS, and ten years of unemployment – Mondoweiss | website=Mondoweiss | date=April 27, 2016 | url=https://mondoweiss.net/2016/04/norman-finkelstein-on-sanders-the-first-intifada-bds-and-ten-years-of-unemployment/ | access-date=October 4, 2020|quote=Nobody talks about the blockade of Gaza anymore, it’s all about BDS: Is BDS anti-Semitic?

But it must also be said that BDS made it very easy for Israel, by refusing to recognize its legality as a state within the pre-June 1967 borders. BDS enabled Israel to wrap itself in the cloak of victimhood.}}</ref>

Finkelstein's criticism of BDS has put him on a collision course with other voices in the Palestinian solidarity movement who support it. He suspects that his public criticism has caused him to be locked out of the pro-Palestinian debating circuit:

{{quote|text=A month ago, Mehdi Hasan’s program Up Front contacted me. They wanted me to join a debate on BDS. But the BDS leaders refused to appear on the program. It’s happened more times than I care to remember. One BDS leader told Democracy Now!, “Why debate Finkelstein? He’s not important. We should debate important people.” I used to give 40 talks a year. Now I give maybe four. I know the number because of those 1099 slips I have to submit to my accountant. Three years ago, before the BDS thing exploded, I gave him 40 slips. Last year I gave him four.<ref name="mw16"/>}}

Both [[Ali Abunimah]] and [[Steven Salaita]] have written articles criticizing Finkelstein's arguments.<ref name="alj12feb28"/><ref>{{cite web | title=Dershowitz and Finkelstein: comrades at heart? | website=The Electronic Intifada | date=June 28, 2013 | url=https://electronicintifada.net/content/dershowitz-and-finkelstein-comrades-heart/12574 | access-date=October 4, 2020}}</ref>

==Other statements==
===''Charlie Hebdo'' shootings===
On the shooters of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] on January 7, 2015, Finkelstein commented two weeks later:
 
<blockquote>So two despairing and desperate young men act out their despair and desperation against this political pornography no different than ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', who in the midst of all of this death and destruction decide it's somehow noble to degrade, demean, humiliate and insult the people. I'm sorry, maybe it is very politically incorrect. I have no sympathy for [the staff of ''Charlie Hebdo'']. Should they have been killed? Of course not. But of course, [[Julius Streicher|Streicher]] shouldn't have been hung [''sic'']. I don't hear that from many people."<ref>{{cite news|last=Caglayan|first=Mustafa|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/politics/norman-finkelstein-charlie-hebdo-is-sadism-not-satire/82824|title=Norman Finkelstein: Charlie Hebdo is sadism, not satire|work=[[Anadolu Agency]]|location=Ankara, Turkey|date=January 19, 2015|access-date=August 23, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

=== On Holocaust denial ===
In a July 2020 online discussion with British activists, Finkelstein said [[David Irving]] "was a very good historian". Finding insufficient the evidence of [[Richard J. Evans]] as the expert witness in [[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd|Irving's unsuccessful libel action]] in 2000 against [[Deborah Lipstadt]], who had labeled Irving a [[Holocaust denier]], Finkelstein said Irving had "produced works that are substantive…If you don’t like it, don’t read it. In the case of Irving, he knew a thing or two—or three".<ref>{{cite news|last=Harpin|first=Lee|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/norman-finkelstein-praises-holocaust-denier-david-irving-at-pro-corbyn-group-meeting-1.502134|title=Norman Finkelstein praises Holocaust denier David Irving at pro-Corbyn group meeting|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=July 31, 2020|access-date=July 31, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://cst.org.uk/news/blog/2020/08/07/the-far-left-event-that-attacked-cst-and-praised-david-irving|title=The far left event that attacked CST and praised David Irving|work=Community Securities Trust|location=UK|date=August 7, 2020|access-date=August 9, 2020}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2000 accused Finkelstein in ''The Holocaust Industry'' of defending Irving against Lipstadt,<ref name="DTel2000">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/4253017/Shameful.html|title=Shameful|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=July 14, 2000|access-date=August 10, 2020}}</ref> and, according to historian [[Tobias Abse]], giving Irving qualified, secondhand praise.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abse|first=Tobias|url=http://www.whatnextjournal.org.uk/Pages/Newint/Finkel.html|title=Finkelstein's Follies: The Dangers of Vulgar Anti-Zionism|work=New Interventions|volume=10|issue=2|date=2000|access-date=September 2, 2020}}</ref>

In October 2020, Finkelstein published an extract from his forthcoming book, ''Cancel Culture, Academic Freedom and Me'' on his website following the banning of Holocaust denial from [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. According to Finkelstein, "Holocaust denial should be taught in university and preferably by a Holocaust denier" as a means "to inoculate students" against it. He states: "If one is committed to the purity of truth, not just in its wholeness but also in its parts, then a Holocaust denier performs the useful function of ferreting out 'local' errors, precisely because he is a devil’s advocate—that is, fanatically committed to 'unmasking' the 'hoax of the 20th century.'"<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Aleks|url=https://www.thejc.com/norman-finkelstein-students-should-be-taught-about-holocaust-denial-ideally-by-a-holocaust-denier-1.507888?fbclid=IwAR3TuNv7Ll46qId3HL1j6NKsrtq8w7adTLRsYDwjQEl_PcZbbc2VbcAlcgs|title=Norman Finkelstein: students should be taught about Holocaust denial, ideally by a Holocaust denier|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=October 23, 2020|access-date=October 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Finkelstein|first=Norman G.|url=http://normanfinkelstein.com/2020/10/21/why-we-should-rejoice-at-holocaust-deniers-not-suppress-them-a-reply-to-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-by-norman-g-finkelstein/|title=Why We Should Rejoice at Holocaust Deniers, Not Suppress Them: A Reply to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey|work=Norman Finkelstein|date=October 21, 2020|access-date=October 23, 2020}}</ref>
