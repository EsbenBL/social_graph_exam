In 2001, Shalala became president of the [[University of Miami]] (UM).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/2y8T1gf|title=Orange Bowl curse haunts Shalala's congressional campaign|first=Marc|last=Caputo|website=Politico PRO}}</ref> She created a UM fundraising campaign called "Momentum," designed to raise UM's endowment from approximately $750&nbsp;million to $1&nbsp;billion; the goal was later increased to $1.25 billion by the end of 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.miami.edu/um-surpasses-1.6-billion-m2-campaign-goal.html|title=UM Surpasses $1.6 Billion M2 Goal|last=News|first=U.

In 2013, the University of Miami sold 88 acres of undeveloped Pine Rocklands, one of the last remnants of the imperiled habitat in Miami Dade County outside of Everglades National Park, to Ram Realty Services, for $22 million. The ''Miami New Times'' described this amount as "a complete steal for the developer in light of the relative worth of nearby property." Also in 2013, Ram Realty and Lennar Corp, worked on at least one project together in North Carolina.<ref name=":0" /> When Shalala ran for the US Congress in 2018, her candidacy was opposed by local environmentalists for her part in the sale of the UM pine rocklands site.<ref name=":0" />

Shalala faced some criticism for her response to a nationally publicized [[University of Miami 2006 custodial workers' strike|custodial workers' strike]] at the University of Miami, which lasted from February 28, 2006, until May 1, 2006. Critics called UM's custodial workers among the lowest paid university-based custodians in the nation and alleged they were not earning a [[living wage]]. The strike prompted Shalala to raise wages. Shalala was also criticized for living in luxury while the custodians did not have health insurance.<ref name="GOODNOUGH">{{cite news|title=Anger Rises on Both Sides of Strike at U. of Miami|last=Goodnough |first=Abby |date=April 18, 2006|work=The New York Times|author2=Steven Greenhouse|page=A.18}}</ref> Shalala criticized union organizer's tactics, including a [[sit-in]] that she said prevented students from attending classes.<ref name="GOODNOUGH" />

In an interview with [[WFOR-TV]], Shalala stated that she supported universal healthcare coverage, but opposed a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare For All]] [[single-payer healthcare]] system because she believed that individuals who liked their current employment-based healthcare plans should be able to keep them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://miami.cbslocal.com/video/3823685-web-video-extra-full-interview-with-congressional-candidate-donna-shalala/|title=Web Video Extra: Full Interview With Congressional Candidate Donna Shalala|date=March 8, 2018|publisher=[[CBS Miami]]|access-date=August 17, 2018}}</ref> On August 28, 2018, Shalala won the Democratic five-candidate primary over [[Florida House of Representatives|state Representative]] [[David Richardson (Florida politician)|David Richardson]]. The outcome of the race was substantially closer than polling predicted, which had her leading consistently by double digits.

Shalala ran against Republican candidate [[Maria Elvira Salazar]], a popular anchorwoman for Miami Telemundo outlet [[WSCV]], in the general election. Shalala's campaign emphasized her experience and sought to tie Salazar to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]], who was unpopular in the district.<ref name="Miami Herald Win House" /> The race proved closer than expected, in part because Shalala does not speak Spanish; the 27th district is over 63 percent [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]. As late as a month before the election, polls showed Shalala either behind or practically tied with Salazar.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article218956830.html|title=Everybody knows her name, but Donna Shalala is finding it difficult to get to Congress|author1=Lesley Clark|publisher=[[McClatchy Washington Bureau]]|date=October 7, 2018}}</ref> However, Shalala won the election at the age of 77, making her the second-oldest freshman Representative in history<ref name="Miami Herald Win House" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Emily|date=2018-12-30|title=Too Old to Be a Freshman in Congress?
