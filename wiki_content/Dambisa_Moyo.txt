====''Dead Aid''====
Moyo's first book, ''Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There is Another Way for Africa'' (2009), argues that government-to-government [[foreign aid]] has harmed Africa and should be phased out. In the book she states that in the past fifty years, more than $1 trillion in development-related aid has been transferred from rich countries to Africa. Then she questions if anything has changed.<ref>Lawler, Joseph. [http://spectator.org/archives/2009/03/16/overcoming-aid2 "Overcoming Aid"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318061131/http://spectator.org/archives/2009/03/16/overcoming-aid2 |date=18 March 2009 }}.

====''Winner Take All''====
Moyo's third book, ''Winner Take All: China's Race for Resources and What It Means for the World'' (2012), examines the [[commodity]] dynamics that the world will face over the next several decades, according to Moyo. In particular, it explores the implications of China's rush for [[natural resource]]s across all regions of the world. Noting that the scale of China's resource campaign for hard commodities (metals and minerals) and [[soft commodity|soft commodities]] (timber and food) is one of the largest in history, Moyo presents her research and conclusions concerning the financial and geopolitical implications of a world of diminishing resources.<ref>[http://www.dambisamoyo.com/books-and-publications/book/winner-take-all ''Winner Take All: China's Race for Resources and What It Means for the World''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528095217/http://www.dambisamoyo.com/books-and-publications/book/winner-take-all |date=28 May 2012 }}.

===''How Boards Work: And How They Can Work Better in a Chaotic World''===
Moyo's fifth book, ''How Boards Work: And How They Can Work Better in a Chaotic World'' was released on 4 May 2021. In it, she provides an insider's perspective of corporate boards. Through her own experiences, Moyo reassesses the three-part board mandate and calls for more transparent, knowledgeable, and diverse boards to steer companies through 21st-century challenges. ''The Financial Times'' noted that the book would be  "highly instructive for aspiring non-executives" and provided ''"thoughtful analysis and reform proposals against which boardroom sophisticates can usefully test their assumptions"''<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/30a30cd6-9b3e-45da-8b2d-e8831faed238</ref>
