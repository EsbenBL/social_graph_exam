'''Richard S. J. Tol''' (born 2 December 1969, [[Hoorn]], the [[Netherlands]]) is a professor of economics at the [[University of Sussex]]. He is also professor of the [[economics of climate change]] at the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]]. He is a member of the [[Academia Europaea]].

==Academic career==
Tol obtained an MSc in [[econometrics]] & [[operations research]] in 1992 and a PhD in economics in 1997 at the VU University Amsterdam. His doctoral thesis was titled, ''A decision-analytic treatise of the enhanced greenhouse effect''.<ref>{{cite book | title=A decision-analytic treatise of the enhanced greenhouse effect |author=Tol, Richard S.J. |year=1997 | publisher=Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam |oclc = 068588209}}</ref> In 1998, he contributed with some nineteen other academics to a joint project of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] at his home university.<ref>{{cite book|last=Feenstra|first=J.F.|date=1998 |title=Handbook on Methods. for Climate Change Impact Assessment and Adaptation Strategies|url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/10440/1/f1.pdf|accessdate=10 October 2008}}</ref>

He regularly participates in studies of the [[Energy Modeling Forum]], is an editor of [[Energy Economics (journal)|''Energy Economics'']], associate editor of ''[[Environmental and Resource Economics]]'', and a member of the [[editorial board]] of ''Environmental Science and Policy'', and ''Integrated Assessment''. [[Research Papers in Economics|IDEAS/RePEc]] ranks him among the top 250 economists in the world.<ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html#pto90 Top 5% Authors on IDEAS/RePEc]</ref>

Tol specialises in [[energy economics]] and [[environmental economics]], with a particular interest in [[climate change]], such as the [[economics of global warming]]. Previously, Tol was a research professor at the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]]. Before that, Tol was the Michael Otto Professor of Sustainability and Global Change and director of the Center for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and board member of the Center for Marine and Climate Research at the [[University of Hamburg]]. Tol was a board member of the International Max Planck Research Schools on Earth System Modeling and Maritime Affairs and the European Forum on Integrated Environmental Assessment.<ref name=deniers>{{cite book | last = Solomon | first = Lawrence | authorlink = Lawrence Solomon | year = 2010 | title = The Deniers: The world-renowned scientists who stood up against global warming hysteria, political persecution, and fraud | publisher = Richard Vigilante Books | location = United States | isbn = 978-0-9800763-7-0| title-link = The Deniers }}, p. 20.</ref> From 1998 to 2008 he was an adjunct professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Department of Engineering and Public Policy, and from 2010 to 2011 an adjunct professor at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]'s Department of Economics.

==Climate change==
According to Tol "the impact of climate change is relatively small".<ref>{{Cite web

}}</ref> Despite being an economist he was also among the [[US Senate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party's]] "list of scientists disputing man-made global warming claims", which stated that Tol "dismissed the idea that mankind must act now to prevent catastrophic global warming".<ref>[http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.SenateReport Minority Senate report]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nRJGz2dt?url=http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.SenateReport |date=10 February 2010 }}</ref>

Tol characterises his position as arguing that the economic costs of climate policy should be kept in proportion to its benefits.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c5b9efaa-c52e-11dc-811a-0000779fd2ac.html Financial Times, Jan 17, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/801df604-a698-11db-937f-0000779e2340,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F801df604-a698-11db-937f-0000779e2340.html&_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3Drichard+tol Financial Times, Jan 18, 2007]</ref><ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19626324.000-economics-demands-action-on-climate-change.html New Scientist, Dec 5, 2007]</ref>

He argues against the 2&nbsp;°C 'guardrail' target for limiting temperature rises.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tol |first=Richard S. J. |date=January 2007 |title=Europe's long-term climate target: A critical evaluation |journal=Energy Policy |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=424–432 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2005.12.003 |citeseerx=10.1.1.175.5572}}</ref> Tol does not advocate another target, but has suggested that a [[carbon tax]] of $20/tC would be a policy in line with estimates of the cost of carbon.<ref>[http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2008-25 R.S.J. Tol (2008), The Social Cost of Carbon: Trends, Outliers and Catastrophes, Economics the E-Journal, 2008–25]</ref> He acknowledges that this level of taxation is too low to significantly discourage fossil fuel use but argues it would help to stimulate the development of fuel-saving technology and improve the competitiveness of renewable energy sources. He states that compliance may affect the coal and oil industries and the people they employ.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In an interview with [[Der Spiegel]] in 2005, he argued that temperature rises between 2–4&nbsp;°C would also have advantages. North of a line drawn from Paris to [[Munich]], people would benefit, e.g., from reduced energy bills. However, south of it, people would be overall "losers" of climate change.<ref>[http://www.fnu.zmaw.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/news/spiegel-Tol-interview.pdf Spiegel, Feb 21, 2005]</ref>

In 2007, Tol predicted a reduction in annual economic growth by 0.4% in the [[Republic of Ireland]] if greenhouse gases were reduced by 3% per year.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2007/1220/1197997063183.html Irish Times, Dec 20, 2007]</ref>

In 2009, Tol published a controversial paper that combined data from several earlier studies, concluding that at least some amount of global warming could lead to economic gains.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1257/jep.23.2.29| title = The Economic Effects of Climate Change| journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 29–51| year = 2009| last1 = Tol | first1 = R. S. J. | doi-access = free}}</ref> In 2014, he published an update, correcting missing minus signs that had turned economic costs into benefits and adding data overlooked before; the mistakes he attributed to "[[gremlin]]s". According to Tol, the old and new results were not significantly different.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1257/jep.28.2.221| title = Correction and Update: The Economic Effects of Climate Change| journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives| volume = 28| issue = 2| pages = 221–226| year = 2014| last1 = Tol | first1 = R.S.J.}}</ref> The degree to which the corrected, more pessimistic results alter the original conclusions and their policy implications was hotly debated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://retractionwatch.com/2014/05/21/gremlins-caused-errors-in-climate-change-paper-showing-gains-from-global-warming/ |title="Gremlins" caused errors in climate change paper showing gains from global warming |author=Adam Marcus |date=21 May 2014 |work=Retraction Watch |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/23/the-gremlins-did-it-iffy-curve-fit-drives-strong-policy-conclusions/ |title=The gremlins did it?

Tol was a coordinating lead author for the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. Tol said in March 2014 that he had withdrawn from the writing team for the Summary for Policy Makers of the report in September 2013, citing disagreement with the profile of the report which he considered too alarmist and putting too little emphasis on opportunities to adapt to climate changes.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/27/ipcc-author-climate-report-alarmist IPCC author brands upcoming climate report 'alarmist'] ''The Guardian''. 28 March 2014. Retrieved 29 March 2014</ref> On 20 May 2014 Tol wrote, in an article for [[FoxNews.com]], that the IPCC is alarmist because it favors initial scientific papers published on an issue, rather than the follow-up papers, which, he says, tend to "pooh-pooh the initial drama."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/20/un-climate-change-expert-reveals-bias-in-global-warming-report/ | title=UN climate change expert reveals bias in global warming report | publisher=Fox News Channel | date=20 May 2014 | accessdate=20 May 2014 | author=Tol, Richard}}</ref>

===Copenhagen Consensus===
[[Bjørn Lomborg]] chose Tol to participate in his "[[Copenhagen Consensus]]" project in 2008. In 2008, Tol collaborated with [[Gary Yohe]], [[Richard G. Richels]], and Geoffrey Blanford to prepare the "Challenge Paper" on global warming which examined three approaches devised by Lomborg for tackling the issue.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The 3 results were then compared with 27 similar investigations, 3 each relating to 9 other 'challenges' in the areas of health and environment. Of the 30 policy alternatives that resulted, Lomborg's ranking procedure rated the 2 dealing with controlling [[Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions of greenhouse gases]] 29th and 30th in terms of cost effectiveness.

A "perspective paper" by Anil Markandya of the [[University of Bath]] on the Yohe/Tol study stated that "a short time period analysis is misleading" when all the costs are incurred during the period examined but benefits continue to accrue after its conclusion.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> He pointed out that the study "stops short of the most that can be supported on a cost benefit basis" and stated that "it does not seem reasonable" to rely solely on Tol's own FUND model when alternatives "reported in the peer-reviewed literature are also credible".

[[Gary Yohe]] later accused Lomborg of "deliberate distortion of our conclusions",<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/climatechange.carbonemissions | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Climate change is real, compelling and urgent | first=Gary | last=Yohe | date=22 August 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> adding that "as one of the authors of the Copenhagen Consensus Project's principal climate paper, I can say with certainty that Lomborg is misrepresenting our findings thanks to a highly selective memory". In a subsequent joint statement settling their differences, Lomborg and Yohe agreed that the "failure" of Lomborg's emissions reduction plan "could be traced to faulty design".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=It's not about us | first=Björn | last=Lomborg | date=1 September 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>

Lomborg awarded Tol a position on his Copenhagen Consensus panel again in 2009. According to Tol, "Lomborg successfully punches holes in climate hysteria" and "plays a useful role in the debate on climate policy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2010/04/30/economics-voodoo-and-climate-policy/ |title=The Irish Economy » Blog Archive » Economics, voodoo, and climate policy |publisher=Irisheconomy.ie |date=30 April 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>

===Climate change and conflict===
According to Tol, "it is not clear whether climate change would lead to conflict".<ref name=Tol5>{{cite journal |author= Tol, RSJ |year= 2008 |title= Why Worry About Climate Change? A Research Agenda |journal= Environmental Values |volume= 17 |pages= 437–470 |url= http://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/tol/RM8133.pdf |doi= 10.3197/096327108X368485 |issue= 4 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103630/http://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/tol/RM8133.pdf |archivedate= 19 July 2011 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.175.5947 |hdl= 10419/73981 }}</ref> Citing a lack of suitable methods for evaluating hypothetical conflicts numerically, he examines what he calls plausible scenarios, such as drought and migration in the [[Horn of Africa]] or an upsurge in terrorism.

Regarding terrorism, he says "it may well be that a Maldivian terrorist will try and blow up the headquarters of ExxonAramco".<ref name=Tol5/> Regarding the Horn of Africa scenario, he acknowledges it might cause substantial human suffering but assesses the probability of this actually happening as unlikely. He concludes that "poor and exhausted people are unlikely to take up arms, and if they do, they are probably not very effective".<ref name=Tol5/>
