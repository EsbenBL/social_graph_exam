'''Émile Pereire''' (3 December 1800, [[Bordeaux]] - 5 January 1875, [[Paris]]) and his brother '''Isaac Pereire''' (25 November 1806, [[Bordeaux]] – 12 July 1880, [[Gretz-Armainvilliers]]) were major figures in the development of France's finance and infrastructure during the [[Second French Empire]].<ref name=Autin>{{cite book|author=Jean Autin |title=Les frères Pereire : Le bonheur d'entreprendre |publisher=Perrin |location=Paris |date=1984}}</ref> The '''Pereire brothers''' challenged the dominance of the [[Rothschild banking family of France|Rothschilds]] in continental European finance, known at the time as ''haute finance''. Their attempt was temporarily successful, and even though it collapsed in the late 1860s, it contributed to a more developed and vibrant economic landscape. Like the Rothschilds, the Pereires were [[Jews]], but unlike them, they were [[Sephardi]] of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese origin]].

==Family==

The brothers' grandfather was [[Jacob Rodrigues Pereira]], one of the inventors of [[manual language]] for the deaf, who was born in [[Spain]] and established himself in France in 1741, where he became an interpreter for King [[Louis XV]]. Jacob Rodrigues Pereire (as he went by in French) married Miriam Lopès Dias, a Sephardic Jew from [[Bayonne]], in [[Bordeaux]] in 1766. Their son Isaac (1770-1806) was conscripted during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and in 1800 married Rebecca Henriette Lopès Fonseca (1777-1827), daughter of Mardochée Lopès Fonseca and Esther de Daniel Delvaille, both also Sephardic Jews from [[Bayonne]] who had moved to Bordeaux in 1788.{{R|Davies|page=17}} They had three male children, of whom the second, Mardochée Télèphe (1803-1820) died in young age.

In 1824 Emile Pereire married his cousin Herminie Rodrigues, whose mother was Henriette's sister.{{R|Davies|page=40}} They had five surviving children: Fanny (born 1825), Cécile (born 1829), Claire (born 1834), Isaac-Emile (known as Emile II, born 1840) and Henry (born 1841).

In 1830 Isaac Pereire married Rachel Laurence Lopès Fonseca, a cousin of both him and Herminie;{{R|Davies|page=63}} they had two sons, Eugène (born 1831) and Georges (born 1836). After Laurence's untimely death in 1837 he remarried with his niece Fanny in August 1841. Their three surviving children were Gustave (born 1846), Henriette (born 1853) and Jeanne (born 1856). Two other boys, Jules (1843) and Julien (1845) died in infancy, and a disabled one, Edouard, died in 1876 at age twenty-one.{{R|Davies|page=170}}

Eugène, Emile II, Henry and Gustave all studied at [[École Centrale Paris]]. Several of the Pereire children married into established families of French ''haute finance'' and business elite. Claire in 1853 married Georges Thurneyssen, son of the Protestant banker and Pereire business partner Auguste Thurneyssen. Eugène in 1859 married Juliette Betzi Fould, daughter of Emile Fould, the Pereires' notary and himself a cousin of [[Achille Fould]]. Emile II in 1864 married Suzanne Chevalier, daughter of [[Michel Chevalier]]'s brother Auguste. Henriette married {{ill|Eugène Mir|fr}}, a businessman and politician.

[[Eugène Pereire]], Isaac's elder son, led much of the remaining family business upon his father's death in 1880. His granddaughter [[Noémie de Rothschild|Noémie Halphen]] married [[Maurice de Rothschild]] from the family of the Pereires' longstanding competitors. Gustave's son [[Alfred Pereire]] was a noted historian and bibliographer.

==Business development==

Emile and Isaac Pereire moved from Bordeaux to Paris in 1822 and 1823 respectively, where they initially lived in the house of their uncle {{ill|Isaac Rodrigues-Henriques|fr}}, a banker. They became followers of [[Saint-Simonism]]. They kept their commitment to Saint-Simonian beliefs despite their break with [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]] in the early 1830s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

* the Compagnie Immobilière de Paris, formed in 1856{{R|Davies|page=131}} and which in 1863 absorbed {{ill|Jules Mirès|fr}}'s ailing ''Société des Ports de Marseille'', itself taken over by the [[Banque de France]] together with the [[Crédit Mobilier]] in 1867 and eventually liquidated in 1881{{R|Davies|page=214}}
* the fire and accident company ''La Confiance'' and the house insurance company ''La Paternelle'', both controlled from 1859{{R|Autin|page=129, 389}}{{R|Davies|page=130}}, both among the predecessor entities of [[Axa]]

The Pereires were also instrumental in the creation and/or development of businesses they did not effectively control. These included: 
* the [[Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris]], created in 1848,{{R|Davies|page=120}} one of the main predecessor entities of [[BNP Paribas]]

* the Crédit Foncier d'Autriche, created in 1864{{R|Autin|page=158}}

Even though the Pereires were not involved, their success with the [[Crédit Mobilier]] was taken as a model for the creation in 1856 of the {{ill|Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft|de}}, the {{ill|Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt|de}}, and the [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]].{{R|Autin|page=152}}

The Pereires also sponsored coal mining developments in Lorraine and Northern France.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ralf Roth|author2=Günter Dinhobl|title=Across the Borders: Financing the World's Railways in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1It_7wEJbeIC&pg=PA19|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|page=19|isbn=9780754660293}}</ref>

==Politics and media==

The Pereires were deeply involved in French politics. Emile Pereire was member of Parliament (''député'') for the département of [[Gironde]] between 1863 and 1869. Isaac was similarly ''député'' for the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] between 1863 and 1869, and for the [[Aude]] in 1869–1870. Isaac's son [[Eugène Pereire|Eugène]] was also a ''député'' in the [[Tarn (department)|Tarn]] during the same period.{{R|Autin|page=270}}

They also maintained a lifelong involvement in public debates through the media. In the 1820s Emile wrote regularly in ''[[Le Globe]]'' and from 1830, in ''[[Le National (Paris)|Le National]]''.{{R|Autin|page=38}} In November 1871, Isaac acquired the conservative newspaper ''[[La Liberté (French newspaper)|La Liberté]]'' from [[Émile de Girardin]], and heavily influenced its editorial line in the later 1870s.{{R|Davies|page=226}}

==Downfall==

In the mid-1860s, the Pereires' alliances in the ''haute finance'' began to fray. Their attempt to challenge the issue monopoly of the [[Banque de France]] through the restructuring of the {{ill|Banque de Savoie|fr}}, the note-issuing bank of the former [[Duchy of Savoy]] which had come under French rule following the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)]], was resented by the Pereires' former associate {{ill|Adolphe d'Eichthal|fr}}.{{R|Autin|page=162}} In 1866–7, the Pereire group underwent a severe crisis largely triggered by the burden of their developments in [[Marseille]].{{R|Davies|page=211}} The Pereires were forced to relinquished control of the [[Crédit Mobilier]] on 14 September 1867, at the demand of the Banque de France.{{R|Davies|page=213}} Even so, they kept some of their wealth and properties, but had to face numerous lawsuits in the ensuing years and in 1872 were compelled to sell their art collections.{{R|Autin|page=392}}

In any case, the Pereires' heyday came to an end with the demise of the Second Empire, with which they had been deeply associated. One of the Second Empire's key political protagonists, [[Jean Gilbert Victor Fialin, duc de Persigny|Persigny]], would thus write in his memoirs:{{R|Autin|page=309-310}}

{{Quote|text=I wanted an instrument that would free the new regime (the Second Empire) from the tutelage under which financiers usually hold governments, and which would be particularly dangerous as I felt the hostility of the great financial powers-that-be against the new regime. Without a doubt, had the Credit Mobilier not been there to steer and move them forward, the policy of the Empire, as it would have been forced to compromise with the Haute Banque, could not have been as bold and unconstrained as it was.<ref>French text: ''"Je voulais un instrument qui affranchît le pouvoir nouveau (le second Empire) de la tutelle où les financiers tiennent ordinairement les gouvernements ; tutelle d'autant plus dangereuse que je ressentais l'hostilité des grandes influences financières envers le pouvoir nouveau. Certainement, sans le concours du Crédit mobilier qui les a entraînés et forcés à marcher en avant, la politique de l'Empire, obligé de compter avec la Haute Banque, n'aurait pas été aussi hardie et aussi libre de son essor."''</ref>|author=Persigny |title=Mémoires (1896)}}

==Family properties==

In 1852 the Pereires bought a vast estate in [[Gretz-Armainvilliers]] and commissioned their favorite architect {{ill|Alfred Armand|fr}} to build a palatial country house there in the early 1860s, the ''Château d'Armaivilliers'', to rival the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]]' nearby [[Château de Ferrières]]; it was bombed by mistake by the [[US Air Force]] in 1944 and demolished in 1950.{{R|Davies|page=185}}

In 1854 they purchased the [[hôtel particulier]] on 15 [[Place Vendôme]] to make it the headquarters of the [[Crédit Mobilier]], and kept it as such until 1867. The same building was transformed into a luxury hotel in 1898 by [[César Ritz]] and is now the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]].

In 1855 they acquired their urban mansion, the ''Hotel Pereire'' on 35-37 [[rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré]], initially built in 1713, and had it extensively renovated until 1859, also by Armand.{{R|Autin|page=389}}{{R|Davies|page=180}} That property was purchased by the British government in 1947 and is now the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|Embassy of the United Kingdom in Paris]].

Their villa in [[Arcachon]], built in 1863–1854 in their real estate development there, was demolished in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|website=Arcachon Nostalgie |url=http://www.arcachon-nostalgie.com/img/Villas/Pereire.htm |title=La Villa Pereire (Péreire-Abatilles)}}</ref>

==Legacy==

The Pereires were active in real estate development and created some of the most iconic urban landscapes of the era. These included the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]], first opened in 1842 as one of the main railway stations in Paris;{{R|Autin|page=92, 385}} the [[Parc Monceau]] neighborhood in Paris, on grounds around the park which they purchased from the [[House of Orléans|Orléans family]] in 1861;{{R|Davies|page=156}} the {{ill|Rue de la République (Marseille){{!}}Rue de la République|fr|Rue de la République (Marseille)}} in [[Marseille]], started by {{ill|Jules Mirès|fr}} and continued by the Pereires; and the holiday resort of [[Arcachon]], developed from 1862.{{R|Autin|page=390}}

The {{ill|Boulevard Pereire|fr}} in Paris, above the Pereires’ {{ill|ligne d’Auteuil|fr|Ligne de Pont-Cardinet à Auteuil – Boulogne}}, was given their name in 1863, an extremely rare distinction for living individuals.{{R|Autin|page=194}} The nearby {{ill|Place du Maréchal-Juin|fr}} was called ''Place Pereire'' until 1973. In the same neighborhood, the [[Pereire (Paris Métro)|Pereire Metro Station]] and [[Pereire–Levallois (Paris RER)|Pereire–Levallois RER station]] also carry their name. Other public spaces bearing the Pereires' name are in [[Arcachon]] (''Plage Pereire'', ''avenue du Parc Pereire'', ''allée Emile Pereire''), [[Bayonne]] (''place Pereire''), [[Bordeaux]] (''rue Emile Pereire''), [[Rueil-Malmaison]] (''rue Pereire''), and [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (''rue Pereire''). The former ''{{ill|Avenue Pereire (Asnières-sur-Seine){{!}}avenue Pereire|fr|Avenue Henri-Barbusse (Asnières-sur-Seine)}}'' in [[Asnières-sur-Seine]] has been renamed after native son [[Henri Barbusse]].
