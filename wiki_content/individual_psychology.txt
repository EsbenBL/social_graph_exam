{{Short description|School of psychology founded by Alfred Adler}}
'''Individual psychology''' is the psychological method or science founded by the [[Austrian people|Viennese]] [[psychiatrist]] [[Alfred Adler]].<ref name=Adler1924>{{Cite book|title=The Practice And Theory Of Individual Psychology|last=Adler, Alfred|date=1924|publisher=London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.|isbn=9781136330094|edition=1|language=en|oclc=862745962}}</ref><ref>(Fall, Holden, & Marquis, 2002)</ref> The [[English language|English]] edition of Adler's work on the subject (1925) is a collection of papers and lectures given mainly in 1912â€“1914, and covers the whole range of human psychology in a single survey, intended to mirror the indivisible unity of the personality.

In developing the concept of "individual psychology" Adler broke away from the psychoanalytic school of [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>(Dinkmeyer, Pew, & Dinkmeyer, 1979)</ref><ref>Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 277-8</ref> In this development, Adler did call his work "free psychoanalysis" for a time, but he later rejected the label of "[[psychoanalyst]]".<ref>(Hoffman, 1994)</ref> His method, involving a [[holistic]] approach to the study of character,<ref>(Mosak & DiPietro, 2006)</ref> has been extremely influential in later 20th century [[counselling]] and [[psychiatric]] strategies.<ref>(Oberst & Stewart, 2003)</ref>
 
The term "individual psychology" ({{lang-de|Individualpsychologie}}) does not mean to focus on the individual. Adler said one must take into account the patient's whole environment, including the people the patient associates with.  The term "individual" is used to mean the patient is an indivisible whole.

==Adler's psychology==
{{Further|Alfred Adler#Basic principles}}
Adler shifted the grounds of psychological determinance from sex and [[libido]], the Freudian standpoint, to one based on the individual evaluation of world. He gave special prominence to societal factors. According to him, a person has to combat or confront three forces: societal, love-related, and vocational forces.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Chao|first=Ruth Chu-Lien|title=Counseling Psychology: An Integrated Positive Psychological Approach|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2015|isbn=978-1-118-46812-8|location=Malden, MA|pages=81}}</ref> These confrontations determine the final nature of a personality. Adler based his theories on the pre-adulthood development of a person. He laid stress on such areas as hated children, physical deformities at birth, birth order, etc.

Adler's theory has similarities with the [[humanistic psychology]] of [[Abraham Maslow]], who acknowledged Adler's influence on his own theories.<ref name=":0" /> Both maintain that the individual human being is the best determinant of his or her own needs, desires, interests, and growth.<ref name=":0" />

===The theory of compensation, resignation and over-compensation===
According to Adler, humans are primarily motivated by an inferiority complex.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Rathus|first=Spencer A.|title=Psychology: Concepts and Connections, Tenth Edition|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2012|isbn=978-1-111-34485-6|location=Belmont, CA|pages=429}}</ref> In his view, an individual derives his or her personality traits from external factors that arise out of drive for [[Superiority complex|superiority]].<ref name=":1" /> The character of the individual is formed by his or her responses to their influence in the following ways:

====Compensation====
{{main|Compensation (psychology)}}
Compensation is a tendency to make up for underdevelopment or inferiority of physical or mental functioning<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tudor|first=Keith|title=Adlerian Psychotherapy: An Advanced Approach to Individual Psychology|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-1-317-82234-9|location=Oxon}}</ref> through interest and training, usually within a relatively normal range of development. [[Neurosis]] and other pathological states reveal the safe-guarding or defensive strategems (largely unconscious or out of awareness) of the individual who believes her- or himself to be unequal to the demands of life, in a struggle to compensate for a felt weakness, physical or psychological.<ref>Adler, ''Understanding'' p. 40</ref>

In "normal" development, the child has experienced encouragement and accepts that her or his problems can be overcome in time by an investment of patient persistence and cooperation with others. The "normal" person feels a full member of life and has "the courage to be imperfect" ([[Sofie Lazarsfeld]]).

In less fortunate circumstances, the child, trapped within a sense of inferiority, compensates - or overcompensates, perhaps in [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] fashion<ref>Adler, ''Understanding'' p. 70-1</ref> - by striving, consciously and unconsciously, to overcome and solve the problems of life, moving "from a felt minus to a felt plus". A high level of compensation produces subsequent psychological difficulties.<ref name="Lake, p. 6">Lake, p. 6</ref>

====Resignation====
There are those who give in to their disadvantages and become reconciled to them. Such people are in the majority. The attitude of the world towards them is of a cool, rather uninterested sympathy.

====Over-compensation====
Over-compensation reflects a more powerful impulse to gain an extra margin of development, frequently beyond the normal range.  This may take a useful direction toward exceptional achievement, as the stutterer [[Demosthenes]] became an outstanding orator,<ref>Brian Lake, 'Adler, Alfred', in Gregory ed., p. 5</ref> or a useless direction toward excessive perfectionism. Genius may result from extraordinary over-compensation.  Under-compensation reflects a less active, even passive attitude toward development that usually places excessive expectations and demands on other people.

There are some persons who become so infatuated with the idea of compensating for their disadvantages that they end up over-indulging in the pursuit. These are the neurotics. Thus, external factors are vital in character formation.

===Primary and secondary feelings of inferiority===
{{main|inferiority complex}}
The primary feeling of inferiority is the original and normal feeling in the infant and child of smallness, weakness, and dependency: appreciation of this fact was a fundamental element in Adler's thinking, and an important part of his break with [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>'Inferiority Complex', in Richard Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 368</ref> An inferiority feeling usually acts as an incentive for development.  However, a child may develop an [[exaggerated]] feeling of inferiority as a result of physiological difficulties or handicaps, inappropriate parenting (including [[abuse]], [[neglect]], over-pampering), or cultural and/or economic obstacles.

The secondary inferiority feeling is the adult's feeling of insufficiency that results from having adopted an unrealistically high or impossible compensatory goal, often one of [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]].  The degree of distress is proportional to the subjective or felt distance from that goal.  In addition to this distress, the residue of the original, primary feeling of inferiority may still haunt an adult.  An [[inferiority complex]] is an extreme expectation that one will fail in the tasks of life that can lead to [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] resignation and an assumed inability to overcome difficulties.

===Feeling of community===
Translated variably from the German, ''Gemeinschaftsgefuehl'' can mean community feeling, social interest, social feeling, or social sense.  Feeling of community is a recognition and acceptance of the interconnectedness of all people, experienced on affective, cognitive, and behavioral levels; and was increasingly emphasised in Adler's later writings.<ref>A. Adler et al, ''Superiority and Social Interest: A Collection of Later Writings'' (1964) p. 38</ref>

At the affective level, it is experienced as a deep feeling of belonging to the human race and [[empathy]] with fellow men and women.  At the cognitive level, it is experienced as a recognition of [[Interdependence theory|interdependence]] with others, i.e., that the welfare of any one individual ultimately depends on the welfare of everyone.  At the behavioral level, these thoughts and feelings can then be translated into actions aimed at self-development as well as cooperative and helpful movements directed toward others. Thus, at its heart the concept of "feeling of community" encompasses individuals' full development of their capacities, a process that is both personally fulfilling and results in people who have something worthwhile to contribute to one another.

===Withdrawal===
In cases of discouragement the individual, feeling unable to unfold a real and socially valid development, erects a fantasy of superiority - what Adler termed "an attempt at a planned final compensation and a (secret) life plan"<ref name="Adler 1974 p. 58">Adler, quoted in Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 58</ref> - in some backwater of life, which offers seclusion and shelter from the threat of failure and annihilation of personal prestige. This fictional world, sustained by the need to safeguard an anxious ego, by private logic at variance with reason or common sense, by a schema of apperception which interprets and filters and suppresses the real-world data, is a fragile bubble<ref>Adler, ''Understanding'' p. 188-9</ref> waiting to be burst by mounting tension within and by assaults from the real world.<ref>Ellenberger, p. 608</ref> The will to be or become has been replaced by the will to seem.

===Holism===
Central to the Adlerian approach is to see the personality as a whole and not as the mere net result of component forces. Thus the term '''individual''' (''indivisible'') psychology.<ref>J. & E. Sommers-Flanagan, ''Counselling and Psychotherapy Theories in Context and Practice'' (2012) p. 82</ref> Adlerians adopt a radical stance that cuts across the [[Nature versus nurture|nature-nurture]] debate by seeing the developing individual at work in creating the personality in response to the demands of nature and nurture but not absolutely determined by them. The self-created personality operates subjectively and idiosyncratically. The individual is endowed with a striving both for [[Personal development|self-development]] and social meaning - what Adler himself called "the concept of social usefulness and the general well-being of humanity"<ref>Alfred Adler, ''Understanding Human Nature'' (1992) p. 141</ref> - expressed in a sense of belonging, usefulness and contribution, and even cosmic consciousness.<ref>Henri F. Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970) p. 609</ref>

==Classical Adlerian psychology today==
'''Classical Adlerian psychology''' is also a contemporary academic movement to preserve the genuine values of Adler's work in the present age.<ref>[http://www.adlerian.us/ 'Classical Adlerian Individual Psychology: Alfred Adler's Original Approach']</ref> The contemporary movement describes itself as a values-based, fully integrated theory of personality, model of [[psychopathology]], philosophy of living, strategy for preventative education, and technique of [[psychotherapy]], involving both depth psychology and an appreciation of practical, democratic principles in daily life.<ref>[http://www.adleriansociety.co.uk/phdi/p3.nsf/supppages/0939?opendocument&part=3 'Adlerian psychology'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602213254/http://www.adleriansociety.co.uk/phdi/p3.nsf/supppages/0939?opendocument&part=3 |date=2012-06-02 }}</ref> Its mission is to encourage the development of psychologically healthy and cooperative individuals, couples, and families in order to effectively pursue the ideals of social equality and democratic living.

[[Henri Ellenberger]] wrote in the seventies of "the slow and continuous penetration of Adlerian insights into contemporary psychological thinking".<ref>Henri F. Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970) p. 644</ref>

Adlerians continue to flourish in the 21st century, some employing an eclectic technique integrating elements of other therapies, from the [[psychodynamic]] to the cognitive, others focusing on a more classical approach.<ref>Frew/Spiegler, p. 93-4</ref>

With a solid foundation in the original teachings and therapeutic style of Alfred Adler, the movement today integrates several resources: the contributions of [[Kurt Adler (psychologist)|Kurt Adler]], [[Alexander MÃ¼ller (psychologist)|Alexander MÃ¼ller]], [[Lydia Sicher]], [[Sophia de Vries]], and [[Anthony Bruck]]; the [[self-actualization]] research of [[Abraham Maslow]], himself mentored by Adler;<ref>U. E. Oberst/A. E. Stuart, ''Adlerian Psychotherapy'' (2003) p. 130-1</ref> and the creative innovations of Henry Stein.<ref>[http://www.adlerian.us/  'Classical Adlerian Individual Psychology: Alfred Adler's Original Approach']</ref>

===Striving for significance===
The basic, common movement of every human being is, from birth until death, of overcoming, expansion, growth, completion, and security. This may take a negative turn into a striving for superiority or power over other people. However, this is more about a person trying to find their place in this world and to feel that they belong and are unique.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Rosalyn|title=Theory and Practice of Adlerian Psychology|publisher=University Readers Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60927-627-0|location=United States of America|pages=44}}</ref> Unfortunately, many reference works mistakenly refer only to the negative "striving for power"<ref>Compare e.g. Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 400</ref> as Adler's basic premise.
===Style of life===
{{main|style of life}}
A concept reflecting the organization of the personality, including the meaning individuals give to the world and to themselves, their fictional final goal, and the affective, cognitive, and behavioral strategies they employ to reach the goal: it may be normal or neurotic.<ref name="Lake, p. 6"/>  This style is also viewed in the context of the individual's approach to or avoidance of the four tasks of life: other people, work, love and sex.

===Fictional final goal===
Classical Adlerian Psychology assumes a central personality dynamic reflecting the growth and forward movement of life, reflecting the influence on Adler of [[Vaihinger]]'s concept of [[Fictionalism|fictions]].<ref name="Lake, p. 6"/> It is a future-oriented striving toward an ideal goal of significance, superiority, success or completion: what Adler himself called "an attempt at a planned final compensation and a (secret) life plan".<ref name="Adler 1974 p. 58"/>

The early childhood feeling of inferiority, for which one aims to compensate, leads to the creation of a fictional final goal which subjectively seems to promise total relief from the feeling of inferiority, future security, and success. The depth of the inferior feeling usually determines the height of the goal which then becomes the "final cause" of behavior patterns.

===Unity of the personality===
The position that all of the cognitive, affective, and behavioral facets of the individual are viewed as components of an integrated whole, moving in one psychological direction, without internal contradictions or conflicts. Gerald Corey (2012) stated in his book, ''Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy'', that personality can only be understood holistically/systemically. The individual is an indivisible whole, born, reared, and living in specific familial, social, and cultural contexts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Corey|first=Gerald|title=Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy|year=2012|publisher=Cengage|pages=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NASxLWfwApoC&q=Mosak's%2520five%2520basic%2520mistakes&pg=PT124|isbn=978-0840028549}}</ref> In a recent interview with the Journal of Individual Psychology, Jane Griffith said, "The holistic character of thought is in Adler's choice of the term Individual Psychology. It's one word in German, Individualpsychologie: indivisible. Not to be chopped into bits. Adler also thought that not only is the individual not to be divided up, he's not to be seen as apart from his context either. He said that you can't examine an isolated individual."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rasmussen|first=P. R.|author2=Watkins, K. L.|title=Advice from the Masters II: A Conversation with Robert L. Powers and Jane Griffith|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|year=2012|volume=68|issue=2|pages=112â€“135|url=http://0-search.ebscohost.com.library.uark.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=76259599&site=ehost-live&scope=site}}</ref>

===Private logic (vs. common sense)===
Private logic is the reasoning invented by an individual to stimulate and justify a style of life.  By contrast, common sense represents society's cumulative, consensual reasoning that recognizes the wisdom of mutual benefit.  Harold Mosak in 1995 described Five Basic Mistakes:<ref>{{cite book|last=Corey|first=Gerald|title=Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NASxLWfwApoC&q=Mosak's%20five%20basic%20mistakes&pg=PT133|isbn=978-0840028549}}</ref>
* Overgeneralizations
* False or Impossible Goals
* Misperceptions of Life and Life's Demands
* Denial of One's Basic Worth
* Faulty Values

===Safeguarding tendency===
Cognitive and behavioral strategies used to avoid or excuse oneself from imagined failure.  They can take the form of symptomsâ€”such as [[anxiety]], [[phobia]]s, or [[Clinical depression|depression]]â€”which can all be used as excuses for avoiding the tasks of life and transferring responsibility to others.  They can also take the form of aggression or withdrawal. Aggressive safeguarding strategies include deprecation, accusations, or self-accusations and guilt, which are used as means for elevating a fragile [[self-esteem]] and safeguarding an overblown, idealized image of oneself.  Withdrawal takes various forms of physical, mental, and emotional distancing from seemingly threatening people and problems.

===Psychology of use (vs. possession)===
The perspective that an individual uses his thinking, feeling, and actions (even his symptoms) to achieve a social end.  He does not merely inherit or possess certain qualities, traits, or attitudes, but adopts only those characteristics that serve his goal, and rejects those that do not fit his intentions.  This  assumption emphasizes personal responsibility for one's character.

==Classical Adlerian psychotherapy==
'''Classical Adlerian psychotherapy''' may involve individual [[psychotherapy]], couple therapy, or [[family therapy]], [[brief therapy|brief]] or lengthier therapy â€“ but all such approaches follow parallel paths, which are rooted in the ''individual psychology'' of Adler.<ref>Stein, H.T. and Edwards, M.E., 2003. Classical Adlerian Psychotherapy. HERSEN, M. SLEDGE, WH, The Encyclopedia of Psychotherapy, 1, p.4.</ref>

Adler's therapy involved identifying an individual's private life plan, explaining its self-defeating, useless and predictable aspects, and encouraging a shift of interest towards social and communal goals.<ref>Brian Lake, 'Alfred Adler' in Richard Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 6</ref> Among the specific techniques used were paradoxes, humorous or historical examples, analysis of the self-protective role of symptoms, and reduction of [[transference]] by encouraging self-responsibility.<ref name="Lake, p. 6"/> Adler also favoured what has been called 'prescribing the symptom' â€“ a form of anti-suggestion aimed at making the client's self-defeating behavior less attractive to them.<ref>Gerald Corey, ''Theory and Practice of Counselling and Psychotherapy'' (1991) p. 155</ref>

Based on a growth model of the mind, Adler's approach aimed at fostering social interest,<ref>U. E. Oberst/A. E. Stuart, ''Adlerian Psychotherapy'' (2003) p. 37 and p. 47</ref> and reducing repetitive life styles based on archaic private logic.<ref>Alfred Adler, ''Understanding Human Nature'' (1992) p. 231</ref> With its emphasis on reasoning with the patient,<ref>Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 278</ref> classical Adlerian therapy has affinities with the later approach of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].

At the heart of Adlerian psychotherapy is the process of encouragement,<ref>J. Frew/M. D. D. Spiegler, ''Contemporary Psychotherapies for a Diverse World'' (2012) p. 116</ref> grounded in the feeling of universal cohumanity and the belief in the as yet slumbering potential of the patient or client. By making the patient aware of their secret life plan, the therapist is able to offer an alternative outlook better adapted to the wider world of social interests.<ref>Ellenberger, p. 620</ref>

This process of encouragement also makes the Adlerian approach so valuable to all those professions that concern themselves with the development and education of children - therapeutic education being one of Adler's central concerns.<ref>Ellenberger, p. 621-2</ref>

===Goals/overview===
Adlerian psychotherapy is unique in the sense that each client has their own individual type of therapy. The therapy, however, is created by the therapist on a six-phase process.  The overall goal of the therapy is to establish a relationship between client and community in order not only to challenge the client's unhealthy and unrealistic thoughts of the world, but also to challenge them to replace self-defeating behaviors for ones that will lead to a more positive and healthy lifestyle.<ref name="Hersen, Sledge">Encyclopedia of Psychotherapy, San Diego, 2002.</ref> The stages of this classical psychotherapy are:

*Phase 1: This stage focuses on support and is broken down into two stages. The first stage emphasizes empathy and relationships. The therapist provides warmth, acceptance, and generate hope while giving reassurance and encouragement to the client. The second stage in this phase is focused on gathering information on the client. Early childhood memories and influences are sought out as well as details that provide information on how the client faces life problems.<ref name="Hersen, Sledge"/>
*Phase 2: The primary focus in phase two is on encouragement. This is done through two stages of clarification and encouragement. Therapists clarify any vague thinking with [[Socratic questioning]] and evaluate the consequences of various actions or ideas. They help the client correct inappropriate ideas about his or her self and others. They also help the client create alternative ways of thinking to move his/her life into a new direction while clarifying feelings.<ref name="Hersen, Sledge"/>
*Phase 3: Insight is the headline for phase 3. Interpretation and recognition, as well as knowing are the focus of the Insight phase. The client will learn to interpret his/her feelings and goals as well as identify what s/he has avoided in the past. This stage integrates many Freudian ideas such as dreams, daydreams, and recollections.  The Knowing stage is where the client is now fully aware of his/her lifestyle and does not require any additional help with this. They know and accept what they need to change.<ref name="Hersen, Sledge"/>
*Phase 4: The fourth phase is all about change. Change is first addressed through the stage of an Emotional Breakthrough. This can be achieved through the use of role playing, guided imagery and narration. The next stage is Doing Differently. The client will break old patterns and change their attitude. This is achieved through creating steps which are based on abstract ideas. The last stage in this phase is Reinforcement. The therapist will encourage all efforts made by the client to promote change. They will reward and affirm positive feelings and changes while simultaneously evaluating the progress made by the client.<ref name="Hersen, Sledge"/>
*Phase 5: The final phase is about Challenge. The client goes through a first stage which is characterized by social interest. S/he is instructed to give 100% in all relationships and is encouraged to take risks. S/he is required to extend new feelings of cooperation and empathy to others. Then, through goal redirection, the client is challenged to release his/her old self and open a new self and live by these new values. The last and final stage is focused on support and launching. The therapist will inspire the client to enjoy the unfamiliar, strengthen their feelings of connectedness to others, and to continue self growth.<ref name="Hersen, Sledge"/><ref name="Stages of Classical Adlerian Psychology">[http://www.adlerian.us/stages2.htm Stages of Classical Adlerian Psychology], additional text.</ref>
*Phase 6: The Meta-Therapy phase is for clients who have gone through Adler's therapy, readjusted their lives to better suit their goals, and who are making progress in becoming who they want to be. This ending part of the therapy advises clients to find out what aspects of life are truly important to them, and to pursue these "higher values".<ref name="Hersen, Sledge"/>

The [[Socratic method]] is aimed to guide clients to clarify feelings and meanings, gain insight to intentions and consequences and to consider alternative options. [[Guided imagery]] helps bring awareness, change and growth. [[Role playing]] encourages new behaviors and gives the client practice in how to manage conflict and other challenges.<ref name="Stages of Classical Adlerian Psychology"/>

===Uses===
====Individual====
The basic structure of individual therapy in classical Adlerian psychotherapy is broken down into 5 phases plus a post-therapy follow up, and each phase is broken down into multiple stages, 13 total. Each of these stages has different goals for the client and therapist to accomplish. This is the type of therapy classical Adlerian psychotherapy was designed for.

====Teacher-education programs====
Teacher-education programs have been designed to increase child cooperation in classrooms. Teachers, parents, and school administrators attend these programs and learn techniques to increase their own teaching effectiveness in the classroom as well as how to learn to better handle children. These programs are taught in the same manner that marital programs are taught.

====Couple-enrichment programs====
Similar to group couple counseling, couple-enrichment programs are conducted by trained professionals and have groups of couples (typically about 10) attend and learn how to improve and enrich their relationships. Many different teaching formats are used that include tools such as role playing, the viewing of videos, and the implementation of other psycho-social exercises. Sessions run for about an hour's time.

====Parent and family education programs====
These programs are comparable to classes taught by [[family life educator]]s. The programs focus on building better family relationships.<ref name=" Mosak, Maniacci"/>

==Contemporary techniques==
There are two main contemporary schools of Adlerian psychotherapy, those following [[Rudolf Dreikurs]], and those calling themselves by contrast classical Adlerians. There are many organizations that write about and still practice this psychology (The North American Society of Aldlerian Psychology (NASAP), The Journal of Individual Psychology, the International Associate of Individual Psychology (IAIP), the International Congress of Adlerian Summer Schools and Institutes (ICASSI), and various other organizations). Many universities around the world offer postgraduate training in Adlerian psychology. This psychotherapy is growing and is steadily and increasingly being assimilated into mainstream psychotherapy.<ref name=" Mosak, Maniacci"/>

There is a debate among contemporary Adlerians over the relative roles of belongingness and superiority in determining character, the school associated with [[Rudolf Dreikurs]] emphasising the former, as opposed to the classical Adlerian theorists.<ref>Paul R. Rasmussen, ''The Quest to Feel Good'' (2010) p. 44</ref>

===Dreikurs===
Rudolf Dreikurs is a psychiatrist who studied under Adler in Vienna. While Adler's work was very popular and received well by American audiences, it lost popularity after his death. Dreikurs revived Adler psychotherapy after Adler's death.<ref name=" Mosak, Maniacci"/>

Building on Adler's writings, Dreikurs conceptualised a four-stage approach to Adlerian psychotherapy:
# Establishing the therapeutic relationship.
# Assessing the client's [[Classical Adlerian psychology#Adler's Theory of personality|life style]].
# Promoting the client's insight into their fictive goal.
# Encouraging clients to broaden their interests from the defensive function of a private logic into a broader sense of community.<ref>U. E. Oberst/A. E. Stuart, ''Adlerian Psychotherapy'' (2003) p. 49</ref>

===Classical Adlerian psychologists===
'''Adlerian''' pertains to the theory and practice of [[Alfred Adler]] (1870 - 1937), the founder of individual psychology(''Individualpsychologie'').<ref>Brian Lake, 'Adler, Alfred', in Richard Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 5-7</ref> Adlerian clients are encouraged to overcome their feelings of insecurity, develop deeper feelings of connectedness, and to redirect their striving for significance into more socially beneficial directions. Through a respectful [[Socratic dialogue]],<ref>[http://www.adlerian.us/stages2.htm Henry T. Stein, 'Stages of Classical Adlerian Psychotherapy']</ref> they are challenged to correct mistaken assumptions, attitudes, behaviors and feelings about themselves and the world.

Constant encouragement stimulates clients to attempt what was previously felt as impossible. The growth of confidence, pride, and gratification leads to a greater desire and ability to cooperate.

The ultimate objective of classical Adlerian psychotherapy is to replace exaggerated self-protection (safeguarding), self-enhancement and self-indulgence, with greater self-knowledge and genuine, courageous social feelings.<ref>Adler, p. 139-42</ref> Notable Adlerians include:
<!-- To qualify for addition to this already very large list (we must avoid bloat), the candidate must be internationally known (no matter how well known they might be in their own country). This means an international reputation that can be verified through publications, lectures and profile with various international organisations. -->

==History==
[[File:Alfred Adler1.png|thumb|Alfred Alder]]
[[Alfred Adler]] was greatly influenced by early [[socialism]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]. This can be seen in his early work and theories. He emphasized that individuals themselves can change their lives. Adler and Freud respected one another; however, Adler did not fully agree or accept Freud's theories. Adler believed childhood experiences have influences on people's current problems, but he also did not believe they are the only contributions. He also emphasizes free will and an inborn drive as contributors to current problems people face. He doesn't believe individuals are victims of their past experiences.<ref name="Mosak, Maniacci" />

===Biography===
"Alfred Adler was born to a Jewish family on February 7th, 1870 in the outskirts of Vienna. He was the second oldest child of six. He was often sick as a child, and once he became knowledgeable of death, he decided to become a physician some day.
Adler's childhood sickness made him appear weak and inferior. A teacher recommended that he quit school to become an apprentice shoemaker. Adler's family objected to this and Alfred eventually went to medical school and graduated from the University of Vienna with his medical degree specializing in ophthalmology.
Alfred met his future wife, Raissa Timofeyewna Epstein, in a series of political meetings which revolved around the current rising socialist movement. The two were married in 1897
Adler started a private practice which slowly switched to internal medicine. It was here that he observed that many of his patients had diseases that could be traced to social situation origins.
Adler's first publication discussed how the social conditions of where people worked influenced diseases and disease processes."<ref name=" Mosak, Maniacci"/>

===Career===
Early in his career, Adler was focused on public health, medical and psychological prevention, and social welfare. Later on he shifted towards children at risk, women's rights, adult education, teacher training, community mental health, family counseling and education, and briefly psychotherapy. Adler started a group: The Group for Free Psychoanalytic Research, which was later changed to Individual Psychology, with individual meaning "indivisible".  With this he also founded his own journal. This is when classical Adlerian psychotherapy began. Adler focused on psychoanalysis when he started his own group, even working in his private practice as a psychiatrist, but that did not last long. After World War I he turned to community and social orientation. He was known as a psychoanalyst before World War I. After the war, he was more of a philosopher, social psychologist, and educator.<ref name=" Mosak, Maniacci">Primer of Adlerian Psychology: The Analytic â€“ Behavioral â€“ Cognitive Psychology of Alfred Alder, Brunner-Routledge, 1999.</ref>

===Components===
Adler had many areas of focus, but there are some key components that contributed to classical Adlerian psychotherapy (a.k.a. individual psychology). Children are born with an inborn force, which enables people to make their own decision, and develop their own opinions. He stated that individuals aren't just a product of their situations; they are creators of their situations. A person's feelings, beliefs and behaviors all work together to make each individual unique.
Another area of focus on was the concept of fictions. It is believed that fictions are conscious and non-conscious ideas that are not necessarily aligned with reality, but serve as a guide to cope with reality. People create fictions as ways of seeing themselves, others around them and their environments and that people do this to guide their feelings, thoughts, and actions.

Another concept is finality. This is the belief that there is only one organized force, a fictionate final goal. Fictionate final goal has been established in early childhood and is present for the rest of a person's life. It is mostly unconscious and influences behavior. With fictionate final goal, questions are asked more along the lines of "what for" or "where to" instead of "why" or "where from". The goal and purpose of a behavior is looked at instead of finding the cause of a behavior. The final cause of the behavior is the focus, which is where fictionate final goal is termed.

Social interest is another area that contributes to classical Adlerian psychotherapy. He believes individuals are social beings. The way an individual acts with other people is greatly important in terms of their psychological health. Social interest means feeling a part of a family, group or community. An important concept related to social interest is the ability to feel empathy. Showing empathy is a way to connect with others.<ref name="Mosak, Maniacci"/>

==Criticism==
[[Karl Popper]] argued that Adler's individual psychology like psychoanalysis is a [[pseudoscience]] because its claims are not testable and cannot be refuted; that is, they are not [[falsifiable]].<ref name="Popper">Popper KR, "Science: Conjectures and Refutations", reprinted in Grim P (1990) ''Philosophy of Science and the Occult'', Albany, 104â€“110.
