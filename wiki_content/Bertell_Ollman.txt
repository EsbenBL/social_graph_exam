'''Bertell Ollman''' (born April 30, 1935 in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]) is a professor of politics at [[New York University]]. He teaches both dialectical methodology and socialist theory. He is the author of several academic works relating to [[Marxist]] theory.

Ollman attended the [[University of Wisconsin]], receiving a BA in [[political science]] in 1956 and an MA in political science in 1957. He went on to study at [[Oxford University]], earning a B.A. in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] in 1959, an MA in [[political theory]] in 1963, and a PhD in political theory in 1967. He already had gained much teaching experience before receiving his PhD, and began teaching at NYU in 1967, immediately after earning his PhD.

==''Class Struggle'' board game==
Ollman is also the creator of ''[[Class Struggle (board game)|Class Struggle]]'', a [[board game]] based on Marxism, and from 1978 to 1983, he was president of Class Struggle, Inc., the company that initially produced and marketed the game. The game was later released by a major board game company, [[Avalon Hill]]. It received publicity for its political theme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1510|title = Class Struggle}}</ref><ref>http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/bb_rev.php</ref>

==Career==
Ollman's early work ''Alienation'' has been called the definitive work on the topic,<ref>Leon Rappaport, 'Dialectical Analysis and Psychosocial Epistemology,' in Kenneth Gergen,Mary Gergen, (eds) ''Historical Social Psychology,'' Psychology Press, 2014 p.103</ref> described by [[Peter Singer]]<ref>Peter Singer, ''Marx: A Very Short Introduction,'' Oxford University Press 2000 p.131.</ref> as "more readable than most works on alienation" and hailed as a brilliant and original study not only of Marx's concept of alienation but also of Marx's seemingly cavalier use of language, which, Ollman argued, cannot be adequately understood unless it is read as constantly relational.<ref>Elliott Johnson, David Walker, Daniel Gray, ''Historical Dictionary of Marxism,'' Rowman & Littlefield, 2014 p.,476</ref>

In 1978, after having his offer of chairmanship of the Government Department at the [[University of Maryland College Park]] rescinded, Ollman sued columnists [[Robert Novak]] and [[Rowland Evans]], alleging that a column they authored had libeled him, resulting in the rescinding of his offer. The column had characterized his teaching style as [[indoctrination]], including an anonymous quote from another professor saying, "Ollman has no status within the profession, but is a pure and simple activist." Ollman's suit was defeated in the [[D.C. Circuit Court]], which held that Novak and Evans's column was protected speech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/414841 |title=Ollman v.

In 2001, he won the first Charles McCoy Life Achievement Award from the New Political Science section of the [[American Political Science Association]].

In 2005, as a protest against Israel, Ollman wrote and published a ''Letter of Resignation from the Jewish People'', stating: "Socialist and ex-Jew that I am, I guess I still have too much respect and love for the Jewish tradition I left behind to want the world to view it in the same way as they rightly view and condemn what the ex-Jews who call themselves Zionists are doing in its name. And if changing my status from ex-Jew (current) to non-Jew (projected) stirs even ten good people (God's minyan) into action against the Zionist hijacking of the Jewish label, then this is a sacrifice I am ready to make."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ollman|first=Bertell|title=Letter of Resignation from the Jewish People|journal=Tikkun|date=January–February 2005|volume=20|issue=1|pages=10|url=http://www.tikkun.org/article.php?story=Ollman-letter-of-resignation-from-jews|accessdate=27 July 2011}}{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Sean Hannity dispute==
Ollman appeared on "[[Hannity & Colmes]]" to face the accusation that as [[Sean Hannity]]'s professor in the 1980s, he had given Hannity a lower grade for being a politically conservative supporter of [[Ronald Reagan]]. Ollman pointed out that he had been a Professor of Political Science at [[New York University]] for 40 years and claimed that had he discriminated against conservative students, he "would not have lasted long."<ref>{{YouTube|zsHyhb0_S_8|Bertell Ollman on Hannity & Colmes}}</ref> Ollman gave a detailed account of his teaching and an explanation of why his non-Marxist students "do at least as well as the rest of the class" in a 1978 letter to the editor of the ''Washington Post''.<ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/letters.php#horns A Marxist without Devil's Horns]</ref>
