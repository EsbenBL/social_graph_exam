== Career ==
Baker was a lecturer at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1988 to 1989 and an assistant professor of economics at [[Bucknell University]] from 1989 to 1992. From 1992 to 1998, he was an economist at the [[Economic Policy Institute]]. During this time, he published a paper with [[Mark Weisbrot]] in a journal of [[evolutionary economics]].<ref name=LogicOfContestedExchange-1994>{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Dean|last2=Weisbrot|first2=Mark|title=The Logic of Contested Exchange|journal=[[Journal of Economic Issues]]|date=December 1994|volume=28|issue=4|pages=1091–1114|doi=10.1080/00213624.1994.11505613|jstor=4226888}}{{closed access}}</ref>

In 1999, Baker and Weisbrot co-founded the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] (CEPR), an US independent, nonpartisan [[think tank]] that produces economic research on US national affairs (social security, healthcare, the US national budget), and international topics (the global economy, the [[International Monetary Fund]] or Latin America policy).<ref name=CEPR-ClosingGap-Video-2011>{{cite web|last1=K.S.|first1=Jomo|last2=Weisbrot|first2=Mark|last3=James|first3=Deborah|title=The Scorecard on Development, 1960-2010: Closing the Gap?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpe_jrKYbjA|website=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]|format=Video|date=15 April 2011}}</ref> In that same year Baker was a senior research fellow at the Preamble Center for Public Policy.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Baker has consulted with officials from the [[World Bank]] and provided testimony to the [[Joint Economic Committee]] of the U.S. Congress and to the [[OECD]]'s Trade Union Advisory Council.

From 1996 to 2006, Baker was the author of a weekly online commentary on the economic reporting of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'',<ref>Dean Baker, CEPR, 9 June 2003, [http://www.cepr.net/misc/err_reflections.htm Reflections on Economic Reporting: Seven Years of the Economic Reporting Review]</ref> the ''Economic Reporting Review''. Since 2006, he has continued this commentary on his blog ''Beat The Press,'' formerly published at ''[[The American Prospect]]'' and now on CEPR's website.

=== 2007–08 United States housing bubble ===
Baker won the Revere Award,{{failed verification|date=August 2018}} along with Steve Keen and Nouriel Roubini, for predicting the crash of the [[United States housing bubble]] and the resulting recession, which occurred from 2007 to 2008.{{unreliable source?|date=August 2018}}<ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2018}} https://rwer.wordpress.com/2010/05/13/keen-roubini-and-baker-win-revere-award-for-economics-2/</ref> He warned about the coming crisis and the related government policies in multiple articles, op-eds and interviews from 2002 to 2005.<ref name="economicpredictions.org">{{Cite web |url=http://www.economicpredictions.org/dean-baker-predictions/index.htm |title='' Wall Street Economists: A Research Project on Economic Predictions'' |access-date=2013-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901155755/http://economicpredictions.org/dean-baker-predictions/index.htm |archive-date=2013-09-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Basing his outlook on house price data sets produced by the U.S. government, Baker asserted that there was a bubble in the US housing market in August 2002,<ref name= "baker bubble">{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/the-run-up-in-home-prices-is-it-real-or-is-it-another-bubble |last=Baker |first=Dean |date=August 2002 |title=The Run-Up in Home Prices: Is it Real or Is it Another Bubble? |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] |access-date=2012-06-18}}</ref> well before its peak,<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Reinhart | first1 = Carmen M. | author1-link = Carmen Reinhart | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = Kenneth S. | author2-link = Kenneth Rogoff | year = 2009 | title = This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly | location = Princeton, NJ | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-691-14216-6 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ak5fLB24ircC&pg=PA160 160] (see table 10.8)}}</ref> and predicted that the bubble's collapse would lead to recession.

Baker opposed the U.S. government bailout of Wall Street banks on the basis that the only people who stood to lose from their collapse were their shareholders and high-income CEOs. Of any hypothetical negative effects of not extending the bailout, he said, "We know how to keep the financial system operating even as banks go into bankruptcy and receivership,"<ref>[http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=03&year=2008&base_name=face_slap_or_punch_to_the_head ''Beat The Press''], March 9, 2008</ref> citing U.S. government action taken during the [[S&L crisis]] of the 1980s.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aL39kRBP7IhU William Seidman, Who Led Cleanup of S&L Crisis, Dies], ''Bloomberg'', May 13, 2009</ref> He has ridiculed the U.S. elite for favoring it, asking, "How do you make a DC intellectual look less articulate than [[Sarah Palin interviews with Katie Couric|Sarah Palin being interviewed by Katie Couric]]?

=== ''Rigged'' === 

Baker's 2016 book ''Rigged: How Globalization and the Rules of the Modern Economy Were Structured to Make the Rich Richer'' argues that changing how the U.S. economy has been managed over the past 50 years would add between $2 and 3.7 trillion (in constant 2016 dollars) to the U.S. GDP, between 11 and 20 percent. This is summarized in his Table 8-1:<ref>p. 215 (p. 222 of 263 in the PDF)</ref>

In ''Rigged'', Baker argues that, for example, focusing more on decreasing unemployment and less on minimizing inflation would primarily benefit the bottom 99%, though the top 1% would get some of those gains.

Similarly, Baker suggests that changes in patent and copyright law over the past 50 years have violated their purpose under the [[Copyright Clause]] of the Constitution: "To promote the progress of science and the useful arts". He concludes that if the U.S. had spent the same amount on research and media with the results being placed in the public domain, everyone would be better off, with the possible exception of the ultra-wealthy. In particular, the world would be healthier not having to pay patent royalties to U.S. pharmaceuticals.<ref>ch. 5</ref>

He also insists that so-called free-trade agreements have exempted MDs and other highly paid professionals, not because of any intrinsic difference in what they do but merely because they have more political power than organized labor.<ref>ch. 7</ref>

== Political activity ==
As a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Baker participated in and was arrested at two sit-ins protesting Representative [[Carl Pursell]]'s votes for military aid to the [[Contras]]. In 1986, Baker defeated Donald Grimes in the Democratic primary and ran unsuccessfully against Pursell to represent Michigan's second Congressional district; his candidacy opposed aid to the Contras.<ref name=MichiganDaily-BakerPursellDebate-1986>{{cite news|last1=Earle|first1=Rob|title=Baker, Pursell spar in face-to-face debate|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uw5KAAAAIBAJ&pg=1561%2C2372513|work=[[The Michigan Daily]]|volume=XCVII|number=35|date=22 October 1986|pages=1, 5}}</ref><ref name=Nation-DeanBakerForCongress-1986>{{cite journal|last1=Cockburn|first1=Alexander|title=Beat the Devil: Dean Baker for Congress|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/october-11-1986-ronald-reagan-and-mikhail-gorbachev-meet-in-reykjavik-iceland-to-negotiate-disarmament/|journal=[[The Nation]]|volume=245|issue=13|date=25 October 1986|page=399}}</ref><ref name=MichiganDaily-Endorsement-1988>{{cite news|title=Opinion.
