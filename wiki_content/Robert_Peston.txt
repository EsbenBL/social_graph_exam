'''Robert James Kenneth Peston''' (born 25 April 1960) is a British journalist,  presenter, and founder of the education charity Speakers for Schools. He is the Political Editor of [[ITV News]] and host of the weekly political discussion show ''[[Peston (TV programme)|Peston]]'' (previously ''[[Peston on Sunday]]''). From February 2006 until March 2014, he was the Business Editor for [[BBC News]] and Economics Editor from March 2014 to November 2015. He became known to a wider public with his reporting of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|late-2000s financial crisis]], especially with his [[scoop (news)|scoop]] on [[Nationalisation of Northern Rock|the Northern Rock crisis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/news/meet-the-team/robert-peston|title=Robert Peston|website=ITV News}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Peston is from a Jewish family and is the son of the late [[Maurice Peston, Baron Peston|Lord Peston]], an economist and Labour [[life peer]], and Helen Conroy. As the son of a life baron, he is entitled to the courtesy title "The Honourable", but does not use it. Peston attended [[Highgate Wood Secondary School]], in [[Crouch End]], [[North London]].<ref name="Telg1">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3635393/Robert-Peston-Im-not-going-to-become-smooth-and-phoney.html |title=Robert Peston: 'I'm not going to become smooth and phoney'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 January 2008 |access-date=8 October 2008 | location=London | first=Elizabeth | last=Grice}}</ref> He graduated from [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], with a second-class degree in [[philosophy, politics and economics]],<ref name=telegraph-20160508/><ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain | title= PPE: the Oxford degree that runs Britain | first=Andy |last=Beckett | work=The Guardian | date=23 February 2017 | access-date=19 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Plante|first=Robert Peston, Lynda La|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/10041510/You-may-have-a-first-class-degree-but-Lord-Winston-doesnt-want-you.html|title=You may have a first-class degree - but Lord Winston doesn't want you|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=2013-05-07|access-date=2020-04-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and then studied at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]].<ref name=jc-20080221/>

==Career==
[[File:Robert Peston and crew, 2016 Labour Party Conference.jpg|thumb|Peston with a film crew at the 2016 Labour Party Conference]]
Peston briefly worked as a stockbroker at Williams de Broë,<ref name=DWhite>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2928108/Peston-in-line-as-BBC-voice-of-business.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Peston in line as BBC voice of business |first=Dominic |last=White |date=10 December 2005 |access-date=28 February 2009}}</ref> becoming a journalist in 1983 at the ''[[Investors Chronicle]]'' and joining ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper on its launch in 1986. From 1989 to 1990, Peston worked for the short-lived ''[[Sunday Correspondent]]'' newspaper as Deputy City Editor, before being appointed City Editor of the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' in 1990.<ref name=telegraph-20160508/><ref name="JSilverBio">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/dec/19/mondaymediasection7 |title=This man means business at the BBC |author=Silver, James |date=19 December 2005 |access-date=28 February 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian | location=London}}</ref>

From 1991 to 2000, he worked for the ''[[Financial Times]]''. At the ''FT'', he was – at various times – Political Editor, Banking Editor and head of an investigations unit<ref name="JSilverBio"/> (which he founded). During his time as Political Editor, he memorably fell out with the then Downing Street Press Secretary [[Alastair Campbell]], who regularly mimicked Peston's habit of flicking back his hair, and once responded to a difficult question with the words: "Another question from the Peston school of smartarse journalism."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/people,1482,robert-peston-thorn-in-darlings-side,48854 |title=Robert Peston, thorn in Darling's side|date=8 October 2008 |access-date=28 February 2009 |work=The First Post}}</ref> He became close friends with fellow journalist, now PR man, [[Roland Rudd]], where the two were known as the "Pest and the Rat".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/32df3c52-c2f1-11e0-8cc7-00144feabdc0.html|title=The networker|newspaper=Financial Times|first=Lucy |last=Kellaway|date=12 August 2011|access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref> His last position at the ''FT'' was Financial Editor (in charge of business and financial coverage).<ref name="JSilverBio"/>

In 2000, he became editorial director of the online financial analysis service Quest,<ref name="JSilverBio"/> owned by the financial firm Collins Stewart. At the same time, he became a contributing editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'' and a weekly columnist for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. In 2001, he switched allegiance from the ''Telegraph'' to the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', where he wrote a weekly business profile, Peston's People, and left ''The Spectator'' for the ''[[New Statesman]],'' where he wrote a weekly column.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ifs/hi/newsid_4950000/newsid_4950500/4950578.stm |title=Robert Peston |publisher=BBC| date=14 July 2006 |access-date=28 February 2009}}</ref> In 2002, he joined ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' as City editor and assistant editor. He became associate editor in 2005.<ref name="JSilverBio"/>

In late 2005, it was announced that Peston would succeed [[Jeff Randall (reporter)|Jeff Randall]] as BBC Business Editor, responsible for business and City coverage on the corporation's flagship TV and radio news programmes, the [[BBC News Channel]], its [[BBC Online|website]] and on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today Programme|Today]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

While no impropriety on the part of Peston was implied, it was claimed in ''[[The Observer]]''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/19/bbc-peston-creditcrunch |title=SFO probe |author=Helm, Toby|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> on 19 October 2008, that the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] (SFO) could enquire into the source of one of Peston's scoops which, in September 2008, in the fraught atmosphere of the [[global financial crisis]], revealed that merger talks between [[HBOS]] and [[Lloyds TSB]] were at an advanced stage. In the minutes before the broadcast, buyers purchased millions of HBOS shares at the deflated price of 96p; in the hour following it, they could be sold for 215p. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Greg Hands]] had written to the SFO about this.

On 4 February 2009, Peston appeared as a witness at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Treasury Select Committee]], along with [[Alex Brummer]] (City Editor, ''[[Daily Mail]]''), [[Lionel Barber]] (editor of the ''[[Financial Times]]''), [[Simon Jenkins|Sir Simon Jenkins]] (''The Guardian'') and [[Sky News]] Business Editor [[Jeff Randall (journalist)|Jeff Randall]] to answer questions on the role of the media in financial stability and "whether financial journalists should operate under any form of reporting restrictions during banking crises."<ref>Treasury Committee [http://webarchive.parliament.uk/20090619012820/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/treasury_committee/tc0809pn12.cfm Treasury Committee: Press List]</ref>

On 28 August 2009, Peston had a highly publicised row with [[James Murdoch (media executive)|James Murdoch]], following the latter's MacTaggart lecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/45052|title=Murdoch, Peston in Edinburgh bust-up|publisher=C21 Media|first=Adam|last=Benzine|date=29 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/30/robert-peston-james-murdoch-bbc|title=BBC's Robert Peston in furious face-to-face row with James Murdoch|work=[[The Observer]] |first1=Leigh|last1=Holmwood|first2=James|last2=Robinson|location=London|date=30 August 2009}}</ref> More recently, he repeatedly broke stories relating to [[News International]]'s [[News International phone hacking scandal|involvement with phone hacking]] at times which were perceived as advantageous to the company for Cameron Stout, leading to criticism{{by whom|date=May 2021}} that he had become a Murdoch stooge.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/bbc-in-a-spin-over-robert-pestons-inside-track-to-news-international-2312701.html | title=BBC in a spin over Robert Peston's inside track to News International | location=London | work=[[The Independent]] | first=Ian | last=Burrell | date=13 July 2011}}</ref>

Peston is the founder of Speakers for Schools, a pro-bono education venture which organises speakers from the worlds of business, politics, media, the arts, science, engineering and sports to give talks for free in state schools.<ref name=telegraph-20160508/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.speakersforschools.org/|title= Speakers for Schools|publisher=speakers4schools.org|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref>

On 17 October 2013, Peston was appointed Economics Editor of [[BBC News]], replacing [[Stephanie Flanders]] who was appointed as Chief Market Strategist at [[JP Morgan Asset Management]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He continued as Business Editor, as well until his replacement [[Kamal Ahmed (journalist)|Kamal Ahmed]] took over the post on 24 March 2014.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |title=Robert Peston to become BBC economics editor |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24574963 |work=BBC News |date=17 October 2013 |access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref>

On 4 October 2015, it was announced that Peston would leave the BBC to join [[ITV News]] as their Political Editor, replacing [[Tom Bradby]] who became the main presenter of ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]''. Peston made his last appearance on [[BBC News]] on 25 November 2015, and his first appearance on ITV's ''News at Ten'' on 11 January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/robert-peston-joins-itv-news-expert-line-political-editor|title=Robert Peston joins ITV News' expert line-up as Political Editor|publisher=ITV.com|date=7 October 2015|access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-01-09/hello-and-welcome-to-my-new-home-as-itv-political-editor|title=Hello and welcome to my new home as ITV political editor|date=9 January 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref> He had a significant scoop in April 2016, when Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] stated in an interview he had profited from his father's offshore [[Blairmore Holdings]] trust, after information about the trust had been disclosed in the [[Panama Papers]] release.<ref name=telegraph-20160508/>

In December 2019, Peston apologised for incorrectly tweeting, without verification, that a Labour activist had punched a Conservative Party adviser. Footage was soon released showing that this was not true; he later apologised for his remarks and retracted them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/bbc-and-itv-political-editors-apologise-for-false-hospital-punch-claim-in-tweets/|title=BBC and ITV political editors apologise for false hospital 'punch' claim in tweets|first=Freddy|last=Mayhew|date=10 December 2019|website=Press Gazette}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/10/photo-fake-tory-punch-tweet-storm-boy-hospital|title=The Tories have punched truth in the face &#124; Joel Golby|date=10 December 2019|website=The Guardian}}</ref> In 2020, he said that [[Boris Johnson]]'s government had become [[socialist]]ic, and was "more [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] than Castro".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Asemota |first1=Jed |title=Why free school meals is a political choice |url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/opinion/20128 |access-date=27 November 2020 |work=Varsity Online |date=13 November 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tyrone |first1=Nick |title=Defending Robert Peston's "The government is socialist" tweet |url=https://nicktyrone.com/defending-robert-pestons-the-government-is-socialist-tweet/ |access-date=27 November 2020 |work=nicktyrone.com |date=23 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bilsborough |first1=Joe |title=Austerity – Just by Another Name |url=https://www.tribunemag.co.uk/2020/11/austerity-just-by-another-name |access-date=27 November 2020 |work=Tribune |date=26 November 2020}}</ref>

==Delivery style==
Peston's delivery on radio and television news has attracted comment. Richard Wenner complained of it being that of a "verbal slug – leaving a trail of audio slime".  Tim Teeman in ''[[The Times]]'' described his "intonation" as "raggedy [and] querulous" in 2008,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Teeman|first1=Tim|title=Bianca barrels back on to EastEnders|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bianca-barrels-back-on-to-eastenders-tbp5fj878rc|access-date=13 June 2017|work=The Times|url-access=subscription |date=2 April 2008|quote=Agggh.

==Books==
Peston published his biography of [[Gordon Brown]], ''Brown's Britain'', in January 2005. It details the rivalry between Brown and the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. ''Brown's Britain'' was described by [[Howard Davies (economist)|Sir Howard Davies]], former director of the [[London School of Economics]], as "a book of unusual political significance". The cover of the book describes how "Peston was given unprecedented access to Gordon Brown and his friends and colleagues." Having told Brown's side of the Blair/Brown power struggle, it is believed that Peston used the relationship then built up with Brown for many of his later financial news story "scoops" at the BBC.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In February 2008, [[Hodder & Stoughton]] published Peston's book ''Who Runs Britain? How the Super-Rich are Changing our Lives.'' In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Polly Toynbee]] said of it: "Reading Peston's book, you can only be flabbergasted all over again at how Labour kowtowed to wealth, glorified the City and put all the nation's economic eggs into one dangerous basket of fizzy finance."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/19/labour.economy?gusrc=rss&feed=politics |work=The Guardian |date=19 February 2008 |access-date=28 February 2009 |title=Labour's election hopes rely on things they don't control |first=Polly|last=Toynbee}}</ref>

In September 2012, Hodder & Stoughton published ''How Do We Fix This Mess? The Economic Price of Having it All and the Route to Lasting Prosperity''. ''The Observer'' described it as "A must read...mandatory reading for anyone who wants to have a voice in where we go from here."

His book ''[[WTF? (book)|WTF?]]'' was published by Hodder & Stoughton in November 2017 and charts the events that led up to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 Brexit referendum]]. ''Whistleblower'', his first novel, appeared in September 2021. The protagonist is a [[The Lobby|lobby journalist]] (political reporter) for the fictional ''Financial Chronicle'' and the colourful background to the story, set at the time of the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] in Britain, reflects Peston's detailed knowledge of his subject.<ref>{{ISBN|9781838775247}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dex |first1=Robert |title=The Whistleblower by Robert Peston review |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/the-whistleblower-by-robert-peston-book-review-b953496.html |work=[[Evening Standard]] |date=7 September 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

He lives in [[Muswell Hill]], north London. After a domestic burglary in December 2012, Peston made an appeal for the return of rings that had belonged to his late wife. Peston said: "It's an incredibly distressing time, especially so soon after losing Siân. It's not about the monetary value, it's about the sentimental value. The rings are irreplaceable and they mean a lot to me."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9758431/BBC-business-editor-Robert-Peston-appeals-for-return-of-late-wifes-stolen-rings.html|title=BBC business editor Robert Peston appeals for return of late wife's stolen rings|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Sam|last=Marsden|location=London|date=20 December 2012|access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref>

In September 2018, as part of an interview with '' [[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'', Peston described feeling "desperately guilty" after falling in love with another woman several years after his wife's death.
