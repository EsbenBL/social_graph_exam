'''Michael I. Posner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|oʊ|z|n|ər}}; born September 12, 1936) is  an American psychologist who is a researcher in the field of [[attention]], and the editor of numerous [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[neuroscience]] compilations. He is [[Professor Emeritus|emeritus professor]] of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Oregon]] (Department of Psychology, Institute of Cognitive and Decision Sciences), and an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[Weill Medical College]] in New York (Sackler Institute). A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Posner as the 56th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell III |first9=John L. |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle|s2cid=145668721 }}</ref>

== Education and career ==
In 1957, Posner received his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[physics]] and in 1959, his [[Master of Science|MS]] in psychology from the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. In 1962, he received his [[PhD]] in psychology from the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].<ref name=cv>{{cite web|title=Posner CV 2014|url=https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.uoregon.edu/dist/b/8619/files/2014/07/Posner-CV-2014r-2838egn.pdf|publisher=University of Oregon Psychology Department|access-date=14 February 2021}}</ref>

Posner joined the faculty of the [[University of Wisconsin]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] as an assistant professor of psychology.  In 1968, he joined the faculty of the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]] as an associate professor of psychology. He retired from teaching at Oregon in 2000 with the rank of emeritus professor. In 2003, Posner founded and became coordinator of the Brain, Biology and Machine Initiative at the University of Oregon.<ref name=cv />

Posner studied the role of attention in high-level human tasks such as [[visual search]], reading, and [[number processing]]. More recently he investigated the development of attentional networks in infants and young children. A test of an individual's capability to perform [[attentional shift]] was formulated by him and bears his name - the [[Posner cueing task]].

In ''Chronometric Explorations of Mind'', published in 1976, Posner applied the subtractive method proposed 110 years earlier by [[Franciscus Donders]] to the study of several cognitive functions such as attention and memory. The subtractive method is based on the assumption that mental operations can be measured by decomposing complex cognitive tasks in sequences of simpler tasks. The method assumes that the effect of each mental operation is additive and that it is possible to isolate the effect of a single mental operation by comparing two tasks that differ only by the presence or absence of that mental operation. (See [[Mental chronometry]] for additional information on Donders' experiment.)<ref name=rvw>{{cite journal | last=BAINBRIDGE | first=LEANNE | title=Review of: "Chronometric Explorations of Mind".

Posner applied the same subtractive principle to the study of attentional networks using PET ([[Positron Emission Tomography]]), a neuroimaging technique that produces three-dimensional functional maps of the brain. In ''Images of Mind'', published with [[Marcus Raichle]] in 1994, Posner investigated brain localization of cognitive functions by looking at the patterns of brain activation in progressively more complex cognitive tasks.<ref name=rvw2>{{cite web | title=APA PsycNet | website=APA PsycNet | date=1999-06-01 | url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-97426-000 | ref={{sfnref | APA PsycNet | 1999}} | access-date=2021-02-15}}</ref>  Posner won the 2001 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Psychology, along with Marcus Raichle and [[Steven E.

In 2005, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an edited volume in tribute to Posner's work.  As reported by Steven W. Keele and Ulrich Mayr in that volume, "In May 2003, 10 speakers and a large audience gathered at the University of Oregon in Eugene to pay tribute to the enormously influential contributions Michael Posner has made to the disciplines of psychology and cognitive neuroscience."<ref name=volume>{{cite encyclopedia|title=A Tribute to Michael I.
