Made possible by [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]]'s signing of the [[Morrill Act]] in 1862, the University of California was founded in 1868 as the state's first land-grant university, inheriting the land and facilities of the private [[College of California]] and the federal-funding eligibility of a public agricultural, mining, and mechanical arts college.<ref name="Stadtman">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Verne A.|title=The University of California, 1868–1968|url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/34 34]}}</ref> The Organic Act states that the "University shall have for its design, to provide instruction and thorough and complete education in all departments of science, literature and art, industrial and professional pursuits, and general education, and also special courses of instruction in preparation for the professions".<ref>{{cite web|title=History of UC Berkeley|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|url=http://berkeley.edu/about/hist/index.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123024409/http://berkeley.edu/about/hist/index.shtml|archive-date=November 23, 2010|quote=Founded in the wake of the gold rush by leaders of the newly established 31st state, the University of California's flagship campus at Berkeley has become one of the preeminent universities in the world.|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Berdahl|first=Robert|author-link=Robert M.

In 2007, the [[Energy Biosciences Institute]] was established with funding from [[BP]] and Stanley Hall, a research facility and headquarters for the [[California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences]], opened.  The next few years saw the dedication of the Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences, funded by a lead gift from billionaire [[Li Ka-shing]]; the opening of Sutardja Dai Hall, home of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society; and the unveiling of Blum Hall, housing the Blum Center for Developing Economies.  Supported by a grant from alumnus [[James Simons]], the [[Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing]] was established in 2012.  In 2014, Berkeley and its sister campus, [[UCSF]], established the Innovative Genomics Institute, and, in 2020, an anonymous donor pledged $252 million to help fund a new center for computing and data science.<ref>{{citation |title=Major Gifts to Higher Education|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=March 3, 2020 |url= https://www.chronicle.com/article/Major-Private-Gifts-to-Higher/128264/}}</ref>

== Organization and administration ==

Although the University of California system does not have an official [[flagship campus]], many scholars and experts consider Berkeley to be its unofficial flagship. In some cases, it shares this unofficial status with the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref>

=== Name ===
Officially the University of California, Berkeley, its name is often shortened to Berkeley in general reference or in an academic context (www.berkeley.edu, [[UC Berkeley School of Law|Berkeley Law]], [[UC Berkeley School of Public Health|Berkeley Public Health]], [[Haas School of Business|Berkeley Haas]]) or to California or Cal, particularly when referring to its athletic teams ([[California Golden Bears]]).<ref name="Trademark"/><ref name="BrandManual"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Editorial Style Guide|url=https://campaignidentity.berkeley.edu/language/editorial-style-guide/|access-date=2020-06-26|website=Light the Way: The Campaign for Berkeley|language=en}}</ref>

=== Governance ===
The University of California is governed by a 26-member [[Board of Regents]], 18 of whom are appointed by the [[Governor of California]] to 12-year terms. The board also has seven ''[[ex officio]]'' members, a student regent, and a non-voting student regent-designate.<ref name="Governance">{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/aboutuc/governance.html|title=About UC&nbsp;– Shared Governance|publisher=The University of California|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204194008/https://universityofcalifornia.edu/aboutuc/governance.html|archive-date=December 4, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=November 30, 2008}}</ref> Prior to 1952, Berkeley was the University of California, so the university president was also Berkeley's chief executive. However, in 1952, the university reorganized itself into a system of semi-autonomous campuses, with each campus having its own chief executive, a chancellor, who would, in turn, report to the president of the university system. Twelve vice chancellors report directly to Berkeley's chancellor, and the deans of the 14 colleges and schools report to the executive vice chancellor and provost, Berkeley's chief academic officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/admin/pdf/senior.pdf|title=Organizational Chart&nbsp;– Senior Administration|publisher=UC Berkeley|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217080423/http://www.berkeley.edu/admin/pdf/senior.pdf|archive-date=December 17, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=November 30, 2008}}</ref>

=== Funding ===
{{See also|University of California finances}}
Berkeley receives funding from a variety of federal, state, and private sources. With the exception of government contracts, public support is apportioned to Berkeley and the other campuses of the University of California system through the UC Office of the President and accounts for some 12 percent of Berkeley's total revenues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2013/02/20/uc-berkeley-looks-to-philanthropy/|title=UC Berkeley looks to philanthropy in place of state funding|last=Berryhill|first=Alex|date=February 20, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Californian]]|access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> Berkeley has long benefited from private philanthropy, with considerable gifts from the Flood, Hearst, Durant, Strauss, Lick, Harmon, and Bacon families in the 19th century and from the Hearst, Doe, Sather, Rockefeller, Cowell, Haviland, Bowles, Boalt, and Stern families, among others, in the first half of the 20th century.  More recently, alumni and their foundations have given to the university for operations and capital expenditures.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Berkeley has also benefited from the giving of individuals, corporations, and foundations, notable among which are Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan (pledged $600 million, shared with [[UCSF]] and [[Stanford University]], to form the [[Biohub]]);{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} [[BP]] (pledged $400 million to research biofuels); the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (over $68 million since the foundation's creation), billionaire [[Li Ka-Shing|Sir Li Ka-Shing]] (multiple gifts, most notably a $40 million gift in 2005), Israeli-Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], Thomas and Stacey Siebel, Sanford and Joan Weill, and professor Gordon Rausser ($50 million gift in 2020).{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}  Several significant gifts have been made anonymously, including a 1999 gift of $50 million to support molecular engineering, a 2018 gift of $50 million to support STEM faculty,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2018/07/22/uc-berkeley-sets-fundraising-record-569m-donations-2017-18-fiscal-year/|title=UC Berkeley sets fundraising record at $569M in donations during 2017–18 fiscal year|newspaper=Daily Californian|access-date=July 22, 2018}}</ref> a $70 million gift in 2019 to support the BioEnginuity Hub,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-advancement/_files/annual-reports/2019.pdf|title=University of California Annual Report on University Private Support|date=November 13, 2019|website=University of California Office of the President|access-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref> and a gift in 2020 of $252 million to support data science.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2020/02/29/uc-berkeley-launches-light-the-way-fundraising-campaign-aims-for-6b//|title=Berkeley launches 'Light the Way' fundraising campaign, aims for $6 Billion|newspaper=Daily Californian|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref>

== Campus ==
{{Main|Campus of the University of California, Berkeley}}
[[File:Sather_Gate_at_University_of_California,_Berkeley,_California_LCCN2013633500_(edited).jpg|thumb|[[Sather Gate]], connecting [[Sproul Plaza]] to the inner campus, was a center of the [[Free Speech Movement]].]]
The Berkeley campus encompasses approximately {{convert|1232|acre|ha}}, though the "central campus" occupies only the low-lying western {{convert|178|acre|ha}} of this area. Of the remaining acres, approximately {{convert|200|acre|ha}} are occupied by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; other facilities above the main campus include the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]] and several research units, notably the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]], the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]], an {{convert|800|acre|ha|adj=on}} ecological preserve, the [[University of California Botanical Garden]] and a recreation center in Strawberry Canyon. Portions of the mostly undeveloped, eastern area of the campus are actually within the [[Oakland, California|City of Oakland]]; these portions extend from the [[Claremont Resort]] north through the [[Panoramic Hill, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Panoramic Hill]] neighborhood to [[Tilden Regional Park|Tilden Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenStreetMap Oakland|url=http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2833530#map=15/37.8758/-122.2443|website=openstreetmap.org|access-date=September 10, 2014}}</ref>
[[File:Bancroft_Library_-_University_of_California,_Berkeley_-_DSC04902.JPG|thumb|[[Bancroft Library]], Berkeley's primary special-collections library]]
To the west of the central campus is the [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown business district of Berkeley]]; to the northwest is the neighborhood of North Berkeley, including the so-called [[Gourmet ghetto|Gourmet Ghetto]], a commercial district known for high quality dining due to the presence of such world-renowned restaurants as [[Chez Panisse]]. Immediately to the north is a quiet residential neighborhood known as [[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]] with a large graduate student population;<ref name="berk-post-doc">{{cite web|title=Moving to Berkeley |url=http://postdoc.berkeley.edu/node/28 |publisher=Berkeley Postdoctoral Association |access-date=February 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229062100/http://postdoc.berkeley.edu/node/28 |archive-date=February 29, 2012}}</ref> situated north of that are the upscale residential neighborhoods of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. Immediately southeast of campus lies fraternity row and beyond that the [[Clark Kerr Campus]] and an upscale residential area named [[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont]]. The [[Southside, Berkeley, California|area south of the university]] includes student housing and [[Telegraph Avenue]], one of Berkeley's main shopping districts with stores, street vendors and restaurants catering to college students and tourists. In addition, the university also owns land to the northwest of the main campus, a {{convert|90|acre|ha|adj=on}} married student housing complex in the nearby town of Albany ("Albany Village" and the "Gill Tract"), and a [[Berkeley Global Campus at Richmond Bay|field research station]] several miles to the north in [[Richmond, California]].

[[File:Botanischer_Garten_in_Berkeley,_California.JPG|thumb| The [[UC Botanical Garden]], located in the [[Berkeley Hills]] and by the [[Berkeley Lab]].]]
The campus is home to several museums including the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]], the [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive]], and the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]]. The Museum of Paleontology, found in the lobby of the Valley Life Sciences Building, showcases a variety of dinosaur fossils including a complete cast of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The campus also offers resources for innovation and entrepreneurship, such as the Big Ideas Competition (Blum Center for Developing Economies), SkyDeck, the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology, and the Berkeley Haas Innovation Lab.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/innovation|title=Innovation/Entrepreneurship {{!}} Research UC Berkeley|website=vcresearch.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref> The campus is also home to the [[University of California Botanical Garden]], one of the most diverse plant collections in the United States, famous for its large number of rare and endangered species, with more than 12,000 individual species.

Outside of the Bay Area, the university owns various research laboratories and research forests in both northern and southern Sierra Nevada.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:South Hall--UC Berkeley--Panoramic.jpg|thumb|[[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]] (1873), one of the two original buildings of the University of California, still stands on the Berkeley campus]]

What is considered the historic campus today was the result of the 1898 "International Competition for the [[Phoebe Hearst]] Architectural Plan for the University of California", funded by [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s mother and initially held in the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]]; eleven finalists were judged again in San Francisco in 1899.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/online_exhibits/romapacifica/index.html |title=Online Exhibit on the Hearst Architectural Competition |publisher=Sunsite.berkeley.edu |access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> The winner was Frenchman [[Émile Bénard]], however he refused to personally supervise the implementation of his plan and the task was subsequently given to architecture professor [[John Galen Howard]]. Howard designed over twenty buildings, which set the tone for the campus up until its expansion in the 1950s and 1960s. The structures forming the "classical core" of the campus were built in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Classical style, and include [[Hearst Greek Theatre]], [[Hearst Memorial Mining Building]], [[Doe Memorial Library]], California Hall, [[Wheeler Hall]], (Old) Le Conte Hall, Gilman Hall, Haviland Hall, Wellman Hall, [[Sather Gate]], and the {{convert|307|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[Sather Tower]] (nicknamed "the Campanile" after its architectural inspiration, [[St Mark's Campanile]] in Venice), the tallest university clock tower in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=The 10 Tallest University Clock Towers |url=https://www.bestcollegereviews.org/the-10-tallest-university-clock-towers/ |website=Best College Reviews |date=May 8, 2013 |access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref> Buildings he regarded as temporary, nonacademic, or not particularly "serious" were designed in shingle or [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]] styles; examples of these are North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, and Stephens Hall. Many of Howard's designs are recognized [[California Historical Landmark]]s<ref>{{cite ohp |id=946 |name=University of California, Berkeley Campus |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Built in 1873 in a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Second Empire architecture|Second-Empire-style]], South Hall, designed by David Farquharson, is the oldest university building in California. It, and the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed [[Piedmont Avenue (Berkeley)|Piedmont Avenue]] east of the main campus, are two of the only surviving examples of the nineteenth-century campus. Other notable architects and firms whose work can be found in the campus and surrounding area are [[Bernard Maybeck]]<ref name="mccoy">{{cite book |last=McCoy |first=Esther |author-link=Esther McCoy |title=Five California Architects |location=New York |publisher=Reinhold Publishing Corporation |date=1960 |page=6 |asin=B000I3Z52W}}</ref> (Faculty Club); [[Julia Morgan]] (Hearst Women's Gymnasium and [[Julia Morgan Hall]]); William Wurster (Stern Hall); Moore Ruble Yudell (Haas School of Business); [[Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects]] (C.V.

=== Natural features ===
[[File:Strawberry Creek near Dwinelle Hall.jpg|thumb| The south fork of [[Strawberry Creek]], as seen between Dwinelle Hall and [[Sproul Plaza#Lower Sproul|Lower Sproul Plaza]].]]
Flowing into the main campus are two branches of [[Strawberry Creek]]. The south fork enters a culvert upstream of the recreational complex at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon and passes beneath [[California Memorial Stadium]] before appearing again in Faculty Glade. It then runs through the center of the campus before disappearing underground at the west end of campus. The north fork appears just east of [[University House, Berkeley|University House]] and runs through the glade north of the Valley Life Sciences Building, the original site of the Campus Arboretum.

Trees in the area date from the founding of the university. The campus features numerous wooded areas, including: [[Founders' Rock]], Faculty Glade, Grinnell Natural Area, and the [[Eucalyptus]] Grove, which is both the tallest stand of such trees in the world and the tallest stand of hardwood trees in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://strawberrycreek.berkeley.edu/tour/08eucalyptus.html |title=UC Berkeley Strawberry Creek |publisher=Strawberrycreek.berkeley.edu |access-date=June 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301075156/http://strawberrycreek.berkeley.edu/tour/08eucalyptus.html |archive-date=March 1, 2012}}</ref> The campus sits on the [[Hayward Fault]], which runs directly through California Memorial Stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/ucb_campus.html |title=Hayward Fault: UC Berkeley |publisher=seismo.berkeley.edu |access-date=April 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422164708/http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/ucb_campus.html |archive-date=April 22, 2008}}</ref>

== Student life and traditions ==

[[File:Cal Football From Tightwad Hill - Flickr - Joe Parks.jpg|thumb|Fans atop [[Tightwad Hill]] watch the [[Cal Band]], with views of the [[California Memorial Stadium|stadium]] and the [[San Francisco Bay]].]]
The official university mascot is [[Oski (mascot)|Oski the Bear]], who debuted in 1941. Previously, live bear cubs were used as mascots at Memorial Stadium until it was decided in 1940 that a costumed mascot would be a better alternative. Named after the [[The Oski Yell|Oski-wow-wow]] yell, he is cared for by the Oski Committee, whose members have exclusive knowledge of the identity of the costume-wearer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/cal-m-fb-mas.html |title=California Golden Bears&nbsp;– Traditions |publisher=Calbears.collegesports.com |access-date=June 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905215604/http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/cal-m-fb-mas.html |archive-date=September 5, 2005}}</ref>

The [[University of California Marching Band]], which has served the university since 1891, performs at every home football game and at select road games as well. A smaller subset of the Cal Band, the Straw Hat Band, performs at basketball games, volleyball games, and other campus and community events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calband.berkeley.edu/about-us/ |title=University of California Marching Band ~ About Us |publisher=Calband.berkeley.edu |access-date=June 29, 2013}}</ref>

The UC Rally Committee, formed in 1901, is the official guardian of California's Spirit and Traditions. Wearing their traditional blue and gold rugbies, Rally Committee members can be seen at all major sporting and spirit events. Committee members are charged with the maintenance of the five Cal flags, the large California banner overhanging the Memorial Stadium Student Section and [[Haas Pavilion]], the California Victory Cannon, Card Stunts and [[The Big "C"]] among other duties. The Rally Committee is also responsible for safekeeping of the [[Stanford Axe]] when it is in Cal's possession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucrc.berkeley.edu/ |title=Home |publisher=UC Rally Committee |access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> The Chairman of the Rally Committee holds the title "Custodian of the Axe" while it is in the committee's care.

The Cal Mic Men, a standard at home football games, has recently expanded to involve basketball and volleyball. The traditional role comes from students holding megaphones and yelling, but now includes microphones, a dedicated platform during games, and the direction of the entire student section.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://calspirit.berkeley.edu/micmen/past.php |title=Home |publisher=Cal Spirit |access-date=November 14, 2018}}</ref> Both men and women are allowed to fulfill the role, despite the name. Overlooking the main Berkeley campus from the foothills in the east, The Big "C" is an important symbol of California school spirit. The Big "C" has its roots in an early 20th-century campus event called "Rush", which pitted the freshman and sophomore classes against each other in a race up Charter Hill that often developed into a wrestling match. It was eventually decided to discontinue Rush and, in 1905, the freshman and sophomore classes banded together in a show of unity to build "the Big C".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CalHistory/traditions.html |website=Days of Cal|title=Bear Traditions |publisher=Sunsite.berkeley.edu |access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> Owing to its prominent position, the Big "C" is often the target of pranks by rival [[Stanford University]] students who paint the Big "C" red and also fraternities and sororities who paint it their organization's colors. One of the Rally Committee's functions is to repaint the Big "C" to its traditional color of King Alfred Yellow.

Cal students invented the college football tradition of [[card stunts]]. Then known as Bleacher Stunts, they were first performed during the 1910 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] and consisted of two stunts: a picture of the Stanford Axe and a large blue "C" on a white background. The tradition continues today in the Cal [[student section]] and incorporates complicated motions, for example tracing the Cal script logo on a blue background with an imaginary yellow pen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/cal-m-fb-tour.html |title=California Golden Bears&nbsp;– Traditions |publisher=Calbears.collegesports.com |access-date=June 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303152734/http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/cal-m-fb-tour.html |archive-date=March 3, 2006}}</ref>

The California Victory Cannon, placed on [[Tightwad Hill]] overlooking the stadium, is fired before every football home game, after every score, and after every Cal victory. First used in the 1963 Big Game, it was originally placed on the sidelines before moving to Tightwad Hill in 1971. The only time the cannon ran out of ammunition was during a game against [[University of the Pacific (United States)|Pacific]] in 1991, when Cal scored 12 touchdowns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/victory-cannon.html |title=California Golden Bears&nbsp;– Traditions |publisher=Calbears.collegesports.com |date=September 7, 1991 |access-date=June 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212030716/http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/victory-cannon.html |archive-date=December 12, 2004}}</ref>

=== Student housing ===
{{Main|Housing at the University of California, Berkeley}}
Berkeley students are offered a variety of housing options, including university-owned or affiliated residences, private residences, fraternities and sororities, and cooperative housing (co-ops).

==== University housing ====
[[File:I-House Berkeley front.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[International House Berkeley|International House]] was opened in 1930 with the funding of [[John D. Rockefeller]].]]

The university runs twelve different residence halls: seven undergraduate residence halls or complexes, both with and without themes; family student housing; re-entry student housing; and optional international student housing at the [[International House Berkeley|International House]], built with a gift from [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and the erstwhile home of six Nobel laureates. Undergraduate residence halls are located off-campus in the city of Berkeley. Units 1, 2 and 3, located on the south side of campus, offer [[high-rise]] accommodations with common areas on every other floor. Units 1 and 2 share a common dining hall, Crossroads. The oldest unit, Unit 3, has its own dining hall, Café 3, on the first floor.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-3-berkeley|title = Cafe 3|website = Yelp}}</ref> At the beginning of the 2018–2019 school year, a new building called Blackwell Hall, was opened across the street from Unit 3. These buildings share a dining hall. Further away and also on the south side of campus is Clark Kerr, an undergraduate residential complex that houses many student athletes and was once a school for the deaf and blind.

In the foothills east of the central campus, there are three additional undergraduate residence halls: Foothill, Stern, and Bowles. Foothill is a co-ed, suite-style hall reminiscent of a Swiss chalet. Just south of Foothill, overlooking the Hearst Greek Theatre, is the all-women's traditional-style [[Stern Hall (Berkeley)|Stern Hall]], which boasts an original mural by [[Diego Rivera]]. Because of their proximity to the [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and [[UC Berkeley College of Chemistry|College of Chemistry]], these residence halls often house science and engineering majors. They tend to be quieter than the southside complexes but often get free glimpses of concerts owing to their proximity to the theater.

[[File:Bowles_Residential_Hall_(UC_Berkeley)_(2016).jpg|thumb|[[Bowles Hall]], a co-ed [[residential college]], neighbors the [[Hearst Greek Theatre]].]]

[[Bowles Hall]], the country's oldest residential college, is located on the north side of campus between California Memorial Stadium and the Hearst Greek Theater. Gifted by Mary McNear Bowles in 1929 to honor her late husband, Regent Philip E. Bowles, the college began as a student-governed residence hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bowleshallresidentialcollege.org/|title=Bowles Hall Residential College|website=www.bowleshallresidentialcollege.org|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>  The hall was originally all male until its reopening in 2016 following a $45 million renovation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.berkeley.edu/2016/08/19/residential-college-redux-bowles-is-back/|title=Residential college redux: Bowles is back|last1=Kell|first1=Gretchen|last2=August 19|first2=Media relations{{!}}|date=2016-08-19|website=Berkeley News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14|last3=2016August 26|last4=2016}}</ref> Bowles is known for its [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture, its sense of community, and its unusual traditions and pranks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/bowles.html|title=Dan Wallach / Castle with a Thousand Tales|website=www.cs.rice.edu|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>
The Channing-Bowditch and Ida Jackson apartments cater to re-entry students,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/channing_bowditch.html |title=Living at Cal 2012–2013, UC Berkeley Housing |publisher=Housing.berkeley.edu |access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/jackson_house.html |title=Jackson House |publisher=Housing.berkeley.edu |access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> while the 58-acre [[UC Village|University Village]], located some {{convert|3|mi|km}} northwest of campus, provides housing for students with families.

==== Cooperative housing ====
{{Main|Berkeley Student Cooperative}}
Berkeley students, and those of other local schools, have the option of living in one of the twenty cooperative houses participating in the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC), a [[nonprofit]] [[housing cooperative]] network consisting of 20 residences and 1250 member-owners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsc.coop/index.php |title=Home |publisher=Usca.org |access-date=June 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617145431/http://www.bsc.coop/index.php |archive-date=June 17, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Notable BCS alumni include [[Norman Mineta]], [[Steve Wozniak]], [[Gordon Moore]], [[Nathan Huggins]], [[Marion Nestle]], and [[Beverly Cleary]].

==== Fraternities and sororities ====
About three percent of undergraduate men and nine percent of undergraduate women—or 3,400 of total undergraduates—are active in Berkeley's Greek system.<ref>{{cite web |title=University of California—Berkeley Student Life |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-berkeley-1312/student-life |website=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |access-date=May 6, 2021}}</ref> University-sanctioned fraternities and sororities comprise over 60 houses affiliated with four Greek councils.<ref>{{cite web |title=About CalGreeks |url=http://lead.berkeley.edu/about-calgreeks/ |website=ASUC Student Union LEADCenter |access-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome to CalGreeks.com |url=http://www.calgreeks.com/ |website=CalGreeks |access-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref>

=== Student-run organizations ===

==== Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) ====
{{Main|Associated Students of the University of California}}
[[File:Wellness Room.jpg|thumb|Wellness Room sleep pods: part of a program created by the ASUC, UC Berkeley's official student association]]
The [[Associated Students of the University of California]] (ASUC) is the official [[student association]] that controls funding for student groups and organizes on-campus student events. It is considered{{by whom|date=May 2020}} the most autonomous student government at any university in the U.S. due to its independent funding model, level of university involvement and resources.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} The two main political parties are "Student Action"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studentaction.org |title=Student Action Webpage |publisher=Studentaction.org |access-date=June 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707113918/http://www.studentaction.org/ |archive-date=July 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> and "CalSERVE."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calserve.org |title=CalSERVE Webpage |publisher=Calserve.org |access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> The organization was founded in 1887 and has an annual operating budget of $1.7 million (excluding the budget of the Graduate Assembly of the ASUC), in addition to various investment assets. Its alumni include multiple State Senators, Assemblymembers, and White House Administration officials.<ref>[[Associated Students of the University of California#List of executive officers]]</ref>{{circular reference|date=August 2020}}

The ASUC's Student Union Program, Entertainment, and Recreation Board (SUPERB) is a student-run, non-profit branch dedicated to providing entertainment for the campus and community. Founded in 1964, SUPERB's programming includes the Friday Film Series, free Noon Concerts on Lower Sproul Plaza, Comedy Competitions, Poker Tournaments, free Sneak Previews of upcoming movies, and more.

==== Media and publications ====

Berkeley's student-run online television station, [[CalTV]], was formed in 2005 and broadcasts online. It is run by students with a variety of backgrounds and majors. Since the mid-2010s, it has been a program of the [[Associated Students of the University of California|ASUC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iEZpg3zLf4H5qOdHYdbXD0tpCrRuJ-wO_j1K9D5Hlmo/edit|title=ASUC Bylaw 3206: CalTV|website=ASUC Central Drive (Google Drive)}}</ref>

Berkeley's independent student-run newspaper is ''[[The Daily Californian]]''. Founded in 1871, ''The Daily Cal'' became independent in 1971 after the campus administration fired three senior editors for encouraging readers to take back [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]]. The Daily Californian has both a print and online edition. Print circulation is about 10,000. The newspaper is an important source of information for students, faculty, staff, and the surrounding City of Berkeley.

Berkeley's FM [[Student radio station]], [[KALX]], broadcasts on 90.7&nbsp;MHz. It is run largely by volunteers, including both students and community members.

Berkeley also features an assortment of student-run publications:
* ''[[California Law Review]]'', [[law journal]] published by [[UC Berkeley School of Law|Berkeley Law]], est. 1912.
* ''[[Berkeley Fiction Review]]'', American [[literary magazine]], est. 1981.
* ''[[Berkeley Poetry Review]]'', national [[poetry | poetry journal]], est. 1974.

Democratic Education at Cal, or DeCal, is a program that promotes the creation of professor-sponsored, student-facilitated classes.<ref>{{cite web|title=DeCal|url=http://www.decal.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991104084732/http://decal.org/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 4, 1999|publisher=Democratic Education at Cal|access-date=April 4, 2014}}</ref> DeCal arose out of the 1960s [[Free Speech movement]] and was officially established in 1981. The program offers around 150 courses on a vast range of subjects that appeal to the student community, including classes on the [[Rubik's Cube]], [[blockchain]], [[web design]], metamodernism, [[cooking]], Jewish art, [[3D animation]], and [[3D bioprinting|bioprinting]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DeCal Courses|url=http://www.decal.berkeley.edu/courses|access-date=May 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625045118/https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The campus is home to several [[a cappella]] groups, including Drawn to Scale, Artists in Resonance, Berkeley Dil Se, the [[UC Men's Octet]], the [[California Golden Overtones]], and Noteworthy. The [[University of California Men's Octet]] was founded in 1948 and features a repertoire of barbershop, doo-wop, contemporary pop, modern alternative, and fight songs.  Hewing to tradition, the groups perform weekly under Sather Gate on alternating days. Berkeley hosts a myriad other performing arts groups in comedy, dance, acting and instrumental music, and include jericho!, Improv & Sketch Comedy, The Movement, Taiko drumming, BareStage student musical theater, the Remedy Music Project, Main Stacks, AFX Dance, and TruElement.

Since 1967, students and staff jazz musicians have had an opportunity to perform and study with the [[University of California Jazz Ensembles]]. Under the direction of Dr. David W. Tucker, who was hired by the [[Cal Band]] as a composer, arranger, and associate director, but was later asked to direct the jazz ensembles as it grew in popularity and membership, the group grew rapidly from one big band to multiple big bands, numerous combos, and numerous instrumental classes with multiple instructors. For several decades it hosted the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, part of the American Collegiate Jazz Festival, a competitive forum for student musicians. PCCJF brought jazz artists including [[Hubert Laws]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], and [[Ed Shaughnessy]] to the Berkeley campus as performers, clinicians, and adjudicators. The festival later included high school musicians. [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]] and [[Andy Narell]] are just a couple of its more famous alumni.

Berkeley student organizations also hosts many other conferences, seminars, and musical and theatrical performances, including the annual Sociological Research Symposium.

==== Engineering Student Teams ====

Given UC Berkeley's [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education and its proximity to Silicon Valley, there are a variety of student-run engineering teams that focus on winning design and engineering competitions.

The university's athletic teams are known as the [[California Golden Bears]] (often shortened to "Cal Bears" or just "Cal") and are primarily members of the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Pac-12 Conference]] (Pac-12). Cal is also a member of the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] in several sports not sponsored by the Pac-12 and the [[America East Conference]] in women's [[field hockey]]. The first school colors, established in 1873 by a committee of students, were Blue (specifically Yale Blue) and Gold.<ref name=colors>{{cite journal |title=State Colors |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfA2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18 |department=State-Wide News |journal=University Bulletin |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=August 24, 1953 |page=18 |access-date=July 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Resource Guide: Student history">{{cite web|url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/104history.html|title=Resource Guide: Student history|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|access-date=February 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110222529/http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/104history.html|archive-date=January 10, 2010}}</ref> Yale Blue was originally chosen because many of the university's inaugural faculty were Yale graduates, including Henry Durant, its first president.

The Golden Bears' traditional arch-rival is the [[Stanford Cardinal]], and the most anticipated sporting event between the two universities is the annual football match dubbed the [[Big Game (American football)|Big Game]], celebrated with spirit events on both campuses. Since 1933, the winner of the Big Game has been awarded custody of [[the Stanford Axe]]. Other sporting games between these rivals have related names such as the Big Splash (water polo) or the Big Kick (soccer).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yen|first1=Ruey|title=Big Splash + Big Kick: Cal vs. Stanford in Men's Water Polo and Men's Soccer|url=https://www.californiagoldenblogs.com/2017/11/9/16622170/big-splash-big-kick-cal-golden-bears-vs-stanford-cardinal-in-mens-water-polo-and-mens-soccer|access-date=March 10, 2018|work=California Golden Blogs|date=November 9, 2017}}</ref>

One of the most famous moments in college football history occurred during the 85th Big Game on November 20, 1982. In what has become known as "the band play" or simply [[The Play (American football)|The Play]], Cal scored the winning touchdown in the final seconds with a kickoff return that involved a series of laterals and the Stanford marching band rushing onto the field.
