==Campus==

[[File:Un edificio del Campus Bocconi (28 novembre 2019).jpg|thumb|Building in the new campus]]
The campus was originally located in Via Statuto near the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]], where its first building was inaugurated in 1902. The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:
*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.
*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric "L" letter, which stands for Laude.
*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.
*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The ''Velodromo'' uses a [[geothermal exchange heat pump]] as its [[air conditioning]] system, which provides [[energy conservation]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.comune.milano.it/pls/milano/!turismo?pid=21504&_first=8 Milano per Me - Itinerari - Conoscere Milano - Ravizza<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[marble]] statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.
*Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the [[Library]] building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus [[chapel]] ''"San Ferdinando"'', and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other [[extracurricular]] activities.
*In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielmö Röntgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice [[Grafton Architects]] which designed the innovative building. The [[Grafton Building]] won the "World building of the year" at the [[World Architecture Festival]] 2008 held in Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2008/10/27/universita-luigi-bocconi-by-grafton-architects/ |title=Blog Archive » Universita Luigi Bocconi by Grafton Architects |publisher=Dezeen |date=27 October 2008 |access-date=14 February 2012}}</ref> The new building houses the offices of the entire Faculty, with its Departments and Research Centers in [[Viale Bligny]]. Its underground levels include, in addition to the new Aula Magna, seminar rooms, a spacious foyer, an exhibition area and parking. It is situated next to the ''Velodromo''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.graftonarchitects.ie/work/projects/project.php?resource_id=225|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119031539/http://www.graftonarchitects.ie/work/projects/project.php?resource_id=225|url-status=dead|title=grafton architects » work » learning<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=19 November 2007}}</ref> The 2020 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] was awarded to its designers, [[Yvonne Farrell]] and [[Shelley McNamara]] of Grafton Architects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/2020|title=Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara {{!}} The Pritzker Architecture Prize|website=www.pritzkerprize.com|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref>

Several other administrative and research offices of Bocconi's individual institutes are scattered across the area, especially around Parco Ravizza and Viale Isonzo.

===Dormitories===
Bocconi University provides off-campus students with approximately 1800 places in dorms.

Residences for students are ''Bocconi Residence'', ''Javotte Residence'', ''Dubini Residence'', ''Spadolini Residence'', ''Arcobaleno Residence'', the more modern ''Isonzo Residence'', ''Bligny Residence'', and the latest ''Castiglioni Residence''(inaugurated in 2018) and the former ''Kramer Residence'' (Now closed). The type of accommodation varies between the residences and the choice is among single rooms in apartments for either one, two or four people. The residences offer also services to students such as cleaning services, laundry rooms, study rooms, parking spaces. Many students, however, choose to rent private apartments which are easy to find around the university area.

==Student life==
===Student associations===
The University is home to a number of societies, some of which are directly involved in facilitating students' integration into the campus life environment and in organizing special events ranging from business games to excursions.

===Student publications===
The University hosts several student run publications:
*'''Tra i Leoni''': a campus magazine run by the eponymous society. The title, which means "between the lions", is a reference to the atrium of the main building, which is also a favorite meeting point for students, guarded by two lion statues.
*'''Bocconi School of Law Student-Edited Papers''': the Law School's official student publication.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Tiny Heart Beating: Student‐Edited Legal Periodicals in Good Ol' Europe|author=Federico Longobardi & Luigi Russi|journal=[[German Law Journal]]|volume=10|issue=7|year=2009|pages=1127–1148 |doi=10.1017/S2071832200001516|s2cid=92987833|url=http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/1332/1/PDF_Vol_10_No_07_SI_1127-1148_Russi_Longobardi.pdf}}</ref> The journal's Editorial Board are selected by way of an annual write-on competition, and go on to select and provide feedback on submitted papers, as well as organising the annual call for papers.
*'''IS@B News''': a campus magazine run by the International Student Association (IS@B).
*'''Be OBjective Magazine''': a bimonthly pdf magazine founded by students from the ACME course. The magazine focuses on art, culture, media and entertainment.

===Recreational activities===
Bocconi lies in the [[Navigli|Navigli area]] of [[Milan]], making for easy access to all the main landmarks and activities of the city for its students.

===Superstitions===
In the atrium of the oldest building of the university there are three sets of doors. The central doors, which are larger than the others, have two lions to either side of them. There is a superstition within the university that students who pass in-between the two lions via the central doors risk not being able to graduate. This derives from the old adage "Chi passa tra i Leoni non si laurea alla Bocconi."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tutored.me/it/la-superstizione-vero-ostacolo-gli-studenti-milanesi/3/|title=La superstizione: il vero ostacolo per gli studenti milanesi!|date=8 September 2015|work=Tutored Italiano|access-date=3 December 2018|language=it-IT}}</ref>

The three main buildings of Bocconi, if seen from the top, seem to spell "30L" (30 ''cum laude''), the maximum achievable grade in any exam. The building in Via Roentgen is the "3", the velodromo is the "0" and the main building is a cross of two "L"s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.touringclub.it/destinazione/141189/universita-commerciale-luigi-bocconi|title=Università commerciale "Luigi Bocconi", Milano, localita, Edificio Monumentale|last=Italiano|first=Touring Club|website=Touring Club Italiano|access-date=3 December 2018}}</ref> It is not clear whether it was planned to have such a shape or was just by chance; in any case, it is considered a good omen to the students.
