==Life and education==
Leeson began writing about economics as a teenager:<blockquote>In 1997, [[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] President [[Lawrence W. Reed]] read an articulate letter to the editor…that scolded a previous writer for poor economic analysis of a public policy issue. Reed contacted the writer, assuming that he was a professor of some sort. In fact, the author was a 17-year-old Dow High School student, Peter Leeson.<ref name="mackinac.org">LaFaive, Michael. "Peter the Great." Mackinac Center for Public Policy. October 10, 2005. [https://www.mackinac.org/7377]</ref></blockquote>
As an 18-year-old, Leeson was invited by an economics professor at [[Northwood University]] to lecture in his course.<ref name="mackinac.org"/>

Leeson earned a B.A. in economics at [[Hillsdale College]] in 2001. He received his Ph.D. in economics at [[George Mason University]] in 2005 under the direction of [[Peter Boettke]]. In 2003-2004, he was a Visiting Fellow in Political Economy and Government at [[Harvard University]]. In 2005, he was the [[F.A. Hayek]] Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]].<ref name="cv">[http://www.peterleeson.com/Leeson_cv.pdf Leeson, Peter. ''Curriculum vitae''. ''peterleeson.com'']</ref>

Leeson proposed marriage to his now-wife, Ania, in the preface of his book ''[[The Invisible Hook]]: The Hidden Economics of Pirates''.<ref>Pellien, Jessica.

==Work==
===Economics of piracy===
Leeson's ''Invisible Hook'' argues that Caribbean pirates developed an early form of constitutional [[democracy]] and engaged in behaviors such as flying the [[Jolly Roger]] because doing so maximized their profit.<ref>Shermer,
 Michael. [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pirate-economics/ "Pirate Economics? Captain Hook Meets Adam Smith]." ''Scientific American'' October 1, 2009.</ref>

In the wake of the [[Maersk Alabama hijacking]], his work on piracy drew substantial media attention.<ref>Trumbull, Mark and Mark Sappenfield. "[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0412/p90s01-usgn.html Captain freed from pirates in daring rescue]." ''Christian Science Monitor''. April 12, 2009.</ref><ref>Abraham, Marc. "[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/apr/07/improbable-research-pirates How pirates of old really did the business]." ''The Guardian''. April 6, 2009.</ref><ref>Caldwell, Christopher. "[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/27bf099c-3103-11de-8196-00144feabdc0.html No honour among pirates]." ''Financial Times''. April 24, 2009.</ref><ref name="NYT">Hagen, Ryan. "Pirate Economics 101: A Q&A With Invisible Hook Author Peter Leeson." Freakonomics Blog. ''New York Times''. April 20, 2009. [http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/pirate-economics-101-a-qa-with-invisible-hook-author-peter-leeson/]</ref> In an article published by [[National Public Radio]], he said that "early 18th century pirates, men like [[Blackbeard]], [[Bartholomew Roberts|"Black Bart" Roberts]], and [[Calico Jack|"Calico" Jack Rackam]], were not only thieves. They were also early experimenters with some of the modern world's most cherished values, such as liberty, democracy, and equality."<ref>Leeson, Peter. "In Defense of Pirates (The Old Time Ones)." ''National Public Radio''. April 10, 2009. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102961315]</ref>

Although Leeson is careful to note that he does not praise the criminal actions of pirates, he argues that their self-organization is a useful illustration of how even criminal conduct is based on rational self-interest. In an interview published by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Leeson summarized his thesis:
<blockquote>The idea of the invisible hook is that pirates, though they're criminals, are still driven by their self-interest. So they were driven to build systems of government and social structures that allowed them to better pursue their criminal ends.... The reason that the criminality is driving these structures is because they can't rely on the state to provide those structures for them. So pirates, more than anyone else, needed to figure out some system of law and order to make it possible for them to remain together long enough to be successful at stealing.<ref name="NYT" /></blockquote>

===Economics of bizarre rituals and superstitions===
Leeson's book ''WTF?!'' argues that practices which seem senseless, such as [[trial by ordeal]], [[trial by combat]], and oracular [[divination]], are in fact clever solutions devised by people to overcome social problems.<ref>Leeson, Peter T. ''WTF?! An Economic Tour of the Weird'' Stanford University Press. 2017.</ref> A recurrent theme in his work is that "people—all of them, regardless of time or place, religion or culture, wealth, poverty, or anything else—are rational."<ref>Leeson, Peter T. ''WTF?! An Economic Tour of the Weird'' Stanford University Press. 2017. p.
 XII</ref> Similarly, he maintains that all institutions, including those "that seem obviously inefficient—and, indeed, sometimes downright absurd—are in fact, on closer inspection, efficient and not so absurd after all."<ref>Leeson, Peter T. "Why did Pirates Choose Democracy? And Some Thoughts on the Efficient Institutions View." Coordinationproblem.org. April 20, 2013. [http://www.coordinationproblem.org/2013/04/why-did-pirates-choose-democracy-and-some-thoughts-on-the-efficient-institutions-view.html]</ref>

[[Steven Levitt]] has described Leeson's book as "''[[Freakonomics]]'' on steroids"<ref>[http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/04/good-endorsements-forthcoming-peter-leeson-book.html Cowen, Tyler. Marginalrevolution.com. April 30, 2017]</ref><ref>[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=28090 Stanford University Press]</ref> and described Leeson as "one of the most creative young economists around."<ref>Levitt, Steven. "Freakonomics Meets Pirates of the Caribbean." Freakonomics.com. December 29, 2009. [http://freakonomics.com/2009/12/29/freakonomics-meets-pirates-of-the-caribbean/#more-23769]</ref>

===Economics of anarchy===
Leeson has written extensively on what he describes as "the economics of [[anarchy]]" and has suggested that "[[self-governance]] works better than you think."<ref name="cato-unbound.org">Leeson, Peter. "Anarchy Unbound; Or, Why Self-Governance Works Better Than You Think." ''Cato Unbound''. [[Cato Institute]]. August 6, 2007. [http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/08/06/peter-t-leeson/anarchy-unbound-or-why-self-governance-works-better-than-you-think/]</ref> [[Avinash Dixit]] described Leeson's book ''Anarchy Unbound: Why Self-Governance Works Better Than You Think'' as "an eye-opener," and [[Robert Ellickson]] described it as "masterly."<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9781107629707 Cambridge University Press]</ref> According to Leeson:
 <blockquote>[T]he case for anarchy derives its strength from empirical evidence, not theory.... Despite... significant arenas of anarchy we do not observe perpetual world war in the absence of global government, shriveling international commerce in the absence of supranational commercial law, or even deteriorating standards of living in Somalia. On the contrary, peace overwhelmingly prevails between the world's countries, international trade is flourishing, and Somali development has improved under statelessness.<ref name="cato-unbound.org"/></blockquote>

The Fund for the Study of Spontaneous Orders, which is administered by the [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]], awarded Leeson its Hayek Prize in 2006, noting of his scholarship that:

<blockquote>Leeson has concentrated on the study of the problem of order where no formal law exists, showing how in such diverse situations as trade among strangers, banditry in colonial West Central Africa and modern [[Somalia]], and life in pirate societies over the ages often informal rules emerge that allow order to be preserved without heavy-handed government control.<ref>Fund for the Study of Spontaneous Orders. Atlas Economic Research Foundation.

==Views==
Leeson stated in a column regarding [[Ronald Reagan]] and foreign policy, "Reagan’s foreign policy was predicated on the use of military intervention to achieve the political and economic outcomes his administration was after in foreign countries. I am advocating precisely the opposite—that no such intervention would be desirable."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/08/20/peter-t-leeson/clarifying-matters|title=Clarifying Matters|date=August 20, 2007|accessdate=August 2, 2019|work=Cato Unbound}}</ref>
