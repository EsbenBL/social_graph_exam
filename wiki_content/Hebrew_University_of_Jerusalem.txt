The '''Hebrew University of Jerusalem''' ({{lang-he|הַאוּנִיבֶרְסִיטָה הַעִבְרִית בִּירוּשָׁלַיִם}}, abbreviated '''HUJI''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] based in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. It is the second-oldest Israeli university, established in 1918, 30 years before the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]]. It opened officially in April 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.huji.ac.il/en/cpage/449 |title=Welcome to the Hebrew University |publisher=Huji.ac.il |access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref> The Hebrew University has three campuses in [[Jerusalem]] and one in [[Rehovot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huji.ac.il/huji/eng/aboutHU_e.htm |title=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem – About |publisher=Huji.ac.il |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> The world's largest [[Jewish studies]] library, the [[National Library of Israel]], is located on its Edmond J.

==History==

[[File:Zoltan Kluger. Hebrew University, Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Hebrew University 1937]]

[[File:Declaration ceremony of the Hebrew University of Leopold Philichovsky painting, 1925.jpg|thumb|Painting of the inauguration ceremony, 1925. The Earl of Balfour addresses the audience.]]

One of the visions of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement was the establishment of a [[Jewish]] university in the [[Land of Israel]]. Founding a university was proposed as far back as 1884 in the [[Kattowitz|Kattowitz (Katowice)]] conference of the [[Hovevei Zion]] society, and by [[Hermann Schapira]] at the [[First Zionist Congress]] of 1897.

The [[cornerstone]] for the university was laid on July 24, 1918. Seven years later, on April 1, 1925, the Hebrew University campus on [[Mount Scopus]] was opened at a gala ceremony attended by the leaders of the Jewish world, distinguished scholars and public figures, and British dignitaries, including the [[Arthur James Balfour|Earl of Balfour]], Viscount [[Edmund Allenby|Allenby]], and Sir [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]]. The university's first chancellor was [[Judah Magnes]], who led the school as chancellor from 1924 to 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://new.huji.ac.il/en/page/454 |title=Office of the President &#124; האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים &#124; The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=New.huji.ac.il |date=2017-09-01 |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> In 1935 to 1948 he led the school as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://new.huji.ac.il/en/page/454 |title=Office of the President &#124; האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים &#124; The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=New.huji.ac.il |date=2017-09-01 |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>

One of the most controversial issues during the conceptualization of the university regarded its future official language. Whereas one side, the so-called “Germanists”, proposed a combination of German and Arabic for all non-Jewish subjects, the other side opted for the general use of Hebrew. The former party was afraid the very recent Modern Hebrew might not yet allow high-level academic discussions since it still suffered from a lack of specific technical terms in non-religious contexts. Although this concern can not simply be dismissed as unreasonable, the representatives of this position underestimated the symbolic significance of Hebrew for many Jews, not least of all for those outside the academia. Therefore, they were not able to prevail in the discussion and had to give in to the decision that the new university would be an explicitly Hebrew one.<ref>https://mimeo.dubnow.de/the-language-of-science/</ref>

By 1947, the university had become a large research and teaching institution. Sir [[Leon Simon (Zionist)|Leon Simon]] was Acting President from 1948 to 1949, and he was succeeded as president by Professor [[Selig Brodetsky]], who served from 1949 to 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://new.huji.ac.il/en/page/454 |title=Office of the President &#124; האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים &#124; The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=New.huji.ac.il |date=2017-09-01 |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Plans for a medical school were approved in May [[1949]], and in November 1949, a faculty of law was inaugurated. In 1952, it was announced that the agricultural institute founded by the university in 1940 would become a full-fledged faculty.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weitz |first=Yechiam |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841024.html |title=The subversives on the hill |work=Haaretz |date=March 15, 2011 |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

When the [[Jordan]]ian government denied Israeli access to Mount Scopus, a new campus was built at Givat Ram in western Jerusalem and completed in 1958. In the interim, classes were held in 40 different buildings around the city.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6x3S8eM3spAC&q=attacks+on+medical+convoys+to+mount+scopus&pg=PA193 |title=International Dictionary of University Histories |isbn=9781884964237 |access-date=September 6, 2011|last1=Summerfield |first1=Carol J. |last2=Devine |first2=Mary Elizabeth |last3=Levi |first3=Anthony |year=1998 }}</ref> [[Benjamin Mazar]] was President of the university from 1953 to 1961, [[Giulio Racah]] was Acting President from 1961 to 1962, and [[Eliahu Eilat]] was president from 1962 to 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://new.huji.ac.il/en/page/454 |title=Office of the President &#124; האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים &#124; The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=New.huji.ac.il |date=2017-09-01 |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>

The Terra Santa building in [[Rehavia]], rented from the Franciscan Custodians of the Latin Holy Places, was also used for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/jermandate.html |title=Jerusalem: Architecture in the British Mandate Period |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> A few years later, together with the [[Hadassah]] Medical Organization, a medical science campus was built in the south-west Jerusalem neighborhood of [[Ein Kerem]].

By the beginning of 1967, the students numbered 12,500, spread among the two campuses in Jerusalem and the agricultural faculty in [[Rehovot]]. After the unification of Jerusalem, following the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, the university was able to return to Mount Scopus, which was rebuilt. According to [[Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem|ARIJ]], Israel confiscated 568 [[Dunam]]s of land from the [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] village of [[Isawiya]] for the Hebrew University in 1968.<ref>[http://vprofile.arij.org/jerusalem/pdfs/vprofile/isawyieh.pdf 'Isawiya Town Profile], ARIJ, 2012, p. 14</ref> In 1981 the construction work was completed, and Mount Scopus again became the main campus of the university.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} [[Avraham Harman]] was President of the university from 1968 to 1983, [[Don Patinkin]] from 1983 to 1986, [[Amnon Pazy]] from 1986 to 1990, [[Yoram Ben-Porat]] from 1990 to 1992, [[Hanoch Gutfreund]] from 1992 to 1997, and [[Menachem Magidor]] from 1997 to 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://new.huji.ac.il/en/page/454 |title=Office of the President &#124; האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים &#124; The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=New.huji.ac.il |date=2017-09-01 |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>

===Jewish National and University Library===
The [[Jewish National and University Library]] is the central and largest library of the Hebrew University and one of the most impressive book and manuscript collections in the world. It is also the oldest section of the university. Founded in 1892 as a world center for the preservation of books relating to Jewish thought and culture, it assumed the additional functions of a general university library in 1920. Its collections of [[Hebraica]] and [[Judaica]] are the largest in the world. It houses all materials published in Israel, and attempts to acquire all materials published in the world related to the country. It possesses over five million books and thousands of items in special sections, many of which are unique. Among these are the [[Albert Einstein Archives]], [[Hebrew]] [[manuscripts]] department, Eran Laor map collection, Edelstein science collection, [[Gershom Scholem]] collection, and a collection of [[Maimonides]]' manuscripts and early writings.

In his will, Albert Einstein left the Hebrew University his personal papers and the copyright to them.
