'''John Maurice Clark''' (1884–1963) was an American [[economist]] whose work combined the rigor of traditional economic analysis with an [[Institutional economics|"institutionalist"]] attitude. Clark was a pioneer in developing the notion of [[workable competition]] and the theoretical basis of modern [[Keynesian economics]], including the concept of the [[economic multiplier]].

==Biography==
===Early career===

John Maurice Clark was born November 30, 1884, in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. He studied at [[Amherst College]], graduating in 1905, and received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]] in 1910.<ref name=Miranti>Paul J. Miranti, Jr., [https://egrove.olemiss.edu/acct_corp/168/ "Clark, John Maurice (1884–1963)."] In [[Michael Chatfield]] and [[Richard Vangermeersch]] (eds.), ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia.'' New York: Garland Publishing. pp. 125–127.</ref>

J.M. Clark was the son of economist [[John Bates Clark]] (1847-1938) and shared his father's concern with ethical and policy issues, in keeping with much intellectual thought during the [[progressive era]]. Both father and son worked would work jointly on rewriting and expanding John Bates Clark's 1912 book ''The Control of Trusts,'' with the new edition seeing publication in 1914.<ref>John Bates Clark and John Maurice Clark, [https://archive.org/details/controltrusts01clargoog ''The Control of Trusts.''] Rewritten and enlarged edition. New York: Macmillan, 1914.</ref> Work upon this theme would be continued by J.M. Clark in his ''Social Control of Business'' (1926, revised in 1939).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=11011881622041 |title=Anne Mayhew, review of ''John Maurice Clark: A Social Economics for the Twenty-First Century.'' |access-date=2007-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627063838/http://h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=11011881622041 |archive-date=2007-06-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Clark was an Instructor at [[Colorado College]]  from 1908 to 1910 and at Amherst College from 1910 until 1915, when he left to join the faculty of political economy at the [[University of Chicago]]. He accepted a professorship at Columbia in 1923, assuming the post previously held there by his father.<ref name=Miranti /> He would remain at Columbia for the remaining three decades of his academic life, finally retiring in 1957.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/john-maurice-clark  "John Maurice Clark", Answers.com]</ref>

Throughout his career Clark was concerned with the dynamics of a [[market economy]].

In his early work ''Studies in the Economics of Overhead Costs'' (1923), Clark developed his theory of [[Accelerator effect|the acceleration principle]], that investment demand can fluctuate widely when consumer demand fluctuates. In this he anticipated key [[Keynesian]] theories of investment and [[business cycle]]s.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=286743 Luca Fiorito "John Maurice Clark's Contribution to the Genesis of the Multiplier Analysis," University of Siena Dept. of Econ. Working Paper No. 322]</ref><ref>[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/accelerator.htm  The Aftalion-Clark Accelerator, New School]</ref> Clark also examined the relationship between firm size and production cost, demonstrating the way firms with high fixed costs could dramatically reduce average cost of production by expanding output, thus explaining the price leverage wielded by giant firms in capital-intensive industries.<ref name=Miranti /> The work illustrated the critical importance of accurate cost information for those seeking the effective regulation of [[monopoly|monopolistic]] or [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]] firms.<ref name=Miranti />

Clark's next published work, ''Social Control of Business'' (1926), continued the theme of national economic governance, detailing the institutional, economic, and legal factors that limited social oversight of monopolistic behavior.<ref name=Miranti /> Clark argued that accounting provided an essential mechanism for the monitoring of the behavior of economically mighty firms to assure their operation within the limits established by regulation.<ref name=Miranti />

In his 1931 book ''The Costs of the World War to the American People,'' Clark first broached the concept of the [[economic multiplier]], the idea that "all expenditures give rise to subsequent income effects and that their aggregated sum can always be expressed as a multiple of the original disbursement."<ref>Joseph Dorfman, "Some Documentary Notes on the Relations Among J.M. Clark, N.A.L.J. Johannsen and J.M. Keynes," introductory essay to John Maurice Clark, ''The Costs of the World War to the American People.'' New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1970; pg. 5. The quoted words are those of Hugo Hegeland, ''The Multiplier Theory.'' (1954) New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1966; pg. 251, cited by Dorfman, pg. 5.</ref> In this work Clark developed the idea of multiplier effects for foreign trade and capital investment in advancing this thesis that the actual cost of [[World War I]] to the American people substantially exceeded the sum of nominal expenditures by the government upon the war.<ref>Dorfman, "Some Documentary Notes on the Relations Among J.M. Clark, N.A.L.J. Johannsen and J.M. Keynes," pp. 5-6.</ref>

Clark expanded upon the consideration of the multiplier effect in public planning in his 1935 book, ''Economics of Planning Public Works.''<ref name=Dorfman6>Dorfman, "Some Documentary Notes on the Relations Among J.M. Clark, N.A.L.J. Johannsen and J.M. Keynes," pg. 6.</ref> With America mired in the [[Great Depression]] and book sales weak, Clark was unable to find a commercial or academic publisher for this work. The National Planning Board of the U.S. Government ultimately published the title via the [[United States Government Printing Office]].<ref name=Dorfman6 /> The opus has since come to be regarded as a classic in its field.<ref name=Dorfman6 />

Clark is considered one of the founders of the theory of [[effective competition|workable competition]],<ref>J.M. Clark (1940). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1807048 Toward a Concept of Workable Competition]. ''American Economic Review''</ref>  neither pure competition nor pure monopoly, a neglected [[Alfred Marshall|Marshallian]] insight.<ref>Joseph A. Schumpeter, ''History of Economic Analysis,'' New York, Oxford University Press, 1976; pg. 975.</ref>

===Honors===

Clark was President of the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA) in 1935 and was recognized with that organization's highest award, the [[Francis A. Walker Medal]], in 1952.<ref>"In Memoriam: John Maurice Clark", ''Political Science Quarterly,'' vol. 79, no. 3 (Sept. 1964), pg. ???.</ref>

===Death===

J.M. Clark died on June 27, 1963, aged 78, in [[Westport, Connecticut]].
