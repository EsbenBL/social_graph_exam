===Career===
Elshtain taught from 1973 to 1988 at the [[University of Massachusetts]] and then from 1988 to 1995 she taught at [[Vanderbilt University]] as the first woman to hold an endowed professorship. Elshtain was selected as a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] scholar, a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a Fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, a [[Guggenheim Fellow]], and recipient of nine honorary degrees. In 1995 she became a professor at University of Chicago. She was the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], and a contributing editor for ''[[The New Republic]]''. She was also a Visiting Distinguished Professor of Religion and Politics at [[Baylor University]].

In the 1990s, she chaired the Council on Civil Society, a joint project of the [[Institute for American Values]] and the University of Chicago Divinity School, which issued the report ''A Call to Civil Society: Why Democracy Needs Moral Truths''.{{sfn|Council on Civil Society|1998|p=29}}

She was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and she has served on the boards of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Princeton, and the [[National Humanities Center]]. She was the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], and received nine honorary degrees. In 2002, Elshtain received the Frank J. Goodnow award, the highest award for distinguished service to the profession given by the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26054458_ITM |title=New Members Join Humanities Endowment's National Council |date=November 15, 2006|publisher= [[The America's Intelligence Wire]]|access-date= 2009-10-22}}</ref>

The focus of Elshtain's work is an exploration of the relationship between politics and ethics. Much of her work concerned the parallel development of male and female [[gender roles]] as they pertain to public and private social participation. After the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] she was one of the more visible academic supporters of [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|US military intervention in Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]].<ref>News report in September/October 2013 issue of [[Philosophy Now]] magazine entitled 'Jean Bethke Elshtein' (sic), accessible [http://philosophynow.org/issues/98/News_September_October_2013 here]</ref>

She published over five hundred essays and authored and/or edited over twenty books, including ''Democracy on Trial'', ''Just War Against Terror: The Burden of American Power in a Violent World'', ''Jane Addams and the Dream of American Democracy'', ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'', and ''Sovereignty: God, State, Self''.

In 2006, she was appointed by US President [[George W. Bush]] to the Council of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and also delivered the prestigious [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], joining such previous Gifford Lecturers as [[William James]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Barth]], and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]. In 2008, Elshtain received a second presidential appointment to the [[President's Council on Bioethics]].

Elshtain contributed to national debates on the family, the roles of men and women, the state of American democracy, and international relations for more than thirty-five years.

====Analysis of major works====
Elshtain's importance to the United States stems both from her impact in political ethics, and also her position in society as a woman. Carlin Romano, author of ''America the Philosophical'', explains in his work that Elshtain's aim "was not so much to lobby for specific policies as to push for good civic-minded 'individualism' over the egoism of 'bad individualism'".{{Sfn | Romano | 2013 | p = 432}}

In one of her more popular titles, ''Women and War'', Elshtain examines women's roles in war as contrasted against masculine roles and why these concepts are important to society.{{Sfn | Elshtain | 1995b | pp = xi–xii}}  Beginning by examining America's societal interpretations of gender roles during wartime (man as a brave fighter and woman as a pacifist), Elshtain argues that men may make poor civic soldiers due to the fact that they are predisposed to a dangerous kind of eager adolescence on the battlefield, while women may be enthusiastically patriotic and possess a kind of necessary maturity, which is vital to successful combat.{{Sfn | Elshtain | 1995b | pp = xi–xii}}

In one of her more famous works, ''Democracy on Trial'', Elshtain reflects on democracy in America, discussing how socio-cultural insistence on "difference" or "separatism" have evolved since the ratification of the Constitution, and how it may be detrimental to the system.{{Sfn | Romano | 2012 | pp = 431–33}}  Elshtain does not deny the importance of difference, especially within a civic body. Rather, she recognizes that Americans are no longer acting as representative bodies in governments, which embrace separate interests and also work as a collective towards the betterment of the whole.{{Sfn | Elshtain | 1995a | pp = 65–66}}  Elshtain, like [[James Madison]], explains that American factional hostility is only a detriment to society: "one makes war with enemies: one does politics – democratic politics – with opponents".{{Sfn | Elshtain | 1995a | p = 68}}

===Death===
She died on August 11, 2013, at the age of 72 of heart failure resulting from [[endocarditis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/2-prominent-scholars-jean-elshtain-and-pauline-maier-have-died/64569|title=2 Prominent Scholars, Jean Elshtain and Pauline Maier, Have Died|first=Charles|last=Huckabee|date=13 August 2013|website=Chronicle.com|access-date=9 September 2017}}</ref> She was buried at [[Grandview Cemetery, Fort Collins]].<ref>[https://vgi.fairfield.edu/biographies/elshtain-jean-bethke Volga German Institute]</ref>
