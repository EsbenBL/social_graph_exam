==History==
{{see also|List of presidents of the University of Tulsa}}

===Frontier Origins===
The Presbyterian School for Girls (also known as "Minerva Home")<ref name="EOHC-MuskogeeCo">Mullins, Jonita. ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''. "Muskogee County." Retrieved April 22, 2013.</ref> was founded in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], [[Indian Territory]], in 1882 to offer a primary education to young women of the [[Creek Nation]].<ref name=history>[https://utulsa.edu/about/history-traditions/ History page]</ref>

In 1894, the young school expanded to become Henry Kendall College, named in honor of Reverend Henry Kendall, secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions.<ref name = "Logsdon. History">Logsdon, Guy William. "The University of Tulsa: a history from 1882–1972."  Norman, Okla.; 1975.</ref><ref name = "Delfraisse History">Delfraisse, Betty Dew. "The history of the University of Tulsa." Austin, Tex.: [S.l.], 1929.</ref> The first president was [[William A. Caldwell]], who served a brief two-year term, which ended in 1896.

Caldwell was succeeded by William Robert King, a Presbyterian minister and co-founder of the college, who had come to Oklahoma from [[Tennessee]], by way of the [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]] (affiliated with [[Columbia University]]). Kendall College, while still in Muskogee, granted the first post-secondary degree in Oklahoma in June 1898.<ref name="OHC-Muskogee">{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/M/MU018.html|title=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture: Muskogee|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615184436/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/M/MU018.html|archive-date=June 15, 2010|access-date=February 16, 2011}}</ref>  Under King, the college was moved from its original location in downtown Muskogee to a larger campus on lands donated by [[Creek Nation]] Chief [[Pleasant Porter]].

Kendall College students, faculty and administrators were instrumental in efforts to get the [[State of Sequoyah]] recognized; they wrote most of the proposed constitution and designed the seal among other things.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Junior League of Tulsa|title=Interview with Guy Logsdon|url=http://cdm15020.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15020coll10/id/272|publisher=Tulsa City-County Library|access-date=August 2, 2017|date=February 7, 1980|archive-date=July 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716194701/http://cdm15020.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15020coll10/id/272|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The opening of the new campus coincided with the start of the tenure of the third president, [[A. Grant Evans]].  Over the next ten years, Evans oversaw the struggling school's growth. In most years, class sizes remained small and although the Academy, the attached elementary, middle, and high school was more successful; by the end of the 1906/07 year Kendall College had had only 27 collegiate graduates. At the request of the administration, the Synod of Indian Territory assumed control as trustees and began to look at alternatives for the future of the school. When the administration was approached by the comparatively smaller town of Tulsa and offered a chance to move, the decision was made to relocate.<ref name="Logsdon.

===Relocation to Tulsa===
The Tulsa Commercial Club (a forerunner of the Tulsa Chamber of Commerce) decided to bid for the college. Club members who packaged a bid in 1907 to move the college to Tulsa included: B. Betters, H. O. McClure, L. N. Butts, W. L. North, [[J. M. Hall|James H. Hall (''sic'')]], Grant C. Stebbins, Rev. [[Charles William Kerr|Charles W. Kerr]], C. H. Nicholson. The offer included $100,000, 20 acres of real estate and a guarantee for utilities and street car service.<ref name="TU">[https://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU/profiles-from-tu-early-history/tulsa-commerical-club-had-a-hunch-and-bet-a-bunch.aspx The University of Tulsa, "Tulsa Commercial Club 'had a hunch and bet a bunch.'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416210718/https://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU/profiles-from-tu-early-history/tulsa-commerical-club-had-a-hunch-and-bet-a-bunch.aspx |date=April 16, 2014 }}</ref>

The college opened to thirty-five students in September 1907, two months before Oklahoma became a state. These first students attended classes at the [[First Presbyterian Church (Tulsa)|First Presbyterian Church]] until permanent buildings could be erected on the new campus. This became the start of higher education in Tulsa. Kendall Hall, the first building of the new school, was completed in 1908<ref name="Logsdon. History"/><ref name="Delfraisse History"/><ref name="Henry Kendall College Bulletin"/> and was quickly followed by two other buildings. All three buildings have since been demolished, with Kendall the last to be razed in 1972.<ref>Campbell, Joshua. "TU’s history highlights change." ''The Collegian''. October 16, 2007. Retrieved August 27, 2011.{{cite web |url=http://www.utulsa.edu/collegian/article.asp?article=3450 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 27, 2011|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319223219/http://www.utulsa.edu/collegian/article.asp?article=3450 |archive-date=March 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The bell that once hung in the Kendall Building tower was saved and displayed in Bayless Plaza.

The Kendall College presidents during 1907–1919 were Arthur Grant Evans, Levi Harrison Beeler, Seth Reed Gordon, Frederick William Hawley, Ralph J. Lamb, Charles Evans, James G. McMurtry and Arthur L. Odell.<ref name = "TUAlumni 1907-1919">[http://www.tualumni.com/s/1174/index.aspx?sid=1174&gid=1&pgid=381 TUAlumni 1907–1919]</ref>

In 1918, the Methodist Church proposed building a college in Tulsa, using money donated by Tulsa oilman [[Robert M. McFarlin]]. The proposed college was to be named McFarlin College. However, it was soon apparent that Tulsa could not yet support two competing schools. In 1920, Henry Kendall College merged with the proposed McFarlin College to become The University of Tulsa. The McFarlin Library of TU was named for the principal donor of the proposed college. The name of Henry Kendall has lived on to the present as the Kendall College of Arts and Sciences.

===20th century===
The University of Tulsa opened its School of Petroleum Engineering in 1928.<ref name="TU-History">[http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU.aspx .Tulsa University Website "History of TU." Accessed February 24, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317033428/http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU.aspx |date=March 17, 2011 }}</ref>

The [[Great Depression]] hit the university hard. By 1935, the school was about to close because of its poor financial condition. It had a debt of $250,000, enrollment had fallen to 300 students (including many who could not pay their own tuition), the faculty was poorly paid and morale was low. It was then that the oil tycoon and TU-patron [[Waite Phillips]] offered the school presidency to Clarence Isaiah ("Cy") Pontius, a former investment banker. His primary focus would be to rescue the school's finances. A deans' council would take charge of academic issues.<ref name="TW19980112">Scott Cooper, "Pontius Pilot", Tulsa World, January 12, 1998.</ref>

However, Pontius' accomplishments went beyond raising money. During his tenure the following events occurred:
*In 1935, the university opened the College of Business Administration, which it renamed as the Collins College of Business Administration in 2008.<ref name = "TU-History" />
*The Tulsa Law School, located in downtown Tulsa, became part of the university in 1943.<ref name = "TU-History" />
*In 1948, oil magnate [[William Skelly|William G. Skelly]] donated funds to found the University radio station, KWGS (named for his initials).

[[File:Skellylg.jpg|thumb|Skelly House, one-time official residence for the President of the University of Tulsa]]
After William G. Skelly died, his widow donated the Skelly Mansion, at the corner of 21st Street and Madison Avenue, to the University of Tulsa. The school sold the mansion and its furnishings to private owners in 1959. On July 5, 2012, the university announced that it would repurchase the house as a residence for its president.

In 1958, [[Ben Graf Henneke]], a scholar of theater and communications, became the first alumnus to hold the Presidency of the University of Tulsa.  During his tenure the university established new doctoral programs, increased the proportion of faculty with doctorates, started new publications including ''Petroleum Abstracts'' and the ''[[James Joyce Quarterly]]'', developed a North Campus center for [[petroleum engineering]] research, and expanded many main campus facilities. He was succeeded by Dr. Eugene L. Swearingen, a [[Stanford University]]-trained economist and Oklahoma native who served on the National Finance Committee for the [[Jimmy Carter]] Presidential Campaign.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-TU chief, banker Swearingen, 82, dead|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/ex-tu-chief-banker-swearingen-dead/article_9a6a5799-f96c-57b0-888b-967114d79043.html|access-date=July 12, 2016|newspaper=Tulsa World}}</ref>  Swearingen increased TU's endowment and expanded the footprint of its campus.

===21st century===
In 2004, anthropologist [[Steadman Upham]] joined the University of Tulsa as President, having served in faculty and leadership positions at the [[University of Oregon]] and [[Arizona State University]]. Within five years of his arrival, TU saw thirteen major construction projects and renovations on campus, ranging from the construction of the Roxana Rozsa and Robert Eugene Lorton Performance Center to the overhaul of Keplinger Hall, and plans for seven more major projects finalized (despite the nationwide recession).

The University also launched the Oxley College of Health Sciences, in downtown Tulsa, named in recognition of a major gift from Tulsa's Oxley Foundation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=KREHBIEL|first1=Randy|title=TU to locate Oxley College of Health Sciences downtown|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/tu-to-locate-oxley-college-of-health-sciences-downtown/article_1b550411-c412-5a85-9557-f548708ce36f.html|access-date=July 12, 2016|newspaper=Tulsa World}}</ref> The University also partnered with the George Kaiser Family Foundation to permanently house [[The Bob Dylan Archive]] at TU in 2016. Under Upham's leadership, the University of Tulsa assumed management of the famous [[Gilcrease Museum]] in northwest Tulsa.

In 2016 President Upham retired and was succeeded by Dr. Gerard Clancy who previously served as a psychiatry professor and held leadership positions at the [[University of Iowa]] and the [[University of Oklahoma]]. About two-and-a-half years into his presidency, in the spring of 2019, President Clancy and Provost Levit announced a restructuring of academic programs at the university that would eliminate several academic programs. The plan was met with resistance from some faculty who believed it was formulated without [[shared governance|adequate input]] from faculty. Although faculty members voted "[[no confidence]]" in the president and provost in November, the university's board of trustees publicly affirmed their support of the plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-Radical-Restructuring/247542 |title=How a Radical Restructuring Plan Fractured a Campus and Fueled a No-Confidence Vote |first=Lauren |last=Fisher |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=November 14, 2019 |access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref>

In January 2020, President Clancy informed the Board that he needed to cut back his activities because of unspecified medical issues. The Board named Provost Levit as Interim President of the school, effective in January 2020. {{efn|Dr. Levit thus became the first woman, and second TU alum, to lead the school in its history.}}

==Campus==<!-- This section is linked from [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] -->
The campus of the University of Tulsa centers on a wide, grassy, quad-like space known as Dietler Commons, formerly called "The U." The predominant architectural style is English Gothic. Most of the buildings are constructed from tan and rose-colored Crab Orchard [[sandstone]] from [[Tennessee]] interspersed with stone quarried in [[Arkansas]]. Other materials include Bedford [[limestone]] from [[Indiana]] and [[slate]] quarried in [[Vermont]]. The university's campus borders Tulsa's Kendall-Whittier neighborhood and is not far from Tulsa's downtown and mid-town neighborhoods.  The campus, in particular its football venue Skelly Field, is located on the historic [[U.S. Route 66]], America's "Mother Road" stretching from [[Chicago]] to [[Los Angeles]].

University of Tulsa has participated in efforts towards sustainability including RecycleMania and Adopt a Recycle Bin. Many campus efforts have been led by student groups like the Sustainability Committee, the Association of International Students, Student Association, TU Earth Matters, and the TU Food Garden. The university strives to have its buildings meet LEED standards in order to reduce the school's overall carbon footprint.

'''McFarlin Library: Resources and Notable Collections'''

At the top of Deitler Commons sits one of the campus' most notable landmarks, the McFarlin Library, named after Robert and Ida McFarlin, the library's primary benefactors. The McFarlins had only one stipulation with their gift: that the view of Downtown Tulsa from McFarlin could never be blocked. Groundbreaking ceremonies took place on May 3, 1929 and the edifice was dedicated on June 1, 1930. The library continued to grow over the years, adding a five-story addition in 1967, an underground stacks area in by 1979, and technology wing in 2007.  The library contains over two million items.

Currently, the library's Department of Special Collections and University Archives houses over twelve million archival items and has over a thousand collections on a wide-ranging array of topics including 20th-century [[British literature|British]], [[Irish literature|Irish]], and [[American literature]], which includes the world's second largest collection of materials by [[James Joyce]]. It also houses the papers of [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[V.S. Naipaul]] and [[Doris Lessing]], as well as novelists and poets [[Jean Rhys]], [[Eliot Bliss]], [[David Plante]], [[Anna Kavan]], and [[Stevie Smith]], just to name a few. In addition to these famous novelists, McFarlin Library's houses the papers of Congresswoman [[Alice Mary Robertson]], literary critic [[Richard Ellmann]], comic book innovator [[E. Nelson Bridwell]], Cherokee Principal Chief [[J.B. Milam]], and writer/sexologist [[Edward Charles]], among others.

In addition to traditional campus events, Student Association provides smaller campus programs including community service activities, social awareness events, and diversity programming. Activities organized by Student Association are free to all TU students.

* '''Homecoming Bonfire''': Traditionally held the Friday evening prior to the Homecoming football game. The Homecoming court is honored along with the Jess Chouteau Top Ten Seniors.
* '''Alma Mater''': "Hail to Tulsa U" is sung by alumni and current students prior to major sporting events and at the end of all commencement ceremonies. Alumni and students remain standing as a sign of respect. The melody is played by the Sharp Chapel carillon daily at 5 pm.
