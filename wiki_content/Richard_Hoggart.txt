'''Herbert Richard Hoggart''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSL}} (24 September 1918 – 10 April 2014) was a British academic whose career covered the fields of sociology, [[English literature]] and [[cultural studies]], with emphasis on British popular culture.

==Early life==
Hoggart was born in the [[Potternewton]] area of [[Leeds]], one of three children in an impoverished family. His father, Tom Longfellow Hoggart (1880–1922), the son of a boilermaker, was a regular infantry soldier and housepainter who died of [[brucellosis]] when Hoggart was a year old, and his mother Adeline died of a chest illness when he was eight.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Collini |first1=Stefan |title=Hoggart, (Herbert) Richard |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.108538 |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |access-date=15 April 2021}}</ref> He grew up with his grandmother in [[Hunslet]], and was encouraged in his education by an aunt. Emulating his elder brother, Tom, the first of the family to go to a grammar school,<ref name="guardian obit">{{cite news |last1=Ezard |first1=John |title=Richard Hoggart obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/10/richard-hoggart |access-date=15 April 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=10 April 2014}}</ref> he gained a place at [[Cockburn High School]] which was a [[grammar school]], after his headmaster requested that the education authority reread his scholarship examination essay. He then won a scholarship to study English at the [[University of Leeds]], where he graduated with a first class degree.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news |title=Richard Hoggart Obituary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10760334/Richard-Hoggart-obituary.html |access-date=15 April 2021 |work=The Telegraph |date=11 April 2014}}</ref> He served with the [[Royal Artillery]] during [[World War II]] and was discharged as a staff captain.<ref name="guardian obit"/>

==Career==
He was a staff tutor at the [[University of Hull]] from 1946 to 1959, and published his first book, a study of [[W. H. Auden]]'s poetry, in 1951. His major work, ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'', was published in 1957. Partly autobiography, the volume was interpreted as lamenting the loss of an authentic working class popular culture in Britain, and denouncing the imposition of a mass culture through advertising, media and Americanisation.

He became Senior Lecturer in English at the [[University of Leicester]] from 1959 to 1962. Hoggart was an expert witness at the [[R v Penguin Books Ltd.|Lady Chatterley trial]] in 1960, and his argument that it was an essentially moral and "puritan" work, which merely repeated words he had heard on a building site on his way to the court,<ref name="Hartley">Hartley, J. (2009). ''The Uses of Digital Literacy''. St. Lucia: University of Queensland Press. p. 2</ref> is sometimes viewed as having had a decisive influence on the outcome of the trial.

While Professor of English at [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham University]] between 1962 and 1973, he founded the institution's [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] in 1964 and was its director until 1969. Hoggart was Assistant Director-General of [[UNESCO]] (1971–1975) and finally Warden of [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] (1976–1984), after which he retired from formal academic life. The Main Building at Goldsmiths has now been renamed the "Richard Hoggart Building" in tribute to his contributions to the college.

Hoggart was a member of numerous public bodies and committees, including the [[Albermarle Committee on Youth Services]] (1958–1960), the [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting]] (1960–1962), the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] (1976–1981) and the [[Statesman and Nation Publishing Company Ltd]] (1977–1981). He was also Chairman of the Advisory Council for Adult and [[Continuing Education]] (1977–1983), and the [[Broadcasting Research Unit]] (1981–1991), as well as a Governor of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (1962–1988).

In later works, such as ''The Way We Live Now'' (1995), he regretted the decline in [[moral authority]] that he held religion once provided. He also attacked contemporary education for its emphasis on the vocational, and [[cultural relativism]] for its tendency to concentrate on the popular and meretricious.

==Personal life==
One of his two sons was the political journalist [[Simon Hoggart]], who predeceased him by three months,<ref name=SimonHoggart>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/10/simon-hoggart-dad-working-socialising-laughing | work=The Guardian | title=Simon Hoggart, my dad, was working, socialising and laughing to the end | date=10 January 2014 | location=London | first=Amy | last=Hoggart|access-date=11 January 2014}}</ref> and the other is the television critic [[Paul Hoggart]]. He was also survived by a daughter, Nicola. In ''[[The Chatterley Affair]]'', a 2006 dramatisation of the 1960 trial made for the [[digital television]] channel [[BBC Four]], he was played by actor [[David Tennant]].

==Death==
In later life he suffered from dementia.<ref name=SimonHoggart /> He died at a nursing home in London on 10 April 2014, aged 95.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/10/richard-hoggart-died-long-illness|title = Richard Hoggart has died at the age of 95 after a long illness|work = [[The Guardian]]|date = 10 April 2014|accessdate = 12 August 2021|last = Kettle|first = Martin}}</ref>
