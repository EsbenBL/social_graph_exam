'''Stevi Jackson''' (born 23 June 1951),<ref name=Congress>{{cite web |title= Jackson, Stevi |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79006916.html |publisher= Library of Congress |access-date= 10 July 2014 |quote= (Stevi Jackson, born 23 June 1951)}}</ref> is an academic and writer working in the field of gender and sexuality. She has been Professor of [[Women's studies]] at the [[University of York |University of York, England]] since 1998,<ref name="University of York, 2014">University of York, 2014</ref> and is Director of the University's Centre for Women's Studies.

== Education ==
Stevi Jackson earned her degree in Sociology from the [[University of Kent]] in 1972. In 1973 she gained her Masters from the [[University of York]].<ref name="University of York, 2014"/>

== Writings ==
She has been writing on feminist topics since 1973, and describes her research as an attempt to explain and theorise her own experience of being a heterosexual woman.<ref>Jackson, 1999c: 1</ref> She explicitly states throughout her work that she is a heterosexual feminist working within a materialist framework. Jackson has been politically active throughout her life, particularly in the 1970s when she engaged in [[consciousness raising]] groups, went to national conferences and helped to set up Rape Crisis in Cardiff. During the [[Thatcherism|Thatcher years]], she joined [[Labour Party (UK)|the Labour party]] to counter the damage she saw being done by the government. She says Labour was “a good base for feminist campaigning”.<ref name="Jackson, 2009a">Jackson, 2009a</ref> In the 1980s, she shied away from action during the "sex wars" which attacked heterosexual feminists for fraternising with the "enemy".<ref>Jackson and Scott, 1996: 11</ref> She found this period destructive for [[feminism]] and as a heterosexual feminist, preferred to stay out of the debates on the issue. Recently, her political action has involved trying to keep women's studies alive as a space for women to explore feminism but regrets that rising higher in academia leaves less time for feminist action.<ref name="Jackson, 2009a"/> She believes it is important to build a bridge between [[feminist theory]] and practice which is why she particularly enjoyed writing for [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] magazine ''Trouble and Strife''.<ref name="Jackson, 2009a">Jackson, 2009a</ref> Jackson's [[utopia]] is an egalitarian world without gender where “your genitals matter as little as your hair colour”.<ref name="Jackson, 2009a"/> A world where marriage is abolished and those who wish to commit to one another engage in civil partnerships. She advocates a collective model of [[Parenting|child rearing]] and believes that heterosexual, monogamous couples are not necessarily the best parents.<ref name="Jackson, 2009a">Jackson, 2009a</ref>
