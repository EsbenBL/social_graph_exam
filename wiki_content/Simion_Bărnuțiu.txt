'''Simion Bărnuțiu''' ({{IPA-ro|simiˈon bərˈnut͡sju}}; 21 July 1808 – 28 May 1864) was a [[Transylvania]]n, later [[Romania]]n historian, academic, philosopher, jurist, and [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] politician. A leader of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 revolutionary movement of Transylvanian Romanians]], he represented its [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Eastern Rite Catholic]] wing. Bărnuțiu lived for a large part of his life in [[Moldavia]], and was for long a professor of philosophy at [[Academia Mihăileană]] and at the [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|University of Iași]].

== Biography ==

=== Early activities ===
He was born in [[Bocșa, Sălaj|Bocșa]] ({{lang-hu|Oláhbaksa}}), [[Szilágy County]], Transylvania (now in [[Sălaj County]], Romania). He became a teacher of history at the secondary school in [[Blaj]], which was at the time, like the rest of Transylvania, part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. Bărnuțiu was influenced early-on by the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] (''[[Kantianism]]''), in which he saw the means to reform society in opposition to traditional [[Theology|theological]] views, while supporting a presence of [[laity]] in the administrative structures of his own church.<ref>Hitchins, pp. 271, 277</ref> An active contributor to ''[[Foaie pentru minte, inimă şi literatură|Foaie pentru minte, inimă și literatură]]'', the literary supplement of [[George Bariț]]'s journal ''[[Gazeta de Transilvania]]'', he became noted after 1842 for virulently opposing the decision of the [[Magyars|Magyar]]-dominated [[Transylvanian Diet]] to give [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] a status of a semi-official language in local administration of Transylvania(''see [[History of Transylvania]]'').<ref>Hitchins, p. 275</ref>

On 24 March 1848, Bărnuțiu issued one in a series of appeals by various authors, calling for [[self-determination]] of [[Romanians]] inside Transylvania, viewing it as a necessary step in matching Magyar success in obtaining rights from [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]], and professing that Romanians should reject the projected union of the region with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until ensured [[proportional representation]] and the official condemnation of [[serfdom]].<ref>Hitchins, pp. 311–312</ref>

=== Blaj Assemblies and National Committee ===
The [[Blaj Assemblies|Blaj Assembly]] convened in April on the basis of such proclamations gathered together intellectuals, clergy, and commoners.

Bărnuțiu gave several speeches in front of the Assembly, calling for patience and moderation while continuing to campaign against all unilateral change in Transylvania's government and disagreeing with more skeptical political leaders, such as Bariț and [[Andrei Șaguna]], and finally being persuaded to include an oath of allegiance to the Emperor in his political strategy.<ref>Hitchins, pp. 312-313</ref> Just before the Second Assembly in May, he agreed to moderate his tone further, taking in view the points made by Bariț in regard to the fragile situation facing Romanians in the region, and partly reformulated his program on self-determination.<ref>Hitchins, p. 315</ref> On 17 May, he was elected vicepresident of the ''Permanent Committee'' formed by Blaj delegates as a supervising body (one presided by Șaguna), later the basis of the ''National Romanian Committee''.<ref>Hitchins, p. 316</ref>

The rapid succession of events after the proclamation of Transylvania's union with the Hungarian Kingdom (11 July) and of [[Hungary]]'s independence (27 September), with an Austrian military debacle in Transylvania, saw a rapprochement between the loyalist Austrian [[Anton Freiherr von Puchner]], nominal governor of the region, and Bărnuțiu's Committee. From the committee's perspective, this was an Austrian recognition of Transylvania's self-government as a Romanian region, which was to be advanced to the new emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]].<ref>Hitchins, p. 319</ref>

=== In Moldavia and Romania ===
After [[Imperial Russia]]n intervention in Transylvania, he decided to go into exile, and settled in [[Iaşi|Iași]], Moldavia's capital. He wrote several treaties on law and philosophy (including a passionate defense of [[Roman law]]),<ref>Panu, p. 16</ref> and, before and after the union of the [[Danubian Principalities]] under ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] advocated [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] reforms which were a direct inspiration to the Moldavian liberal dissidents grouped as ''[[Fracţiunea liberă şi independentă|Fracțiunea liberă și independentă]]''.<ref>Ornea, in Panu, p. VI</ref> In the 1850s, Bărnuțiu wrote against the popular project of electing a foreign prince as ruler of the Principalities, an opposition which ''Fracțiunea'' carried into the [[Parliament of Romania|Constituent Assembly]] following the toppling of Cuza two years after Bărnuțiu's death.<ref>Panu, pp. 16–17</ref> ''[[Junimea]]'', a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[literary society]] created during that period, criticized him along with other Transylvanian intellectuals (such as [[Timotei Cipariu]], [[Gheorghe Şincai|Gheorghe Șincai]], and [[August Treboniu Laurian]]) for having supported a [[Romanian grammar]] and [[Romanian alphabet|alphabet]] based on [[Latin]] etymologies instead of one reflecting the spoken language (at the time, "Latinist" influences following Transylvanian guidelines had come to be favoured by the [[Romanian Academy]]).<ref>Panu, pp. 142–143, 321, 493</ref>

After having fallen gravely ill, Simion Bărnuțiu asked to be allowed to return to his native village. He died on the way there, in [[Hida, Sălaj|Hida]].
