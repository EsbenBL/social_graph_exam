===Renaissance period===
[[File:John Speed's map of Oxford, 1605..jpg|thumb|In 1605 Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).]]
The new learning of the [[Renaissance]] greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were [[William Grocyn]], who contributed to the revival of [[Greek language]] studies, and [[John Colet]], the noted [[Biblical Theology|biblical scholar]].

With the [[English Reformation]] and the breaking of communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Recusancy|recusant]] scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the [[University of Douai]].<ref>"Early Modern Ireland, 1534–1691", editors: T.

As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.

In 1636,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/field/field_document/University%20Statutes%20August%202012%20-%20July%202013.pdf|title=Statutes of the University of Oxford, 2012–13|access-date=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222164356/https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/field/field_document/University%20Statutes%20August%202012%20-%20July%202013.pdf|archive-date=22 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[William Laud]], the chancellor and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], codified the university's statutes.

Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the [[Oxford University Press|University Press]], and he made significant contributions to the [[Bodleian Library]], the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the [[Church of England]] as the [[established church]] until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and "[[dissenter]]s" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.<ref>{{cite web |title=Universities Tests Act 1871 |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/34-35/26 |access-date=30 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101193831/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/34-35/26 |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The university was a centre of the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] party during the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] cause.<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil War: Surrender of Oxford|url=http://oxonblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/civil_war.html|work=Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Scheme|publisher=Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board|year=2013|access-date=30 December 2015}}</ref> From the mid-18th century onwards, however, the university took little part in political conflicts.

[[Wadham College]], founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]]. Wren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the [[Oxford Philosophical Club]], which included [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Robert Hooke]]. This group held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, [[John Wilkins]], and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the [[Royal Society]].

===Modern period===
====Students====
Before reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. [[Spencer Walpole|Sir Spencer Walpole]], a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, "Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career." He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: "The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry."<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870–1875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|year=1903|pages=136–37|access-date=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304050530/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|archive-date=4 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, Walpole argued:
{{Quote | style=font-size:100%; | Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.<ref>Walpole [https://archive.org/details/cu31924088010115/page/n163 ''History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 3: 1870–1875'' p.140]</ref>|sign=|source=}}

Out of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).<ref>[[William D.

M.&nbsp;C. Curthoys and H.&nbsp;S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]], [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/0046760950240403|title = Oxford athleticism, 1850‐1914: A reappraisal|journal = History of Education|volume = 24|issue = 4|pages = 305–317|year = 1995|last1 = Curthoys|first1 = M.

All students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on [[classical language]]s. [[Science]] students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with [[Greek language]] study removed from their required courses. This concept of a [[Bachelor of Science]] had been adopted at other European universities ([[London University]] had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the "natural science preliminary" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDAWHbXgi4C&pg=PA355 The history of the University of Oxford: Nineteenth-century Oxford, Volumes 6–7]'', page 355.</ref>

At the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=History of the University of Oxford: Volume VIII: The Twentieth Century – Oxford Scholarship|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001|year=1994|isbn=978-0-19-822974-2|last1=Harrison|first1=Brian|last2=Aston|first2=Trevor Henry}}</ref> The [[iarchive:oxforduniversity00univuoft|University Roll of Service]] records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford university roll of service: University of Oxford: Free Download & Streaming|url=https://archive.org/details/oxforduniversity00univuoft|website=Internet Archive|access-date=10 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311003438/https://archive.org/details/oxforduniversity00univuoft|archive-date=11 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'.

====Reforms====
Two parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. [[Archibald Campbell Tait]], former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870–1875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|year=1903|pages=145–51|access-date=4 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305090139/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4127167|title = Oxford and the Idea of a University in Nineteenth-Century Britain|journal = Oxford Review of Education|volume = 30|issue = 4|pages = 575–592|last1 = Goldman|first1 = Lawrence|year = 2004}}</ref>

The system of separate [[Honour Moderations|honour schools]] for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and [[Literae Humaniores]].<ref name="boase"/> Schools of "Natural Sciences" and "Law, and Modern History" were added in 1853.<ref name="boase">{{cite book |pages=208–209 |last=Boase |first=Charles William |author-link=Charles William Boase |year=1887 |title=Oxford |edition=2nd |url=http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/743404c6bb6c4b16880e9dfce4000622 |access-date=3 February 2013}}</ref> By 1872, the last of these had split into "Jurisprudence" and "Modern History".

The mid-19th century saw the impact of the [[Oxford Movement]] (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]]. The influence of the reformed model of German universities reached Oxford via key scholars such as [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], [[Benjamin Jowett]] and [[Max Müller]].

Administrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for [[English Dissenters|religious dissent]], and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of [[Ancient Greek]] was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.

The University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.<ref>John Aldrich – [http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/Doc1.htm "The Maths PhD in the UK: Notes on its History – Economics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103452/http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/Doc1.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>

The mid-20th century saw many distinguished continental scholars, displaced by [[Nazism]] and communism, relocating to Oxford.

The list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2020, 72 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.<ref name="Famous"/>

The university is a "city university" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The [[Science Area, Oxford|Science Area]], in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.

Iconic university buildings include the [[Radcliffe Camera]], the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the [[Examination Schools]], where examinations and some lectures take place. The [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]] uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.

In 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400m × 25m) [[Castle Mill]] development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking [[Cripley Meadow]] and the historic [[Port Meadow]], blocking views of the spires in the city centre.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/9912968/Philip-Pullman-campaigns-for-demolition-of-brutal-new-Oxford-University-buildings.html | title=Philip Pullman condemns Port Meadow buildings | first=Gordon | last=Rayner | date=6 March 2013 | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | access-date=18 April 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309121431/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/9912968/Philip-Pullman-campaigns-for-demolition-of-brutal-new-Oxford-University-buildings.html | archive-date=9 March 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref> The development has been likened to building a "skyscraper beside [[Stonehenge]]".<ref>{{cite news| title=Historian takes university to task over 'visual disaster' of Port Meadow flats |first=Reg | last=Little | work=The Oxford Times| page=3 | date=7 February 2013 }}</ref>

The [[University Parks]] are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]], [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] and [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]]. It is open to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.

The [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] is the oldest [[botanical garden|botanic garden]] in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on {{convert|1.8|ha|acre|frac=2|abbr=on}}. It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families.

==Organisation== <!-- "s" spelling per talk page consensus on 20 April 2009 -->
{{See also|Category:Departments of the University of Oxford}}
As a [[collegiate university]], Oxford is structured as a federation, comprising over forty self-governing [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] and [[Permanent private hall|halls]], along with a central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]].

Academic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.

Colleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., [[Nuffield College]] as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the [[Bodleian]]), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).

===Central governance===
The university's formal head is the [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]]{{anchor|Chancellor of the University of Oxford}}, currently [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten of Barnes]], though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of [[Convocation]], a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7kUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA24|title=The Oxford University Calendar 1817|date=24 June 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>

[[File:Wellington Square Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wellington Square, Oxford|Wellington Square]], the name of which has become synonymous with the university's central administration]]
The [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]], currently [[Louise Richardson]],<ref name="VCapproval"/><ref name="NewVCLouiseRichardson"/> is the ''de facto'' head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the vice-chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], in addition to observers from the [[OUSU|students' union]]. Congregation, the "parliament of the dons", comprises over 3,700 members of the university's academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.

Two university [[Proctor of the University of Oxford|proctors]], elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.proctors.ox.ac.uk/ |title=The Proctors' Office |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=University of Oxford |access-date=26 December 2020 }}</ref> The university's professors are collectively referred to as the [[List of professorships at the University of Oxford|Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford]]. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the [[Chichele Professorship]]s and the [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]]. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four [[Divisions of the University of Oxford|divisions]], each with its own head and elected board. They are the Humanities Division; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.

The University of Oxford is a "public university" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a "private university" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.<ref name="OXCHEPS39">{{cite web | url = http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf | title = OFFA and £6000–9000 tuition fees | access-date = 20 March 2011 | last1 = Dennis | first1 = Farrington | first2 = David | last2 = Palfreyman | date = 21 February 2011 | work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39 | publisher = Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies | quote = Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College).

Universities are not part of the State and they are not part of the public sector; Government has no reserve powers of intervention even in a failing institution. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721195554/http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf | archive-date = 21 July 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref>

To be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine [[colleges of the University of Oxford]] (including [[Reuben College, Oxford|Reuben College]], planned to admit students in 2021)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/organisation/future-projects-parks-college|title=Parks College|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=1 December 2019}}</ref> and six [[permanent private hall]]s (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.<ref name=CollegesandHalls>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/colleges/colleges_and_halls_az/index.html|title=Colleges and Halls A-Z|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=4 October 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61CYHOoiD?url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/colleges/colleges_and_halls_az/index.html|archive-date=25 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.

The permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the [[Oxford fellow|fellows]] of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The six current PPHs are:

The PPHs and colleges join together as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.confcoll.ox.ac.uk/ |title=Conference of Colleges |publisher=Confcoll.ox.ac.uk |access-date=16 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913052216/http://www.confcoll.ox.ac.uk/ |archive-date=13 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/test1-conf-coll/Public%20Documents/conf_coll_leaflet_web%20final.pdf |title=Who we are, what we do – The Conference of Colleges |publisher=Oxford University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022010939/https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/test1-conf-coll/Public%20Documents/conf_coll_leaflet_web%20final.pdf |archive-date=22 October 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the [[Oliver Franks, Baron Franks|Franks]] Commission in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/councilsec/gov/gov_expl/ |title=A brief history and overview of the university's governance arrangements (see footnote 1) |publisher=Admin.ox.ac.uk |access-date=16 August 2013 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804172404/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/councilsec/gov/gov_expl/ |archive-date=4 August 2013 }}</ref>

Teaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as [[university dons|dons]], although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. There is no common title for the heads of colleges: the titles used include Warden, Provost, Principal, President, Rector, Master and Dean.

Most applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges, which work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do I choose a college? – Will I be interviewed only at my chosen college?|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/colleges/how_do_i_choose_a_college/index.html|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=23 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110064825/http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/colleges/how_do_i_choose_a_college/index.html|archive-date=10 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.

Offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make "open offers" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until [[A Level]] results day in August.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Offer Scheme |url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=462 |publisher=Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford |access-date=23 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606054422/http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=462 |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Open Offer Scheme |url=http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduates/faqs/faq-admissions |publisher=Department of Physics, University of Oxford |access-date=27 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707214158/http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduates/faqs/faq-admissions |archive-date=7 July 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Teaching and degrees=== <!-- there is much more to say about research than is currently stated-->
{{Main|Degrees of the University of Oxford|List of professorships at the University of Oxford|Undergraduate education at University of Oxford}}
Undergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]], [[Hilary term|Hilary]] and [[Trinity term|Trinity]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulations on the number and length of terms |work=University of Oxford |url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/03-00_REGULATIONS_ON_THE_NUMBER_AND_LENGTH_OF_TERMS.shtml |access-date=9 October 2007 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527150600/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/03-00_REGULATIONS_ON_THE_NUMBER_AND_LENGTH_OF_TERMS.shtml |archive-date=27 May 2008 }}</ref> (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as "first week", the last as "eighth week" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example "noughth week" precedes term).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/working-at-oxford/new-to-the-university/university-year-and-events |title=University Year and Events |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Staff Gateway |publisher=University of Oxford |access-date=22 April 2021 |quote=}}</ref> Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hepi.ac.uk/files/33TheacademicexperienceofstudentsinEnglishuniversities2007.pdf |title=The Academic Experience of Students in English Universities (2007 report) |publisher=Higher Education Policy Institute |last1=Sastry |first1=Tom |last2=Bekhradnia |first2=Bahram |date=25 September 2007 |pages=footnote 14 |access-date=4 November 2007 |quote=Even within Russell Group institutions, it is remarkable how consistently Oxford and Cambridge appear to require more effort of their students than other universities.

However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).

Research degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.

===Scholarships and financial support===
[[File:Rhodes House Oxford 20040909.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rhodes House]] – home to the awarding body for the [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s, often considered to be the world's most prestigious scholarship]]
There are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Oxford targets bright young things of eastern Europe |work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/mar/22/highereducation.internationaleducationnews |date=22 March 2007 |access-date=9 October 2007 |first=Jessica |last=Shepherd |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414051743/http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/mar/22/highereducation.internationaleducationnews |archive-date=14 April 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Oxford also offers the [[Clarendon Fund|Clarendon Scholarship]] which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clarendon.ox.ac.uk/informationforapplicants/eligibility/ |title=Eligibility criteria, Clarendon Fund Scholarships |publisher=Clarendon.ox.ac.uk |access-date=11 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150702/http://www.clarendon.ox.ac.uk/informationforapplicants/eligibility/ |archive-date=13 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by [[Oxford University Press]] in association with colleges and other partnership awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clarendon.ox.ac.uk/about/history/ |title=History of the Clarendon Fund, Clarendon Fund Scholarships |publisher=Clarendon.ox.ac.uk |date=1 September 2011 |access-date=11 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150925/http://www.clarendon.ox.ac.uk/about/history/ |archive-date=13 April 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clarendon.ox.ac.uk/about/partnership/ |title=Partnership awards, Clarendon Fund Scholarships |publisher=Clarendon.ox.ac.uk |access-date=11 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150734/http://www.clarendon.ox.ac.uk/about/partnership/ |archive-date=13 April 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a "[[massive open online course]]" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37975359 |title=Oxford University to launch first online 'Mooc' course |work=BBC News |date=15 November 2016 |access-date=21 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121081125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37975359 |archive-date=21 November 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The course available is called ‘From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development’.

Students successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibitions]], normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; "commoners" (originally those who had to pay for their "commons", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term "scholar" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were "noblemen commoners" and "gentlemen commoners", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. "Closed" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="Crook">{{cite book |last=Crook |first=J Mordaunt |author-link=J.

===Traditions===

[[File:Toby Virno sub fusc.JPG|thumb|upright|An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in [[subfusc]] for matriculation]]

[[Academic dress]] is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Doody and Robinson|title=Students vote overwhelmingly to retain subfusc|url=http://www.cherwell.org/news/topstories/2015/05/22/students-vote-overwhelmingly-to-retain-subfusc|website=Cherwell|date=22 May 2015|publisher=OSPL|access-date=22 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523132145/http://www.cherwell.org/news/topstories/2015/05/22/students-vote-overwhelmingly-to-retain-subfusc|archive-date=23 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote on not so much making [[subfusc]] voluntary, but rather, in effect, abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.<ref>See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/ht2006wk1/News/end_of_an_era%3A_subfusc_could_be_sent_down |title=End of an era: subfusc could be sent down - oxfordstudent.com |access-date=27 March 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308222153/http://oxfordstudent.com/ht2006wk1/News/end_of_an_era%3A_subfusc_could_be_sent_down |archive-date=8 March 2006 }}</ref> In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to [[transgender]] people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtoday.co.uk/education/40-higher-education/12099-support-for-transgender-students-taking-oxford-university-exams |title=Support for transgender students taking Oxford University exams |access-date=29 July 2012 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910005933/http://www.govtoday.co.uk/education/40-higher-education/12099-support-for-transgender-students-taking-oxford-university-exams |archive-date=10 September 2012 }}</ref>

Other traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have [[formal hall]] six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.

''Balls'' are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called [[commemoration ball]]s; the dress code is usually [[white tie]]. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually [[black tie]].

[[Punt (boat)|Punting]] is a common summer leisure activity.

There are several more or less quirky traditions peculiar to individual colleges, for example the [[Mallard Song|All Souls Mallard song]].

===Clubs and societies===
{{See also|Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford}}
[[File:Eights 2005.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Rowing at Summer Eights, an annual intercollegiate [[bumps race]]]]
Sport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as [[cuppers]] (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard [[:Category:Oxford student sports clubs|university wide groups]]. Significant focus is given to annual [[Varsity match|varsity]] matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is [[The Boat Race]], watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, [[Torpids]], and [[Summer Eights]]. A [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as [[Octopush]] and [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]].

There are two weekly student newspapers: the independent ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' and OUSU's ''[[The Oxford Student]]''. Other publications include the [[Isis magazine|''Isis'' magazine]], the satirical ''[[The Oxymoron|Oxymoron]]'', the graduate ''[[The Oxonian Review of Books|Oxonian Review]]'', and the online only newspaper ''The Oxford Blue''. The [[Campus radio|student radio]] station is [[Oxide Radio]]. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] and the [[Oxford Revue]]. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.

Most academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to students studying all courses, for example the [[Oxford University Scientific Society|Scientific Society]]. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries, and cultures.

The [[Oxford Union]] (not to be confused with the [[Oxford University Student Union]]) hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. There have historically been elite invitation-only societies such as the [[Bullingdon Club]].

===Student union and common rooms===

The [[Oxford University Student Union]], formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,<ref name="OxfordSU">{{cite news |url=http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |title="Oxford SU" to replace OUSU brand |work=[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] |date=2017-08-17 |access-date=2018-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026222839/http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.

The importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It is worth noting that JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example [[Wadham College]]'s entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.

==Notable alumni==
{{Main|List of University of Oxford people|List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Oxford}}
