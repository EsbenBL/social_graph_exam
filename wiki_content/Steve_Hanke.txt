===Water resource economics===
In 1969, Hanke began his academic career as a water resource economist in the Johns Hopkins Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering (now the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering), a department founded by famed sanitary engineer [[Abel Wolman]]. At the time, the department was known as the premier water resource engineering department in the country, and was home to world-renowned sanitary engineer John C. Geyer, with whom Hanke would frequently collaborate.<ref name=":16" />

Hanke was hired to continue the water-related research program at Johns Hopkins that began during the Geyer era. During his initial years in the department, Hanke focused on issues including water pricing and demand, benefit-cost analysis, system design, and leak detection and control.<ref name=":16" /> He produced a number of important pieces of scholarship, including the first event study of the impact of [[water meter]] installation on water use,<ref name="wiley">{{cite journal|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=October 1970|title=Demand for Water under Dynamic Conditions|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=6|issue=5|pages=1253–1261|bibcode=1970WRR.....6.1253H|doi=10.1029/WR006i005p01253}}</ref> as well as sewer interceptor design criteria which are still commonly used today in Europe.<ref name="ssrn">{{cite web|ssrn=2245733|title=Statistical Studies on Costs for Sewage Pipes by Steve H. Hanke, R. W. Wentworth :: SSRN|year=1980}}</ref>

During this time, Hanke served as the associate editor of the ''Water Resources Bulletin'' and ''Water Resources Research'', as the economics editor for ''Water Engineering and Management'', and as a member of the editorial board of ''Land Economics''.<ref name=":16" /> He was also an adviser to the French water companies [[Compagnie Générale des Eaux]] (now [[Veolia Environment]]) and Compagnie Lyonnaise des Eaux, as well as to the engineering firms Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in Australia, and Binnie & Partners in London.

In 1981, Hanke was appointed a senior economist with the president's [[Council of Economic Advisers]], where his responsibilities included the Reagan White House's water portfolio.<ref name="ssrn2">{{cite web|title=Crisis-Ridden Water Systems Should Go Private|last=Hanke|first=Steve|ssrn=2234053|year=1982}}</ref> While at the CEA, Hanke led a team that re-wrote the federal government's Principles and Guidelines for Water and Land Related Resources Implementation Studies, to include more rigorous benefit-cost analysis requirements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mumy|first1=Gene|last2=Hanke|first2=Steve|date=September 1975|title=Public Investment Criteria for Underpriced Public Products|jstor=1806550|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=65|issue=4|pages=712–720}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=On the Feasibility of Benefit-Cost Analysis|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=Spring 1981|ssrn=2245214}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=February 1982|title=On Turvey's Benefit-Cost "Short-Cut": A Study of Water Meters|jstor=3146083|journal=Land Economics|volume=58|issue=1|pages=144–146|doi=10.2307/3146083}}</ref>

===Privatization===
Hanke has produced eight books and numerous articles and proposals dealing with the privatization of public-sector resources. In 1972, he was a research associate at the [[National Museums of Kenya]], where he worked with anthropologist and conservationist [[Richard Leakey]] on the economics of big game cropping and hunting, as well as the privatization of big game reserves to combat poaching.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2017/09/08/only-private-property-will-save-africas-wildlife/#766933032385|title=Only Private Property Will Save Africa's Wildlife|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=September 8, 2017|work=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> Hanke also worked with Barney Dowdle of the [[University of Washington]] and the [[Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians]] of Lincoln County, Oregon, on a proposal to privatize portions of their reservation, as a means of improving economic opportunity on Native American reservations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/12/The-Revolution-in-Development-Economics-Siletz-Indians-Hanke-Dowdle-1.pdf|title=The Revolution in Development Economics|last1=Hanke|first1=Steve|last2=Walters|first2=Alan|date=1998|publisher=The Cato Institute}}</ref>

Hanke's work to privatize public lands put him at odds with Secretary of the Interior [[James Watt]] and members of the [[Sagebrush Rebellion]], who sought to transfer federal public lands to state control, rather than to private ownership.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/03/opinion/l-watt-s-liberal-sins-009527.html|title=Watt's Liberal Sins|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=July 3, 1983|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2017/12/17/follow-the-founders-and-privatize-public-lands/#7b861ee64db0|title=Follow The Founders And Privatize Public Lands|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=December 17, 2017|work=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> In 1982, Hanke left the CEA, joining a number of influential Reagan administration supply-siders, including [[Martin Anderson (economist)|Martin Anderson]], Norman B.

In 1984, Hanke was appointed a senior adviser to the [[Joint Economic Committee]] of the U.S. Congress, where he advised Senators [[Steve Symms]] and [[Paul Laxalt]] on [[privatization]].

Although the English term "reprivatisation" first appeared in ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine in the 1930s, and subsequently in various academic journals,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bel|first=Germa|date=Summer 2006|title=The Coining of "Privatization" and Germany's National Socialist Party|url=http://www.ub.edu/graap/JEP.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=20|issue=3|pages=187–194|doi=10.1257/jep.20.3.187|doi-access=free}}</ref> Hanke and his wife, Liliane, are often credited with popularizing the term "privatization" – derived from the French term "''privatise''" – in the American economic lexicon during the 1980s, as well as for bringing about its inclusion in [[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's ''Collegiate Dictionary'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2018/01/Privatize-Dictionary-Wash-Post.pdf|title=Policy Faltered|last=Russakoff|first=Dale|website=Institute for Applied Economics Global Health and the Study of Business Enterprise|publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Hanke has authored numerous articles on the subject of privatization, including the entry for "Privatization" in the 1987 edition of ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]''.<ref name="dictionaryofeconomics">{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001758|title=Privatization : The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=1987|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref>

===Currency boards and dollarization===
After Hong Kong reinstated its currency board in 1983, Hanke began to collaborate with his fellow Johns Hopkins professor, and [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s personal economic adviser, Sir [[Alan Walters]], on the subject of currency boards.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="amazon">{{Cite book |last=Hanke |first=Steve H. |editor-last=Walters |editor-first=A. A. |title=Capital Markets and Development: A Sequoia Seminar |isbn=9781558150911 |publisher=Sequoia Inst |date=November 1991}}</ref> A [[currency board]] is a monetary authority that issues a local currency that is fully backed by a foreign reserve currency, and which is freely convertible with the foreign reserve currency at a fixed exchange rate. Walters was a key advocate of the reestablishment of Hong Kong's currency board.

Hanke and Walters established a currency board research program at Johns Hopkins. One of Hanke's first post-doctoral fellows in that program was Kurt Schuler. Shortly after Schuler's arrival at Johns Hopkins, Hanke and Schuler discovered that [[John Maynard Keynes]] was an advocate of currency boards.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/21/opinion/l-saving-the-ruble-458821.html|title=Saving the Ruble|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=August 21, 1998|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Hanke and Schuler presented these findings, including original documentation, in a book edited by Walters and Hanke.<ref name="ssrn3">{{cite web|ssrn=2206447|title=Keynes's Russian Currency Board by Steve H. Hanke, Kurt Schuler :: SSRN|year=1991}}</ref>

During this time, Hanke also began conducting research on [[dollarization]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/dollarization-argentina|title=Dollarization for Argentina|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=February 17, 1999|website=Cato Institute}}</ref> whereby a country replaces its domestic currency with a stable foreign currency – creating a de facto fixed-exchange-rate monetary system between two countries.

Over the course of his career, Hanke has written over 20 books and monographs and over 300 articles on currency boards and dollarization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/04/Rodgers-et-al-bibliography-June-2013-Final.pdf|title=On Currency Boards – An Updated Bibliography of Scholarly Writings|last1=Gross|first1=Thomas|last2=Heft|first2=Joshua|date=April 2013|website=Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study for Business Enterprise|last3=Rodgers|first3=Douglas}}</ref> Many of these were written in collaboration with Kurt Schuler. Hanke also co-authored with Sir Alan Walters the entry for "Currency Boards"  in the 1992 edition of ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance''.<ref>{{Cite web|ssrn=2206424|title=Currency Boards: The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=1992|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref>

In addition, he played a central role in drafting and bringing about the inclusion of the so-called "Hanke Amendment" in the 1993 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill.<ref name=":0" /> This measure, sponsored by Senators [[Phil Graham]], [[Bob Dole]], [[Connie Mack]], [[Jesse Helms]], and [[Steve Symms]] allowed U.S. contributions to the International Monetary Fund to be used for the purpose of establishing currency boards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-106/pdf/STATUTE-106-Pg1633.pdf|title=Public Law 102-391|last=102nd Congress|date=October 6, 1992|publisher=Government Publishing Office}}</ref>

===Hyperinflation===
Hanke has also written extensively on the subject of [[hyperinflation]], which occurs when a country's inflation rate exceeds 50% per month. In 2008, Hanke and Alex Kwok published a paper,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hanke|first1=Steve|last2=Kwok|first2=Alex|date=Spring–Summer 2009|title=On the Measurement of Zimbabwe's Hyperinflation|url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2009/5/cj29n2-8.pdf|journal=The Cato Journal|volume=29|pages=353–364}}</ref> which estimated that Zimbabwe's hyperinflation peaked in November 2008 at {{val|7.96|e=10}}%. This makes Zimbabwe's hyperinflation the second-highest in history – peaking 3.5 months after the Mugabe government stopped reporting inflation statistics, and 1.5 months after the IMF's last estimate of Zimbabwe's inflation rate, with a peak inflation rate 30&nbsp;million times higher than the last official rate.<ref name=":7" />

Hanke employs a methodology, based on the principle of [[purchasing power parity]], which allows him to accurately estimate inflation in countries with very high inflation rates. Using this methodology, Hanke and his collaborators discovered several cases of hyperinflation that had previously gone unreported in the academic literature and popular press. These include the 1923 hyperinflation episode in the [[Free City of Danzig]], and more recently, suspected cases in North Korea (2011), and Iran (2012).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/workingpaper-8.pdf|title=World Hyperinflations|last1=Hanke|first1=Steve|last2=Krus|first2=Nicholas|date=August 15, 2012|publisher=The Cato Institute}}</ref> In 2012, Hanke and Nicholas Krus documented 56 cases of hyperinflation that have occurred in history, in "World Hyperinflations", a chapter in the ''Routledge Handbook of Major Events in Economic History''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Handbook-of-Major-Events-in-Economic-History/Parker-Whaples/p/book/9780415677035|title=Routledge Handbook of Major Events in Economic History|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415677035}}</ref> Since then, Hanke has documented two additional cases of hyperinflation: One occurred in Venezuela in 2016,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hanke|first1=Steve|last2=Bushnell|first2=Charles|date=July–September 2017|title=On Measuring Hyperinflation: Venezuela's Episode|url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/articles/hanke-world-economics-july-2017.pdf|journal=World Economics|volume=18}}</ref> and the other occurred in Zimbabwe in 2017.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/10/Zimbabwe%E2%80%99s-Hyperinflates-Again-Hanke-Bostrom-Cover-Page-Paper.pdf|title=Zimbabwe Hyperinflates, Again: The 58th Episode of Hyperinflation in History|last1=Hanke|first1=Steve|last2=Bostrom|first2=Erik|date=October 2017|website=Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise}}</ref>

In 2013, Hanke founded the Troubled Currencies Project, a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins University and the Cato Institute, in order to track exchange-rate and inflation data in countries including Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="cato2"/>

===Monetary analysis===
Hanke's views on monetary policy are influenced by his experience as a currency and commodities trader, as well as by the economics of [[Milton Friedman]], [[Robert Mundell]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Hanke is a proponent of [[Divisia monetary aggregates]], originated by [[William A. Barnett]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/04/William-Barnett-Interview.pdf|title=An Interview with William A.

In 2012, Hanke developed a method of monetary analysis known as state-money/bank-money analysis (SMBMA).<ref name="m3web2">{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=146010|title=Reflections on the World's Monetary Mess|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=December 13, 2012|website=Novinite.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/10/hanke_on_hyperi.html|title=Hanke on Hyperinflation, Monetary Policy, and Debt|last=Roberts|first=Russ|date=October 29, 2012|website=Library of Economics and Liberty}}</ref> This methodology is based on [[John Maynard Keynes]]' distinction between money produced by a central bank ("state money") and money produced via the private banking sector, through deposit creation ("bank money"), contained in the 1930 classic ''[[A Treatise on Money]]''.

Hanke has employed SMBMA as a method of analyzing the response of various countries to the 2008 financial crisis. In particular, Hanke has employed SMBMA for the United States, the United Kingdom, and various countries in the European Union to study the pro-cyclical effects of higher capital-asset ratios implemented during economic downturns. Hanke has been an outspoken critic of pro-cyclical capital requirements imposed under [[Basel III]], [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd–Frank]], and other financial regulatory regimes.<ref name=":1" /> Also, he is on the advisory board of the [[Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum]] (OMFIF) in London, where he regularly contributes to the OMFIF's ''The Bulletin'' and is involved in meetings regarding financial and monetary systems.

=== Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar ===
{{Main|Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar}}
Hanke and his colleague [[Richard Conn Henry|Dick Henry]], a professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Physics and Astronomy, developed the [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]], which aims to reform the current Gregorian calendar by making every year identical.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/story/2011-12-29/new-calendar-same-days-every-year/52276386/1|title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter|last=Weise|first=Elizabeth|date=December 29, 2011|work=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hankehenryontime.com/|title=Hanke Henry Permanent Calendar|website=hankehenryontime.com}}</ref> With the Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar, every calendar date would always fall on the same day of the week. Some of the advantages would include a permanent day of the week for all holidays; a simplification of financial calculations, and it would not draw criticism from religious groups because it retains the Sabbath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsci.com/economist-steve-hanke-kill-your-holidays|title=This man would like to kill your holidays|last=Hongoltz-Hetling|first=Matt|date=September 10, 2017|website=Popular Science}}</ref> The calendar also integrates the [[abolition of time zones]].

==Economic advising and currency reform==
Hanke began advising political leaders on economic issues in the late 1970s, when he served as a member of the Governor's Council of Economic Advisers for the State of Maryland, along with [[Carl Christ]] and Clopper Almon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/research-programs/state-of-maryland-public-policy/|title=State Of Maryland Public Policy|website=Institute for Applied Economic, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise}}</ref> After stints at the president's Council of Economic Advisers, the [[United States Congressional Joint Economic Committee|Congressional Joint Economic Committee]], and the president's Task Force on Project Economic Justice during the Reagan administration, Hanke began advising heads of state in developing countries on a ''[[pro-bono]]'' basis.

Hanke has advised five presidents (Bulgaria, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and Montenegro); five cabinet ministers (Albania, Argentina, Ecuador, Yugoslavia, and the United Arab Emirates); and has held two cabinet-level positions (Lithuania and Montenegro).<ref name=":0" />

As the fall of communism and the [[Soviet ruble]] began to spark currency crises throughout the former Soviet Union, Hanke began to work as an economic adviser to a number of heads of state in newly independent countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.<ref name=":0" />

In 1998, under Hanke's leadership, Friedberg Mercantile Group, Inc. was one of the few trading shops to predict the devaluation of the Russian ruble. Hanke predicted that the devaluation would occur after mid-year, and the ruble collapsed shortly thereafter, on August 17, 1998.<ref>Hanke, Steve H. "Russia's Rickety Ruble," Friedberg's Commodity and Currency Comments, January 11, 1998.</ref>

In collaboration with his then-post-doctoral student, Kurt Schuler, Hanke developed a blueprint for a currency board reform package,<ref name=":11" /><ref name="heritage">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/currency-boards-for-eastern-europe|publisher=heritage.org|title=Currency Boards for Eastern Europe|access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref> which he proposed in a number of countries throughout the 1990s, including Albania,<ref name="ssrn5" /> Argentina,<ref name="Depalma" /><ref name="google3" /> Bulgaria,<ref name="m3web" /><ref name="ssrn4" /> Bosnia and Herzegovina,<ref name="baltimoresun" /> Ecuador,<ref name="uazuay.edu.ec" /> Estonia,<ref name="Ummelas" /><ref name="amazon2" /> Indonesia,<ref name=":5" /> Jamaica,<ref name=":10" /> Kazakhstan,<ref name=":11" /> Lithuania,<ref name="Ummelas" /> Montenegro,<ref name="Montenegro drops Yugoslav dinar" /> Russia,<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":13" /><ref name=":14" /> Venezuela,<ref name=":15" /> and Yugoslavia.<ref name=":8" />

===Argentina===
In 1989, Hanke met Argentine President [[Carlos Menem]], who connected Hanke and his wife, Liliane, with the libertarian faction in the Argentine Congress led by [[Alvaro Alsogaray]], for the purpose of developing a currency reform that would end Argentina's inflation problems.<ref name="academia">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/5020087|publisher=academia.edu|title=Critical Policy Studies Transnational discourse coalitions and monetary policy: Argentina and the limited powers of the ''Washington Consensus'' &#124; Dieter Plehwe - Academia.edu |access-date=January 8, 2017|last1=Plehwe|first1=Dieter}}</ref> Hanke was an early proponent of a currency board system for Argentina, which he outlined in a 1991 book.<ref name="Depalma"/> The book, ''¿Banco Central O Caja de Conversión?'' was co-authored by Kurt Schuler and included a preface by Argentine Congressman José María Ibarbia, who was a member of the Alsogaray faction.<ref name="google3">{{cite book|title=Banco central o caja de conversión?|author1=Hanke, S.H.|author2=Schuler, K.|date=1991|publisher=Fundación República para una Nueva Generación|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ1GAAAAYAAJ|access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref>

Later, Hanke worked closely with Menem and members of the Argentine Congress to implement a currency board, along the general lines of Hanke and Schuler's original proposal.<ref name="ReferenceA">Effinger, Anthony. "Argentina Appoints U.S. Professor as Currency Advisor." Bloomberg[Buenos Aires] 18 Jan. 1995: n. pag.

During the 1989 to 1991 period, Hanke worked closely with Congressman José María Ibarbia and his colleagues (the so-called Alsogaray faction) in the Argentine Congress to develop a blueprint for a currency board system. That blueprint was published in Buenos Aires and contains a preface written by José María Ibarbia.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=June 29, 2018|title=Argentina Should Scrap the Peso and Dollarize|url=https://www.cato.org/commentary/argentina-should-scrap-peso-dollarize|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-19|website=CATO}}</ref>

Following Hanke and Sir [[Alan Walters]]' 1994 prediction of the Mexican peso's collapse,<ref>Hanke, Steve H., and Alan Walters. "The Wobbly Peso." Forbes 154.1 (1994): 161. Business Source Complete. Web. 6 Dec. 2013.</ref> Argentine Finance Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]] invited Hanke to serve as his adviser.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> During this time, Hanke's primary role was to leverage his scholarship and experience as one of the experts who was in the middle of the currency reform debates before the adoption of the convertibility system – as well as his credibility established when he predicted the [[tequila crisis]] – to explain how the convertibility system operated at the time, and to restore confidence in Argentina and the peso's international credibility.<ref>Hanke, Steve H. "Pegged Out." Forbes 155.2 (1995): 119. Business Source Complete. Web. 6 Dec. 2013.</ref> At the time, Hanke was described by Argentine newspapers as "Cavallo's spokesman"<ref>Martinez, Oscar. "El Vocero De Cavallo." Noticias [Buenos Aires] 8 Oct. 1995: 52–53. Print.</ref> and the "generator of confidence" in the Argentine economy.<ref>"Profesión: Generador De Confianza." Editorial. El Economista 3 Nov. 1995: 21. Print.</ref>

Argentina's convertibility system differed in several key respects from Hanke's original proposal, however. In October 1991, the year the system was implemented, Hanke warned in a ''Wall Street Journal'' op-ed that the convertibility system could begin to function as a central bank, and eventually collapse.<ref>Steve H. Hanke. "Argentina Should Abolish Its Central Bank," Wall Street Journal, October 25, 1991 https://ssrn.com/abstract=2262476</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|ssrn=2262476|title=Argentina Should Abolish Its Central Bank|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=October 1991}}</ref> This prediction came true in the late 1990s, as the Argentine convertibility system began to function like a [[central bank]] and engage in [[sterilization (economics)|sterilization]]. Hanke wrote many articles showing that the convertibility system was not a currency board.<ref name=":9" />

As the convertibility system began to falter, [[Carlos Menem]], on Hanke's advice, proposed dollarization for Argentina – first in 1995 and again in January 1999.<ref name="cato4">{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/foreign-policy-briefing/dollarization-blueprint-argentina|title=A Dollarization Blueprint for Argentina|last1=Hanke|first1=Steve|last2=Schuler|first2=Kurt|date=March 12, 1999|series=Foreign Policy Briefing No. 52|publisher=The Cato Institute|access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref> In February 1999, Menem asked Hanke to prepare a dollarization blueprint for Argentina. This proposal was never acted upon, and the convertibility system ultimately collapsed in 2002.<ref name=":9" />

===Yugoslavia and Albania===
In January 1990, Hanke was appointed the personal economic adviser to Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zivko Pregl.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="baltimoresun2">{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-08-16/business/1991228120_1_yugoslavia-pregl-accounting-and-business|title=Professor helps Yugoslavia adjust JHU educator promotes Yugoslavian capitalism.|last=Hetrick|first=Ross|date=August 16, 1991|website=The Baltimore Sun}}</ref> Although Pregl was at one point a leader of the Communist League of Yugoslavia, he sought Hanke's counsel on ways to liberalize [[Yugoslavia]]'s socialist economy. During this time, Hanke proposed a number of free-market reforms, including the [[privatization]] of Yugoslavia's pension system, as well as a [[currency board]] system to address the failing Yugoslav dinar.<ref name="ssrn6">{{cite web|title=Reflections on Yugoslavia's Transition to a Market Economy|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=1990-11-13|ssrn=2206589}}</ref>

In 1991, the Ekonomski Institute Beograd published a book, in the Serbo-Croatian language, which Hanke and Schuler co-authored.<ref name=":8" /> The book laid out the details about what would have been a Yugoslav currency board. However, these efforts were suspended when the Yugoslav civil war broke out and Pregl resigned in June 1991. After the war broke out, Hanke continued his involvement in the Balkans, working with [[Deloitte|Deloitte & Touche]]'s Eastern European division to establish new Deloitte offices and bring traditional financial accounting to the formerly communist country.<ref name="baltimoresun2"/>

In 1991, Hanke began advising Albanian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Gramoz Pashko on the possibility of establishing a currency board in [[Albania]]. The proposal was contained in Hanke and Kurt Schuler's 1991 monograph "A Currency Board Solution for the Albanian Lek", published by the [[International Freedom Foundation]].<ref name="ssrn5"/> The proposal was never acted upon.

===Bulgaria===
In 1990, Hanke anticipated [[Bulgaria]]'s 1991 [[hyperinflation]] episode and began designing a currency board system for Bulgaria. He incorporated this proposal into a monograph co-authored with Kurt Schuler. The monograph, "Teeth for the Bulgarian Lev: A Currency Board Solution" was published in 1991.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="ssrn4"/>

Hanke continued his work on a Bulgarian [[currency board]], periodically visiting Sofia throughout the early 1990s.<ref name=":17">{{Cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/04/Working_Paper_Hanke_Bulgaria_Fifteen_Years_Later.pdf|title=Bulgaria: Fifteen Years Later|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=2012|website=Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise}}</ref> In late 1996, Hanke and Schuler's currency reform handbook ''Currency Boards for Developing Countries'' gained popularity when a pirated Bulgarian-language version of the book became a best-seller in Sofia.<ref>Robinson, Anthony. "Idea Whose Time Has Come." Financial Times [London] 26 Mar. 1997: n. pag. Print.</ref>

In 1997, during Bulgaria's second episode of hyperinflation, Hanke was appointed as an adviser to Bulgarian President [[Petar Stoyanov]], and worked to bring about the establishment of Bulgaria's currency board.<ref name="m3web3">{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=146017|title=Hanke: Bulgaria Performs a Bit Better than Average|website=Novinite|publisher=Sofia News Agency}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443847404577631063612690428|title=Bulgaria's Lesson for Euro-Skeptics|date=September 9, 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Inspired by the original Hanke-Schuler blueprint, members of the Bulgarian government drafted a law which converted the [[Bulgarian National Bank]] to a currency board system. Acting in his capacity as Stoyanov's adviser, Hanke continued to be deeply involved in fine-tuning and steering his idea to full adoption, throughout the drafting, legislative, and implementation process.<ref name="m3web4">{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/10460/FIFTH+ANNIVERSARY+OF+ADOPTING+CURRENCY+BOARD+SYSTEM+MARKED|title=Fifth Anniversary of Adopting Currency Board System Marked|website=Novinite|publisher=Sofia News Agency}}</ref>

Bulgaria adopted the proposal and installed the currency board on July 1, 1997. The currency board linked the [[Bulgarian lev|lev]] to the German [[Deutsche Mark]], and later the [[euro]]. Upon adoption, the Bulgarian Currency Board immediately put an end to the country's 1997 hyperinflation episode.<ref name=":17" /> Hanke continued to serve as President Stoyanov's adviser until the end of his term in 2002.

Hanke remains active in Bulgaria, as a vocal supporter of the currency board, the country's [[flat tax]], and anti-corruption measures.

===Estonia===
In 1992, Hanke, Kurt Schuler, and Lars Jonung – then a professor at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] – released a book in both English and Estonian containing a blueprint for an Estonian [[currency board]].<ref name="amazon2">{{cite book|title=Monetary reform for a free Estonia: A currency board solution|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=1992|publisher=SNS Forlag; 1st edition|isbn = 978-9171504432}}</ref>

After Jonung was appointed chief economic advisor to Swedish Prime Minister [[Carl Bildt]], in 1992, Jonung convinced Bildt to embrace the idea of a currency board for [[Estonia]] and arrange for its presentation to the Estonian government. In May 1992, Hanke presented the currency board blueprint to members of Estonia's Constituent Assembly in Tallinn.<ref name=":0" />

One month later, in June 1992, Estonia adopted a monetary system based on the Hanke-Jonung-Schuler proposal. Estonia thus abandoned the [[Soviet ruble]] and began issuing its own currency, linking the [[Estonian kroon]] to the German Mark at a fixed exchange rate.<ref name="Ummelas"/> Following the introduction of the euro, the kroon was linked to the euro, until January 1, 2011, when Estonia officially adopted the euro as its currency.

===Lithuania===
In the early 1990s, [[George Selgin]], Joseph Sinkey Jr., and Kurt Schuler began working with Elena Leontjeva of the [[Lithuanian Free Market Institute]] (LFMI) on a reform proposal for [[Lithuania]]'s central bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.llri.lt/news/economic-policy/finance-and-monetary-policy/a-reminiscence-on-the-origins-of-the-law-on-litas-credibility/lrinka|title=A Reminiscence on the Origins of the Law on Litas Credibility|last=Schuler|first=Kurt|date=April 1, 2004|website=Lithuanian Free Market Institute}}</ref> Later, Hanke also began collaborating with the LFMI during regular visits to Vilnius.

Having witnessed the positive effects of neighboring Estonia's [[currency board]], Lithuanian Prime Minister [[Adolfas Šleževičius]],<ref name=":4" /> met with Hanke and his wife Liliane over lunch in January 1994 to discuss the possibility of a currency reform package for Lithuania. During that meeting, Šleževičius appointed Hanke a state counselor – a cabinet-level appointment – and tasked him with designing a currency board system for Lithuania.<ref name=":0" />

The LFMI immediately arranged for Hanke and Schuler to publish a book in Lithuanian, ''Valiutu Taryba: Pasiulymai Lietuvai''. Their book contained a currency board blueprint for the country. This measure was adopted in April 1994, linking the [[Lithuanian litas]] to the German Mark at a fixed exchange rate. Following the introduction of the euro, the litas was linked to the euro, until January 1, 2015, when Lithuania officially adopted the euro as its currency.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Influenced by the 1991 Hanke-Schuler book proposing a currency board for Yugoslavia,<ref>Cosic, Sabine. "U.S. Money Guru Urges Currency Board for Bosnia." Reuters Financial Service [Sarajevo] 16 Dec. 1996: n. pag. Print.</ref> the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] required Bosnia and Herzegovina to employ a currency board for at least six years.<ref name="senate">{{cite web|url=http://www.banking.senate.gov/00_04hrg/042700/hanke.htm|title=Oversight Hearing on International Monetary Fund Reform|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=April 27, 2000|website=Senate Banking Committee: Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance}}</ref> In the aftermath of the Yugoslav civil war, local officials and an IMF team set about to create a central bank for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] based on the principles of a currency board.

Hanke began serving as a special adviser to the U.S. government in December 1996<ref name=":0" /> and was tasked with ensuring that the [[central bank]] law resulted in a [[currency board]] system that was as orthodox as possible.<ref name="baltimoresun"/>

Shortly after his appointment, Hanke published a critique of the [[IMF]] currency board proposal.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=January 21, 2013|title=A Field Report from Sarajevo and Pale|journal=Central Banking Journal|volume=7|ssrn=2204625}}</ref> [[Warren Coats]], a key member of the IMF team discussed Hanke's involvement at length in a 2007 book.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/06/One_Currency_for_Bosnia_Coats.pdf|title=One Currency for Bosnia: Creating the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina|last=Coats|first=Warren|publisher=Jameson Books, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0915463992}}</ref> In a section of the book titled "Steve Hanke" Coats recounts:

===Indonesia===
In August 1997, upon urging from the [[International Monetary Fund]], Indonesia adopted a floating exchange rate for its currency, the [[rupiah]]. In the ensuing months, the rupiah weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar. Inflation in [[Indonesia]] began to accelerate, sparking food riots across the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/10/business/international-business-indonesia-considers-radical-shift-for-currency-hitching.html?src=pm|title=International Business; Indonesia Considers a Radical Shift For Currency, Hitching It to Dollar|last=Kahn|first=Joseph|date=February 10, 1998|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

In February 1998, Indonesian President [[Suharto]] invited Hanke to serve as his economic adviser.<ref name="Mydans">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/world/american-with-cure-all-enlivens-jakarta-crisis.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fF%2fFinances | work=The New York Times | first=Seth | last=Mydans | title=American With Cure-All Enlivens Jakarta Crisis | date=February 28, 1998}}</ref> On the day of Hanke's appointment as special counselor and a member of Indonesia's Economic and Monetary Resilience Council, the rupiah appreciated by 28% against the U.S. dollar.<ref name="jhu6">{{cite web|url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/aprjun98/jun0898/08hanke.html|title=Steve H.

Hanke recommended that Indonesia institute an orthodox currency board, linking the rupiah to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate. Hanke supported the reforms contained in the IMF's package. But, he argued that the IMF's program would fail unless it was coupled with a currency board arrangement.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-hanke.t.html | work=The New York Times | first=Stephens | last=Broening | title=Q & A / Steve Hanke : Voice of Suharto's Guru | date=March 20, 1998}}</ref>

Hanke referred to his alternative reform package for Indonesia as "IMF Plus". It garnered the support of notable economists, including [[Gary Becker]], [[Rudiger Dornbusch]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Merton Miller]], [[Robert Mundell]], and Sir [[Alan Walters]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=2002|title=On Dollarization and Currency Boards: Error and Deception|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Hanke01.pdf|journal=Policy Reform|volume=5|issue=4|pages=203–222|doi=10.1080/1384128032000096814|citeseerx=10.1.1.372.698|s2cid=153760315}}</ref>  Hanke was also named one of the twenty-five most influential people in the world by ''World Trade Magazine'' during this time.<ref name="jhu2" />

In 1998, during his State of the Nation address, Suharto announced his intention to adopt Hanke's currency board proposal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/115037|title=Back from the brink: Mexico's financial crisis was different from Asia's, but it holds valuable lessons|date=March 5, 1998|work=The Economist}}</ref> This plan was met with opposition by the governments of Germany, Japan, and Singapore, among others. Economists including [[Nouriel Roubini]] and [[Paul Krugman]] also entered the fray with criticism of Hanke's proposal.<ref name="Mydans"/> The fiercest resistance, however, came from the IMF and from U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] – who threatened to withdraw $43&nbsp;billion in aid if Indonesia adopted Hanke's proposal.<ref>Blustein, P (1998). "Currency dispute threatens Indonesia's bailout: Clinton backs IMF in pressing Suharto not to change country's monetary system," ''Washington Post,'' 14 February.
</ref>

Later, officials including former U.S. Secretary of State [[Lawrence Eagleburger]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pages.jh.edu/~iaesbe/hankepub_files/wsj-indonesia060205.pdf|title=IMF Program Shoved Suharto Out the Door|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=June 2, 2005|work=The Wall Street Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110175516/http://pages.jh.edu/~iaesbe/hankepub_files/wsj-indonesia060205.pdf|archive-date=2018-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> and former Australian Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]]<ref>Agence France Presse (1999) Former Aussie PM says US used Asia crisis to oust Suharto, 11 November.</ref> conceded that criticism of Hanke's proposal did not stem from opposition to the economics of Hanke's proposal, but rather out of concern that a stable rupiah would thwart U.S.-led efforts to oust Suharto. As Nobel laureate [[Merton Miller]] recalled in 1999, the objection to Hanke's proposal was "not that it wouldn't work but that it would, and if it worked, they would be stuck with Suharto."<ref>Tyson, J. L. (1999) 'Dollar Diplomacy' rises again as foreign-policy tool. Christian Science Monitor, 10
February.
</ref>

Under intense international pressure, Suharto ultimately reversed course and abandoned Hanke's "IMF Plus" proposal. On May 21, 1998, amid continued currency problems, as well as protests and reports of a brewing military coup, Suharto resigned as president of Indonesia.<ref name=":0" />

===Montenegro===
In 1999, Hanke and Montenegrin economist Željko Bogetić, who was an economist at the [[IMF]] at the time, wrote ''Crnogorska marka'', a book published in [[Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006)|Montenegro]], proposing an orthodox [[currency board]] for Montenegro, which was part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Montenegro would issue a Montenegrin "marka" to replace the Yugoslav dinar.<ref>Zeljko Bogetic and Steve H. Hanke. ''Cronogorska Marka''. Podgorica, Montenegro: Antena M, 1999 (Serbo-Croatian).</ref> Later that year in July 1999, Hanke was appointed state counselor – a cabinet-level position – and began advising Montenegrin President [[Milo Đukanović]] on issues including currency reform.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/010206wodtuesday.html|title=Economic View: Steve H. Hanke Would Rather Take Criticism Then Obscurity|last=DePalma|first=Anthony|date=February 4, 2001|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="jhu8">{{cite web|url=http://www.jhu.edu/news_info/news/home99/jul99/hanke.html|title=Hopkins Professor Named Advisor to Montenegro's President|date=July 15, 1999|website=Johns Hopkins University News Releases|publisher=Headlines@Hopkins}}</ref> After assessing the political and economic realities on the ground, Hanke advised Đukanović that Montenegro should abandon the faltering Yugoslav dinar and adopt a foreign currency, the German Mark, as its own.<ref name=":0" /> This process is known as [[dollarization]].

In 1999, [[Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006)|Montenegro]] was part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], along with [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Serbia]]. Đukanović began pursuing Hanke's dollarization proposal for both economic and political reasons. In addition to providing relief from high inflation, [[dollarization]] also promised [[Montenegro]] the ability to pursue economic – and ultimately political – independence from Serbia.<ref name="Montenegro drops Yugoslav dinar" />

In late 1999, Montenegro introduced the German Mark as an official currency. In late 2000, the Yugoslav dinar was officially dropped, making the Deutsche Mark the sole legal tender in Montenegro.<ref name="Montenegro drops Yugoslav dinar"/>

===Ecuador===
Hanke was also an early proponent of currency boards, and later, dollarization in [[Ecuador]].<ref name="uazuay.edu.ec"/> In 1995, Hanke and Kurt Schuler published a [[currency board]] blueprint in Spanish that was widely circulated in Ecuador.<ref name=":15" /> In May 1996, Hanke traveled to Ecuador to encourage then-presidential candidate [[Abdalá Bucaram]] to pursue a currency board for Ecuador. Shortly thereafter, Bucaram raised the idea of a currency board while on the campaign trail.

Following Bucaram's election, Hanke presented a [[dollarization]] proposal to members of the Ecuadorian government.<ref name=":0" /> But, by February 1997, Bucaram had been removed from office on insanity charges, and the dollarization idea lay dormant.

However, in 1999, Ecuador's currency, the sucre, collapsed, losing 75% of its value against the U.S. dollar from the start of 1999 until the first week of January 2000.<ref name="uazuay.edu.ec"/> Shortly thereafter, Ecuadorian President [[Jamil Mahuad]] resurrected the dollarization idea. On January 9, 2000, he announced that Ecuador would abandon the sucre and officially adopt the U.S. dollar, putting an end to Ecuador's high inflation.<ref name="cato5">{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/blog/dollarization-keeps-ecuador-economically-stable-despite-political-instability|title=Dollarization Keeps Ecuador Economically Stable Despite Political Instability|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=October 1, 2010|website=Cato @ Liberty|publisher=The Cato Institute}}</ref>

In 2001, Hanke was appointed adviser to Ecuador's Minister of Finance and Economy, to assist with the implementation of dollarization. In 2003, Hanke was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Arts by the [[Universidad San Francisco de Quito]], and in 2004, he was named professor asociado by the [[Universidad del Azuay]] in Cuenca, Ecuador, in honor of his reform efforts in Ecuador and scholarship on dollarization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/04/Tristana-Santos_The-Dollarizers.pdf|title=The Dollarizers|last=Santos|first=Tristana|date=2015|website=Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise}}</ref>

==Currency and commodity trading==
Hanke has been trading commodities and currencies for over 60 years. He has also trained a number of Johns Hopkins students who have gone on to successful careers in finance. He is chairman emeritus of the Friedberg Mercantile Group, Inc. in Toronto. During the 1990s, he served as president of Toronto Trust Argentina (TTA) in Buenos Aires. It was the world best performing mutual fund in 1995.<ref name="merar">{{cite web|url=http://www.merar.com/weblog/2012/05/30/thoughts-about-the-1995-best-emerging-market-fund/|title=Toronto Trust Argentina Investment Fund: Thoughts about the 1995's Best Emerging Market Fund|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=May 30, 2012|publisher=Merar|access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref>

Hanke also serves on the supervisory board of AMG (Advanced Metallurgical Group, N.V.), which was the best performing stock on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 2017, with its market capitalization increasing by 201%. In May 2019, Hanke was appointed chairman of AMG's supervisory board.<ref name="amg-nv">{{cite web|url=http://www.amg-nv.com/About-Us/Supervisory-Board/default.aspx|title=About Us - Supervisory Board|website=AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group, N.V.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amg-nv.com/release/?id=2161251&date=201801|title=AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V.

In 1995, during the Mexican [[tequila crisis]], many investors were shying away from Argentine investments. Relying on his deep understanding of the convertibility system, Hanke bet against the market and had TTA fully invested in Argentine peso-denominated bonds.<ref>Hanke, Steve H. "Arbitrage in Argentina," ''Forbes'', December 19, 1994.</ref> As a result, TTA was the world's best performing mutual fund in 1995, with a 79.25% increase.

Hanke has taken several other notable successful trading positions during his career. For example, in late 1985, he was among the first to correctly predict that oil would fall below $10 per barrel,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/04/business/oil-prices-plunge-again-on-worry-over-output.html | work=The New York Times | first=Lee A. | last=Daniels | title=Oil Prices Plunge Again On Worry Over Output | date=February 4, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/25/business/oil-prices-plunge-after-opec-adjourns.html|title=Oil Prices Plunge After Opec Adjourns|last=Daniels|first=Lee A.|date=March 25, 1986|work=The New York Times}}</ref> and in 1993, he joined a successful speculative attack on the French franc, which illicited an article in ''[[Paris Match]]'', "''Scenario-fiction Pour Une Journée De Cocagne: Hunt, Hanke, Goldsmith Tsutsumi Et Les Autres...''".<ref name=":0" /><ref name="baltimoresun3">{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-08-10/news/1993222036_1_french-franc-speculators-strong-franc|title=Speculators Saved France from the Curse of the Strong Franc|last=Hanke|first=Steve|date=August 10, 1993|website=The Baltimore Sun}}</ref>

Hanke has also worked as an expert witness in financial litigation, specializing in [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] cases. In the past, he was a principal at Chicago Partners (now [[Navigant Consulting]]). In 1994, Hanke, his then-post-doctoral student Christopher Culp,<ref name="chicagobooth">{{cite web|url=http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/about/fellows/|title=Institute Fellows|website=Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study for Business Enterprise}}</ref> and Nobel laureate [[Merton Miller]] waded into the debate over the collapse of [[Metallgesellschaft]] AG. Although not officially involved in the case, Hanke, Culp, and Miller made headlines when they revealed that Metallgesellschaft's oil futures hedge was sound, and that it was Deutsche Bank who was responsible for the collapse of the $1.3&nbsp;billion position.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/business/the-oil-futures-bloodbath-is-the-bank-the-culprit.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Oil-Futures Bloodbath: Is the Bank the Culprit?|last=Nasar|first=Sylvia|date=October 16, 1994|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Former Bulgarian bureaucrat [[Krasimir Angarski]] who was tasked with the introduction of the currency board has contested the often repeated claim that Hanke is the "father of the Bulgarian currency board"<ref name=":2" /><ref name="m3web7">{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=144715|title=Father of Bulgaria's Currency Peg Prescribes 'Unique' Corruption Cure|date=November 2, 2012|website=Novinite|publisher=Sofia News Agency}}</ref> and has added that Hanke had no knowledge of the Currency Board law because Angarski refused to provide him the manuscript he was working on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bulnao.government.bg/files/_bg/Banker_160612.doc|title=За бащите, лелите и други роднини на Валутния борд|website=Bulgarian National Government}}</ref>

Angarski's claim is contradicted by the fact that Hanke first proposed a currency board for Bulgaria in 1991, with his book "Teeth for the Bulgarian Lev: A Currency Board Solution."<ref name="ssrn4" /> Hanke later helped bring about its adoption in 1997, when he served as an adviser to President [[Petar Stoyanov]].<ref name="m3web8">{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/146499/Steve+Hanke%3A+Fiscal+Discipline+Prize+Should+Go+to+Bulgaria|title=Steve Hanke: Fiscal Discipline Prize Should Go to Bulgaria|date=January 2, 2013|website=Novinite|publisher=Sofia News Agency}}</ref>

In December 2013, the Bulgarian newspaper ''[[Trud (Bulgarian newspaper)|Trud]]'' published an [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] refuting Angarski's claims and revealing that the Bulgarian National Audit Office had used official resources to propagate Angarski's claims.<ref name="trud">{{cite web|url=http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=2606288|title=Кой в София дезинформира от компютър 84.22.6.252?|website=Trud|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233546/http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=2606288|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead|access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref> The head of the Bulgarian National Audit Office, Valeri Dimitrov, was subsequently dismissed.<ref name="m3web9">{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/158179/Chair+of+Bulgaria%27s+National+Audit+Office+to+be+Replaced|title=Chair of Bulgaria's National Audit Office to be Replaced|date=February 13, 2014|website=Novinite|publisher=Sofia News Agency}}</ref>

In the article "Rupiah Rasputin" written in 1998 for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', [[Paul Krugman]] presented Hanke as "a self-promoter whose image as a successful country doctor has been pumped up by resume inflation," and accused him of fraudulently claiming that he is an adviser to former Argentine Finance Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]. Krugman additionally claimed that creating a currency board in Indonesia "was probably a bad idea right now", because it would interfere with payments for imports or debt service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/04/13/240868/index.htm|title=Rupiah Rasputin A currency board won't solve Indonesia's woes.|last=Krugman|first=Paul|date=April 13, 1998|website=Fortune Magazine}}</ref>
In January of 1995, seeming to support Hanke’s claim, Bloomberg News had reported, "The Argentine government named Johns Hopkins University professor Steve Hanke an advisor in an effort to assuage investors' concern that it will follow Mexico's lead and devalue the peso. Hanke authored Argentina's existing currency regime, under which the peso is fully backed by U.S. dollar reserves. The scheme took effect in April 1991 as the centerpiece of the government's anti-inflation program."<Ref>{{cite news |title= (BN) Argentina Appoints U.S. Professor as Currency Advisor |last= Effinger |first= Anthony  |date=19 Jan 1995 |publisher=Bloomberg }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cavallo's Musings on the Peso Rate Make Argentina's Market Skittish |first=Pamela |last=Druckerman |work=The Wall Street Journal |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB987115091722775217 |date=13 April 2001 |access-date= 8 July 2021 }}</ref>
