'''Arnold Zellner''' (January 2, 1927 – August 11, 2010) was an American [[economist]] and [[statistician]] specializing in the fields of [[Bayesian probability]] and [[econometrics]]. Zellner contributed pioneering work in the field of [[Bayesian analysis]] and [[econometric model]]ing.

In Bayesian analysis, Zellner not only provided many applications of it but also a new [[information theory|information-theoretic]] derivation of rules that are 100% efficient information processing rules — this class includes Bayes's theorem. In [[econometric modeling]], he, in association with [[Franz Palm]], developed the structural time-series approach for constructing new models and for checking the adequacy of old models. In addition, he was involved in many important applied econometric and statistical studies.

Born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to [[Ukrainian American|Ukrainian immigrant]] parents,<ref>{{cite web |last=Aybar |first= Pinar |url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/blogs/news/2010/08/in_memoriam_of_arnold_zellner.php |title=In Memoriam of Dr. Arnold Zellner |date=August 12, 2010 |publisher=College of Natural Resources, University of California, Berkeley }}</ref> Zellner earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in [[physics]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1949 and his [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], under supervision of [[George Kuznets]], in 1957. He held honorary degrees from the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] in Spain, the [[Universidade Técnica de Lisboa]] in [[Portugal]], the [[University of Kiel]] in [[Germany]], and the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam|Erasmus School of Economics]] at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].

He was H.G.B. Alexander Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Economics and Statistics at the Graduate School of Business of the [[University of Chicago]]. He was the founder of the [[International Society for Bayesian Analysis]] and also served as [[List of presidents of the American Statistical Association|President]] of the [[American Statistical Association]] in 1991.

He died on August 11, 2010, in his home in [[Hyde Park, Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/story/arnold-zellner-1927-2010-pioneer-modern-econometrics|title=Arnold Zellner, 1927–2010, a pioneer of modern econometrics |publisher=University of Chicago |date=August 13, 2010}}</ref>
