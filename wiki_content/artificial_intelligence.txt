<!-- DEFINITIONS -->
'''Artificial intelligence''' ('''AI''') is [[intelligence]] demonstrated by [[machine]]s, as opposed to '''natural intelligence'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> displayed by [[animal cognition|animals]] including [[human intelligence|humans]].
Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "[[intelligent agent]]s": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.{{efn|name="Definition of AI"
|Definition of AI as the study of [[intelligent agents]], drawn from the leading AI textbooks.
* {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=[http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf p. 1]}}, which provides the version that is used in this article. These authors use the term "computational intelligence" as a synonym for artificial intelligence.
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=55}} (who prefer the term "rational agent") and write "The whole-agent view is now widely accepted in the field".
* {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998}}
* {{Harvtxt|Legg|Hutter|2007}}
}}
Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the [[human mind]], such as "learning" and "problem solving", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.{{efn|[[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] characterize this definition as "thinking humanly" and reject it in favor of "acting rationally".{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=2}}}}

<!-- SUMMARIZING APPLICATIONS -->
AI applications include advanced [[web search]] engines (e.g. [[Google]]), [[recommendation systems]] (used by [[YouTube]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and [[Netflix]]), [[natural-language understanding|understanding human speech]] (such as [[Siri]] and [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]]), [[self-driving car]]s (e.g. [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]]), [[automated decision-making]] and competing at the highest level in [[strategic game]] systems (such as [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]]).{{sfnp|Google|2016}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the [[AI effect]].{{sfnp|McCorduck|2004|p=204}}  For instance, [[optical character recognition]] is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,{{sfnp|Ashok83|2019}} having become a routine technology.{{sfnp|Schank|1991|page=38}}

<!-- SUMMARIZING HISTORY AND APPROACHES  -->
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,{{sfnp|Crevier|1993|p=109}}<ref name="AI in the 80s" /> followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "[[AI winter]]"),<ref name="First AI winter" /><ref name="Second AI winter" /> followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.<ref name="AI in the 80s" />{{sfnp|Clark|2015b}} AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, [[Symbolic AI#Cognitive simulation|modeling human problem solving]], [[Symbolic AI#Logic-based|formal logic]], [[Symbolic AI#Knowledge-based|large databases of knowledge]] and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical [[machine learning]] has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.<ref name="AI widely used 1990s" />{{sfnp|Clark|2015b}}

<!-- SUMMARIZING GOALS AND TOOLS: SCOPE OF AI  -->
The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include [[automated reasoning|reasoning]], [[knowledge representation]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], [[machine learning|learning]], [[natural language processing]], [[machine perception|perception]], and the ability to move and manipulate objects.{{efn|name="Problems of AI"}} [[Artificial general intelligence|General intelligence]] (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.<ref name="Artificial General Intelligence" /> To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques -- including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on [[statistics]], [[probability]] and [[economics]]. AI also draws upon [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], and many other fields.

<!-- SUMMARISING PHILOSOPHY AND FUTUROLOGY -->
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".{{efn|This statement comes from the proposal for the [[Dartmouth workshop]] of 1956, which reads: "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."{{sfnp|McCarthy|Minsky|Rochester|Shannon|1955}}}}
This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by [[History of AI#AI in myth, fiction and speculation|myth]], [[artificial intelligence in fiction|fiction]], and [[philosophy of AI|philosophy]] since [[ancient history|antiquity]].{{sfnp|Newquist|1994|pp=45–53}}
[[Science fiction]] and [[futurology]] have also suggested that, with its enormous potential and power, AI may become an [[existential risk]] to humanity.{{sfnp|Spadafora|2016}}{{sfnp|Lombardo|Boehm|Nairz|2020}}

<!-- MAJOR INTELLECTUAL PRECURSORS: LOGIC, THEORY OF COMPUTATION -->
The study of mechanical or [[formal reasoning|"formal" reasoning]] began with [[philosopher]]s and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to [[Alan Turing]]'s [[theory of computation]], which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]].{{sfnp|Berlinski|2000}}

<!-- 1940s and Early 50s -->
The Church-Turing thesis, along with concurrent discoveries in [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]], [[information theory]] and [[cybernetics]], led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.<ref>

The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was [[Warren McCullouch|McCullouch]] and [[Walter Pitts|Pitts]]' 1943 formal design for [[Turing-complete]] "artificial neurons".{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=16}}

<!-- SYMBOLIC AI APPROACH: 1955-1990 -->
When access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to step-by-step symbol manipulation, known as [[Symbolic AI]] or [[GOFAI]]. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.

<!-- 1956 - 1974 -->
The field of AI research was born at [[Dartmouth workshop|a workshop]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1956.{{efn|

<!-- 1960s -->
Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.{{sfnp|Newquist|1994|pp=86–86}}
[[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do".<ref>

They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the [[Lighthill report|criticism]] of [[Sir James Lighthill]]{{sfnp|Lighthill|1973}}
and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to [[Mansfield Amendment|fund more productive projects]], both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an "[[AI winter]]", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.

<!-- SUBSYMBOLIC APPROACHES, 1980s -->
Many researchers began to doubt that the [[Symbolic AI|symbolic approach]] would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], robotics, [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems.{{sfnp|Nilsson|1998|p=7}} [[Robotics]] researchers, such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move, survive, and learn their environment.{{efn|

<!-- AGI, 2005-present -->
Numerous academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Much of current research involves statistical AI, which is overwhelmingly used to solve specific problems, even highly successful techniques such as [[deep learning]]. This concern has led to the subfield [[artificial general intelligence]] (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.<ref name="Artificial General Intelligence">

== Goals ==
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.{{efn|name="Problems of AI"|This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998}} and {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998}}}}

[[Unsupervised learning]] finds patterns in a stream of input. [[Supervised learning]] requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]]. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in -- the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as "function approximators" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, "spam" or "not spam".<ref>

are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[Search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use "[[heuristics]]" or "rules of thumb" that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called "[[Pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]").

[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[Particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]
A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name="Optimization search">[[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] searches:

[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[Artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses).

=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===
{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}
The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers ("if shiny then diamond") and controllers ("if diamond then pick up"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class is a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref>

[[Artificial neural network|Neural network]]s are also used for classification.<ref name="Neural networks"/>

Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as "naive Bayes" on most practical data sets.<ref>

were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple "neuron" ''N'' accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or "fired"), casts a weighted "vote" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed "[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes.

Modern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or and [[Pattern recognition|find patterns]] in data. They can learn continuous functions and even digital logical operations. Neural networks can be viewed a type of [[mathematical optimization]] &mdash; they perform a [[gradient descent]] on a multi-dimensional topology that was created by [[Machine learning|training]] the network. The most common training technique is the [[backpropagation]] algorithm.<ref name="Backpropagation">

uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in [[image processing]], lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.{{sfnp|Deng|Yu|2014|pp=199–200}} Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[image classification]]{{sfnp|Ciresan|Meier|Schmidhuber|2012}} and others.

Deep learning often uses [[convolutional neural network]]s for many or all of its layers. In a convolutional layer, each neuron receives input from only a restricted area of the previous layer called the neuron's [[receptive field]]. This can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons,{{sfnp|Habibi|2017}} and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex.{{sfnp|Fukushima|2007}}

=== Defining artificial intelligence ===

==== Thinking vs. acting: the Turing test ====
{{Main|Turing test|Dartmouth Workshop|Synthetic intelligence}}
[[Alan Turing]] wrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"{{sfnp|Turing|1950|p=1}}
He advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".{{sfnp|Turing|1948}} 
The only thing visible is the behavior of the machine, so it does not matter if the machine is [[consciousness|conscious]], or has a [[mind]], or whether the intelligence is merely a "simulation" and not "the real thing".  He noted that we also don't know these things about other people, but that we extend a "polite convention" that they are actually "thinking". This idea forms the basis of the [[Turing test]].<ref name="Turing test">

==== Acting humanly vs. acting intelligently: intelligent agents ====
{{Main|Intelligent agents}}

AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] said: "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence".{{sfnp|Maker|2006}} [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] agree and criticize the Turing test. They wrote: "[[Aeronautics|Aeronautical engineering]] texts do not define the goal of their field as 'making machines that fly so exactly like [[pigeon]]s that they can fool other pigeons.{{' "}}{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=3}} Other researchers and analysts disagree and have argued that AI should simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]].{{efn|
name="Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general"|
The distinction between "acting humanly" and "acting rationally" is due to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]].{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=3}} [[Pamela McCorduck]] wrote in 2004 that there are "two major branches of artificial intelligence: one aimed at producing intelligent behavior regardless of how it was accomplished, and the other aimed at modeling intelligent processes found in nature, particularly human ones."{{sfnp|McCorduck|2004|pp=100–101}}
}}

The [[intelligent agent]] paradigm<ref name="Intelligent agents">
The [[intelligent agent]] paradigm:
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=27, 32–58, 968–972}}
* {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=7–21}}
* {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=235–240}}
* {{Harvtxt|Hutter|2005|pp=125–126}}
The definition used in this article, in terms of goals, actions, perception and environment, is due to {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}}. Other definitions also include knowledge, learning and autonomy as additional criteria.</ref>
defines intelligent behavior in general, without reference to human beings. An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. Any system that has goal-directed behavior can be analyzed as an intelligent agent: something as simple as a thermostat, as complex as a human being, as well as large systems such as [[firm]]s, [[biome]]s or [[nation]]s. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s, and currently serves as the definition of the field.{{efn|name="Definition of AI"}}

The paradigm has other advantages for AI. It provides a reliable and scientific way to test programs; researchers can directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given "goal function".  It also gives them a common language to communicate with other fields — such as [[mathematical optimization]] (which is defined in terms of "goals") or [[economics]] (which uses the same definition of a "[[rational agent]]").{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=27}}

=== Evaluating approaches to AI ===
No established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] has guided AI research for most of its history.{{efn
|[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] wrote in 1983: "Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about."{{sfnp|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}}} The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostly [[sub-symbolic]], [[neats and scruffies|neat]], [[soft computing|soft]] and [[artificial general intelligence|narrow]] (see below). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. 

==== Symbolic AI and its limits ====
{{Main|Symbolic AI|Physical symbol systems hypothesis|Moravec's paradox|Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence}}

[[Symbolic AI]] (or "[[GOFAI]]"){{sfnp|Haugeland|1985|pp=112–117}} simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the [[physical symbol systems hypothesis]]: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."<ref name="Physical symbol system hypothesis">
Physical symbol system hypothesis:
* {{Harvtxt|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}}
Historical significance:
* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p=153}}
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}
</ref>

However, the symbolic approach failed dismally on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. [[Moravec's paradox]] is the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult.<ref>
[[Moravec's paradox]]:
* {{Harvtxt|Moravec|1988|pp=15–16}}
* {{Harvtxt|Minsky|1986|p=29}}
* {{Harvtxt|Pinker|2007|pp=190–91}}
</ref>
Philosopher [[Hubert Dreyfus]] had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.<ref name="Dreyfus' critique">
[[Dreyfus' critique of AI]]:
* {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|1972}}
* {{Harvtxt |Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}
Historical significance and philosophical implications:
* {{Harvtxt |Crevier|1993|pp=120–132}}
* {{Harvtxt |McCorduck|2004|pp=211–239}}

* {{Harvtxt |Fearn|2007|loc=Chpt. 3}}
</ref>
Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually AI research came to agree.{{efn|
Daniel Crevier wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."{{sfnp|Crevier|1993|p=125}}
}}<ref name="Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning"/>

The issue is not resolved: [[sub-symbolic]] reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as [[algorithmic bias]]. Critics such [[Noam Chomsky]] argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,{{sfnp|Langley|2011}}{{sfnp|Katz|2012}} in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from [[explainable AI]]: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision.

==== Neat vs. scruffy ====
{{Main|Neats and scruffies}}
"Neats" hope that intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]], [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], or [[neural networks]]). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. This issue was actively discussed in the 70s and 80s,<ref name="Neats vs. scruffies">
[[Neats vs. scruffies]], the historic debate:
* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=421–424, 486–489}}

* {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1983|pp=10–11}}

* {{Harvtxt|Domingos|2015}}

but in the 1990s mathematical methods and solid scientific standards became the norm, a transition that Russell and Norvig termed "the victory of the [[Neats and scruffies|neats]]".{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=25-26}}

==== Soft vs. hard computing ====
{{Main|Soft computing}}
Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is [[Intractability (complexity)|intractable]] for many important problems.<ref name="Intractability"/> [[Soft computing]] is a set of techniques, including [[genetic algorithms]], [[fuzzy logic]] and [[neural networks]], that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. [[Soft computing]] was introduced in the late 80s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with [[neural networks]].

==== Narrow vs. general AI ====
{{Main|Artificial general intelligence}}
AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of [[artificial general intelligence]] and [[superintelligence]] (general AI) directly, or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals{{sfnp|Pennachin|Goertzel|2007}}{{sfnp|Roberts|2016}}
General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focussing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of [[artificial general intelligence]] studies this area exclusively.

=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Artificial Consciousness}}
The [[philosophy of mind]] does not know whether a machine can have a [[mind]], [[consciousness]] and [[philosophy of mind|mental states]], in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant, because it does not effect the goals of the field. [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] observe that most AI researchers "don't care about the [philosophy of AI] &mdash; as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence."{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} However, the question has become central to the [[philosophy of mind]]. It is also typically the central question at issue in [[artificial intelligence in fiction]].

==== Consciousness ====
{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}
[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness.{{sfnp|Chalmers|1995}} The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to ''know what red looks like''.{{sfnp|Dennett|1991}}

==== Computationalism and functionalism ====
{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Chinese room}}
Computationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].{{sfnp|Horst|2005}}

Philosopher [[John Searle]] characterized this position as [[strong AI hypothesis|"strong AI"]]: "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."{{efn|name="Searle's strong AI"|
Searle presented this definition of "Strong AI" in 1999.{{sfnp|Searle|1999}} Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."{{sfnp|Searle|1980|p=1}} Strong AI is defined similarly by [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]]: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act ''as if'' they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis."{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}
}}
Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.<ref name="Chinese room">

==== Robot rights ====
{{Main|Robot rights}}
If a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have [[sentience]] (the ability to feel), and if so, then it could also ''suffer'', and thus it would be entitled to certain rights.<ref>
[[Robot rights]]:

</ref>
Any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and human rights.{{sfnp|Evans|2015}}
This issue has been considered in [[artificial intelligence in fiction|fiction]] for centuries,{{sfnp|McCorduck|2004|pp=19–25}}
and is now being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], however critics argue that the discussion is premature.{{sfnp|Henderson|2007}}

A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence, is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ''Superintelligence'' may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.{{sfnp|Roberts|2016}}

<!-- SINGULARITY -->
If research into [[artificial general intelligence]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].{{sfnp|Omohundro|2008}}
Its intelligence would increase exponentially in an [[intelligence explosion]] and could dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named this scenario the "singularity".{{sfnp|Vinge|1993}}
Because it is difficult or impossible to know the limits of intelligence or the capabilities of superintelligent machines, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=963}}

<!-- TRANSHUMANISM -->
Robot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]], and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]].<ref>
[[Transhumanism]]:

* {{Harvtxt|Kurzweil|2005}}
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=963}}
</ref>

<!-- EVOLUTION / HUMAN REPLACEMENT -->
[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s "[[Darwin among the Machines]]" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his book of the same name in 1998.<ref>

</ref>

=== Risks ===
==== Technological unemployment ====
{{Main|Workplace impact of artificial intelligence|Technological unemployment}}

<!-- TOPIC: AMOUNT OF UNEMPLOYMENT -->
In the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI.<ref>
{{Harvtxt|Ford|Colvin|2015}};
{{Harvtxt|McGaughey|2018}}
</ref>
A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term [[unemployment]], but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit, if [[productivity]] gains are [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributed]].{{sfnp|IGM Chicago|2017}}
Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] estimate 47% of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S. jobs as "high risk".{{efn|See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the US average.{{sfnp|Arntz|Gregory|Zierahn|2016|p=33}}}}<ref>
{{Harvtxt|Lohr|2017}};
{{Harvtxt|Frey|Osborne|2017}};
{{Harvtxt|Arntz|Gregory|Zierahn|2016|p=33}}
</ref>

<!-- TOPIC: WHICH JOBS ARE AT RISK? -->
Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; ''[[The Economist]]'' states that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".{{sfnp|Morgenstern|2015}}
Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Mahdawi|2017}}; {{Harvtxt|Thompson|2014}}</ref>

==== Bad actors and weaponized AI ====
{{Main|lethal autonomous weapon|artificial intelligence arms race}}

AI provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for [[authoritarian]] governments: smart [[spyware]], [[Facial recognition system|face recognition]] and [[Speaker recognition|voice recognition]] allow widespread [[surveillance]]; such surveillance allows [[machine learning]] to [[classifier (machine learning)|classify]] potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; [[recommendation systems]] can precisely target [[propaganda]] and [[misinformation]] for maximum effect; [[deepfakes]] aid in producing misinformation; advanced AI can make [[technocracy|centralized decision making]] more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.{{sfnp|Harari|2018}}

Terrorists, criminals and rogue states may use other forms of weaponized AI such as advanced [[digital warfare]] and [[lethal autonomous weapon]]s. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.<ref>
Weaponized AI:
* {{harvtxt|Robitzski|2018}}
* {{harvtxt|Sainato|2015}}
</ref>

==== Algorithmic bias ====
{{Main|algorithmic bias}}

AI programs can become biased after learning from real world data. It is not typically introduced by the system designers, but is learned by the program, and thus the programmers are often unaware that the bias exists.{{sfnp|CNA|2019}}
Bias can be inadvertently introduced by the way [[training data]] is selected.{{sfnp|Goffrey|2008|p=17}}
It can also [[Algorithmic bias#Emergent|emerge]] from [[correlations]]: AI is used to [[statistical classifier|classify]] individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group. In some cases, this assumption may be unfair.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Lipartito|2011|p=36}}; {{Harvtxt|Goodman|Flaxman|2017|p=6}}</ref>
An example of this is [[COMPAS (software)|COMPAS]], a commercial program widely used by [[U.S. court]]s to assess the likelihood of a [[defendant]] becoming a [[recidivist]]. [[ProPublica]] claims that the COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is far more likely to be an overestimate than that of white defendants, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants.{{sfnp|Larson|Angwin|2016}} Other examples where algorithmic bias can lead to unfair outcomes are when AI is used for [[credit rating]] or [[Recruitment|hiring]].

==== Existential risk ====
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|Superintelligence}}

[[Superintelligent]] AI may be able to improve itself to the point that humans could not control it. This could, as physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] puts it, "[[Global catastrophic risk|spell the end of the human race]]".{{sfnp|Cellan-Jones|2014}} Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's, it might need to harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal. He concludes that AI poses a risk to mankind, however humble or "[[Friendly AI|friendly]]" its stated goals might be.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2014}}; {{Harvtxt|Müller|Bostrom|2014}}; {{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2015}}</ref>
Political scientist [[Charles T. Rubin]] argues that "any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence." Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would share our system of morality.{{sfnp|Rubin|2003}}

The opinion of experts and industry insiders is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.{{sfnp|Müller|Bostrom|2014}}
[[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]], history professor [[Yuval Noah Harari]], and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have all expressed serious misgivings about the future of AI.<ref>
Leaders' concerns about the existential risks of AI:
* {{harvtxt|Rawlinson|2015}}
* {{Harvtxt|Holley|2015}}
* {{Harvtxt|Gibbs|2014}}
* {{harvtxt|Churm|2019}}
* {{harvtxt|Sainato|2015}}
</ref>
Prominent tech titans including [[Peter Thiel]] ([[Amazon Web Services]]) and Musk have committed more than $1&nbsp;billion to nonprofit companies that champion responsible AI development, such as [[OpenAI]] and the [[Future of Life Institute]].<ref>
Funding to mitigate risks of AI:
* {{harvtxt|Post|2015}}
* {{Harvtxt|Del Prado|2015}}
* {{Harvtxt|Clark|2015a}}
* {{Harvtxt|FastCompany|2015}}
</ref>
[[Mark Zuckerberg]] (CEO, Facebook) has said that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans.<ref>
Leaders who argue the benefits of AI outweigh the risks:
* {{Harvtxt| Thibodeau |2019}}
* {{Harvtxt| Bhardwaj |2018}}
</ref>
Other experts argue is that the risks are far enough in the future to not be worth researching,
or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.<ref>
Arguments that AI is not an imminent risk:
* {{Harvtxt|Brooks|2014}}
* {{Harvtxt|Geist |2015}}
* {{Harvtxt|Madrigal|2015}}
* {{Harvtxt|Lee |2014}}
</ref>
[[Rodney Brooks]], in particular, has said that "malevolent" AI is still centuries away.{{efn|[[Rodney Brooks]] writes, "I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence."{{sfnp|Brooks|2014}}}}

=== Ethical machines ===
{{Main|Machine ethics|Friendly AI|Artificial moral agents|Human Compatible}}

Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.{{sfnp|Yudkowsky|2008}}

Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.{{sfnp|Anderson|Anderson|2011}}
Machine ethics is also called [[machine morality]], [[computational ethics]] or computational morality,{{sfnp|Anderson|Anderson|2011}}
and was founded at an [[AAAI]] symposium in 2005.{{sfnp|AAAI|2014}}

Others approaches include [[Wendell Wallach]]'s "artificial moral agents"{{sfnp|Wallach|2010}}
and [[Stuart J. Russell]]'s [[Human Compatible#Russell's three principles|three principles]] for developing provably beneficial machines.{{sfnp|Russell|2019|p=173}}

=== Regulation ===
{{Main|Regulation of artificial intelligence|Regulation of algorithms|AI control problem}}
The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.<ref>
Regulation of AI to mitigate risks:
* {{Harvtxt|Berryhill|Heang|Clogher|McBride|2019}}
* {{Harvtxt|Barfield|Pagallo|2018}}
* {{Harvtxt|Iphofen|Kritikos|2019}}
* {{Harvtxt|Wirtz|Weyerer|Geyer|2018}}
* {{Harvtxt|Buiten|2019}}
</ref>
The regulatory and  policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.{{sfnp|Law Library of Congress (U.S.). Global Legal Research Directorate|2019}}
Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.{{sfnp|UNESCO|2021}}
Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, USA and Viet Nam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.{{sfnp|UNESCO|2021}}
The [[Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence]] was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.{{sfnp|UNESCO|2021}} [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Eric Schmidt]], and [[Daniel P. Huttenlocher|Daniel Huttenlocher]] published an joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kissinger|first=Henry|author-link=Henry Kissinger|date=1 November 2021|title=The Challenge of Being Human in the Age of AI|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/being-human-artifical-intelligence-ai-chess-antibiotic-philosophy-ethics-bill-of-rights-11635795271}}</ref>

== In fiction ==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
[[File:Capek play.jpg|thumb|The word "robot" itself was coined by [[Karel Čapek]] in his 1921 play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots"]]

Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,<ref name="AI in myth" />
and have been a persistent theme in [[science fiction]].{{sfnp|McCorduck|2004|pp=340–400}}

A common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in these works began with [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|Arthur C. Clarke's]] and [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|Stanley Kubrick's]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (both 1968), with [[HAL 9000]], the murderous computer in charge of the ''[[Discovery One]]'' spaceship, as well as ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951) and Bishop from ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.{{sfnp|Buttazzo|2001}}

[[Isaac Asimov]] introduced the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] in many books and stories, most notably the "Multivac" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;{{sfnp|Anderson|2008}}
while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.{{sfnp|McCauley|2007}}

[[Transhumanism]] (the merging of humans and machines) is explored in the [[manga]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and the science-fiction series ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.

Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [[sentience|the ability to feel]], and thus to suffer. This appears in [[Karel Čapek]]'s ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the films ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'', as well as the novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.{{sfnp|Galvan|1997}}

[[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]], historian of computing, writes (in what might be called "Dyson's Law") that "Any system simple enough to be understandable will not be complicated enough to behave intelligently, while any system complicated enough to behave intelligently will be too complicated to understand." (p.&nbsp;197.)  Computer scientist [[Alex Pentland]] writes:  "Current [[machine learning|AI machine-learning]] [[algorithm]]s are, at their core, dead simple stupid.  They work, but they work by brute force." (p.&nbsp;198.)

LXVIII, no. 16 (21 October 2021), pp. 29–31. "AI training models can replicate entrenched social and cultural [[bias]]es. [...] Machines only know what they know from the [[data]] they have been given. [p. 30.] [A]rtificial general intelligence–machine-based intelligence that matches our own–is beyond the capacity of [[algorithm]]ic machine learning... 'Your brain is one piece in a broader system which includes your body, your environment, other humans, and culture as a whole.' [E]ven machines that master the tasks they are trained to perform can't jump domains. [[AIVA]], for example, can't drive a car even though it can write music (and wouldn't even be able to do that without [[Bach]] and [[Beethoven]] [and other composers on which AIVA is trained])."

* [[Christof Koch|Koch, Christof]], "Proust among the Machines", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 321, no. 6 (December 2019), pp.&nbsp;46–49. [[Christof Koch]] doubts the possibility of "intelligent" machines attaining [[consciousness]], because "[e]ven the most sophisticated [[brain simulation]]s are unlikely to produce conscious [[feelings]]." (p.&nbsp;48.) According to Koch, "Whether machines can become [[sentience|sentient]] [is important] for [[ethics|ethical]] reasons. If computers experience life through their own senses, they cease to be purely a means to an end determined by their usefulness to... humans. Per GNW [the [[Global Workspace Theory#Global neuronal workspace|Global Neuronal Workspace]] theory], they turn from mere objects into subjects... with a [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]].... Once computers' [[cognitive abilities]] rival those of humanity, their impulse to push for legal and political rights will become irresistible—the right not to be deleted, not to have their memories wiped clean, not to suffer pain and degradation. The alternative, embodied by IIT [Integrated Information Theory], is that computers will remain only supersophisticated machinery, ghostlike empty shells, devoid of what we value most: the feeling of life itself." (p.&nbsp;49.)
* [[Gary Marcus|Marcus, Gary]], "Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp.&nbsp;58–63.  A stumbling block to AI has been an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].  An example is the "pronoun disambiguation problem":  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence refers. (p.&nbsp;61.)

* Scharre, Paul, "Killer Apps:  The Real Dangers of an AI Arms Race", ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', vol. 98, no. 3 (May/June 2019), pp.&nbsp;135–44.  "Today's AI technologies are powerful but unreliable.  Rules-based systems cannot deal with circumstances their programmers did not anticipate.  Learning systems are limited by the data on which they were trained.  AI failures have already led to tragedy.  Advanced autopilot features in cars, although they perform well in some circumstances, have driven cars without warning into trucks, concrete barriers, and parked cars.  In the wrong situation, AI systems go from supersmart to superdumb in an instant.  When an enemy is trying to manipulate and hack an AI system, the risks are even greater."  (p.&nbsp;140.)
