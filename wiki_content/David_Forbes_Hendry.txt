'''Sir David Forbes Hendry''', [[British Academy|FBA]] [[Royal Statistical Society|CStat]] (born 6 March 1944) is a British [[econometrics|econometrician]], currently a professor of economics and from 2001 to 2007 was head of the Economics Department at the University of Oxford. He is also a professorial fellow at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir David F. Hendry, Kt|url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/hendry/|publisher=[[Nuffield College, Oxford]]|access-date=18 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605015408/http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/hendry/|archive-date=5 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

He obtained an M.A. in economics with first class honours from the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1966. He then went to the [[London School of Economics]] and completed an MSc (with distinction) in [[Msc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics|Econometrics and Mathematical Economics]] in 1967.
He received his PhD from the [[London School of Economics]] under the supervision of [[John Denis Sargan]] in 1970, and until joining the University of Oxford as professor of economics in 1982, was a lecturer, then reader and finally professor of economics at the LSE.<ref name = "ET interview" /> Hendry also served as a research professor at [[Duke University]] from 1987 until 1991.

His work is predominantly on time series econometrics and the econometrics of the [[demand for money]]. In recent years he has worked on the theory of forecasting and also on automated model building. He also studies the econometrics of climate change as co-director of the Climate Econometrics research centre at Nuffield College, Oxford.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateeconometrics.org/people/|title=People|date=21 September 2015|website=Climate Econometrics|language=en-GB|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>

He was elected a fellow of the [[British Academy]], a fellow of the [[Econometric Society]], honorary member of the [[American Economic Association]] and foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

In 2001 he received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] (dr. philos. h.c.) from [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary Doctors|website=www.ntnu.edu|language=en|access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 2009 Birthday Honours.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59090 |date=13 June 2009 |page=1 |supp=y}}</ref>

His most recent book is ''Hendry, D.F. and B. Nielsen (2007), Econometric Modeling: A Likelihood Approach'' (Princeton University Press).

"The Methodology and Practice of Econometrics: A Festschrift in Honour of David F. Hendry", edited by Jennifer L Castle and [[Neil Shephard]], was published by Oxford University Press in 2009.
