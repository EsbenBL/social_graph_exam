'''Peter Charles Bonest Phillips''' (born 23 March 1948) is an [[econometrician]]. Since 1979 he has been Professor of Economics and Statistics at [[Yale University]]. He also holds positions at the [[University of Auckland]], [[Singapore Management University]] and the [[University of Southampton]]. He is currently the co-director of Center for Financial Econometrics of Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at [[Singapore Management University]] and is an adjunct professor of econometrics at the [[University of Southampton]].

He is a founding [[editing|editor]] of the journal ''[[Econometric Theory]]''. Peter Phillips has published many theoretical articles and advanced many research areas in [[econometrics]]. He has published important articles on continuous time econometrics, finite-sample theory, [[asymptotic expansions]], [[unit root]] and [[cointegration]], long-range dependent [[time series]], and [[panel data]] econometrics. He also introduced the use of the [[functional central limit theorem]] to derive asymptotic distributions of unit roots tests. Phillips mainly used [[frequentist]] statistical methods.  Phillips has also supervised numerous Ph.D. students, including [[Steven Durlauf|Steve Durlauf]]. In 1993 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 18 December 2016.</ref>
