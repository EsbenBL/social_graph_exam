'''David Gale''' (December 13, 1921&nbsp;– March 7, 2008) was an American [[mathematician]] and [[economist]].  He was a professor emeritus at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], affiliated with the departments of mathematics, economics, and industrial engineering and operations research. He has contributed to the fields of [[mathematical economics]], [[game theory]], and [[convex analysis]].

Gale earned his B.A. from [[Swarthmore College]], obtained an M.A. from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1947, and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Mathematics at [[Princeton University]] in 1949.  He taught at [[Brown University]] from 1950 to 1965 and then joined the faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Gale lived in [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Paris]], [[France]] with his partner [[Sandra Gilbert]], feminist literary scholar and poet.  He has three daughters and two grandsons.

==Contribution==
Gale's contributions to [[mathematical economics]] include an early proof of the existence of competitive [[General equilibrium theory|equilibrium]], his solution of the ''n''-dimensional [[Ramsey problem]], in the theory of optimal economic growth.

Gale and F. M. Stewart initiated the study of infinite games with [[perfect information]]. This work led to fundamental contributions to [[mathematical logic]].

Gale is the inventor of the game of [[Bridg-It]] (also known as "Game of Gale") and [[Chomp]].

Gale played a fundamental role in the development of the theory of [[linear programming]] and linear inequalities. His classic 1960 book ''The Theory of Linear Economic Models'' continues to be a standard reference for this area.

The [[Gale transform]] is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] on sets of points in [[projective space]].  The concept is important in [[optimization]], [[coding theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].

Gale's 1962 paper with [[Lloyd Shapley]] on the [[stable marriage problem]] provides the first formal statement and proof of a problem that has far-reaching implications in many matching markets. The resulting [[Gale–Shapley algorithm]] is currently being applied in New York and Boston public school systems in assigning students to schools. In 2012 The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Shapley for this work.<ref>[[Alvin E.

Gale wrote a Mathematical Entertainments column for ''[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' from 1991 through 1997.  The book ''Tracking the Automatic Ant'' collects these columns.

In 2004 Gale developed MathSite, a pedagogic website that uses interactive exhibits to illustrate important mathematical ideas.  MathSite won the 2007 [[Pirelli Internetional Award]] for Science Communication in Mathematics.
