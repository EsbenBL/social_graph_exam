{{Politics of the United States}}

The '''United States Congress''' is the [[legislature]] of the [[federal government of the United States]]. It is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], comprising a lower body, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and an upper body, the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The Congress meets in the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Both senators and representatives are chosen through [[direct election]], though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a [[Governor (United States)|governor]]'s appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The [[Vice President of the United States]] has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided; the House of Representatives has six [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting members]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45583|title=Membership of the 116th Congress: A Profile|page=4|website=[[Congressional Research Service]]|access-date=5 March 2020|quote=Congress is composed of 541 individuals from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico.|archive-date=January 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210114214342/https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45583|url-status=live}}</ref>

The sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present beginning every other January; the current Congress is the 117th. [[Elections in the United States|Elections]] are held every even-numbered year on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]] establishes that they be elected in single-member constituencies or ''districts'' by [[first-past-the-post]] and that [[Congressional districts of the United States|Congressional districts]] be [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] to [[U.S. state|states]] by [[Representation by population|population]] every ten years using the [[United States Census]] results, provided that each state has at least one Congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with [[Staggered elections|terms staggered]], so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution]] requires that members of Congress must be at least 25 years old (House) or 30 years old (Senate), have been a citizen of the United States for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the [[U.S. state|state]] which they represent. Members in both chambers may stand for re-election an unlimited number of times.

The Congress was created by the [[Constitution of the United States]] and first met in 1789, replacing in its legislative function the [[Congress of the Confederation]]. Although not legally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated with one of the [[Two-party system|two major parties]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] or the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and only rarely with a [[Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives|third party]] or [[Independent (politician)|independents]] affiliated with no party. In the case of the latter, the lack of affiliation with a political party does not mean that such members are unable caucus with members of the political parties.

==Overview==
[[File:The United States Legislative Process Overview (1) - Library of Congress.webm|thumb|Overview of the United States legislative process, as explained by the [[Library of Congress]]]]
[[Article One of the United States Constitution]] states, "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives." The House and Senate are equal partners in the legislative process{{snd}}legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers. However, the Constitution grants each chamber some unique powers. The Senate ratifies treaties and approves [[President of the United States|presidential]] appointments while the House initiates [[revenue]]-raising bills.

The term ''[[Congress]]'' can also refer to a particular meeting of the legislature. A Congress covers two years; the current one, the [[117th United States Congress|117th Congress]], began on January 3, 2021, and will end on January 3, 2023. Since the adoption of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the Congress has started and ended at noon on the third day of January of every odd-numbered year. Members of the Senate are referred to as senators; members of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives, Congressmen, or Congresswomen.

Scholar and representative [[Lee H. Hamilton]] asserted that the "historic mission of Congress has been to maintain freedom" and insisted it was a "driving force in American government"<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14aa/> and a "remarkably resilient institution".<ref name=tws2010Sep11rtww>{{cite news |author1=Steven S.

The Congress of the United States serves two distinct purposes that overlap: local representation to the federal government of a Congressional district by representatives and a state's at-large representation to the federal government by senators.

Most incumbents seek re-election, and their historical likelihood of winning subsequent elections exceeds 90 percent.<ref name=incumbent>{{cite news|author = Perry Bacon Jr.|title = Post Politics Hour: Weekend Review and a Look Ahead|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = August 31, 2009|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/08/27/DI2009082703265.html|access-date = September 20, 2009|archive-date = January 14, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210114215514/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/08/27/DI2009082703265.html|url-status = live}}</ref>

The historical records of the House of Representatives and the Senate are maintained by the Center for Legislative Archives, which is a part of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Information_about_Senate_Archives.htm|title = Information about the Archives of the United States Senate|access-date = January 6, 2014|publisher = U.S. Senate}}</ref>

Political scientist [[Julian E.

The [[Gilded Age]] (1877–1901) was marked by [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] dominance of Congress. During this time, lobbying activity became more intense, particularly during the administration of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in which influential lobbies advocated for railroad subsidies and tariffs on wool.<ref>Margaret S. Thompson, ''The "Spider Web": Congress and Lobbying in the Age of Grant'' (1985)</ref> Immigration and high birth rates swelled the ranks of citizens and the nation grew at a rapid pace. The [[Progressive Era]] was characterized by strong party leadership in both houses of Congress as well as calls for reform; sometimes reformers would attack lobbyists as corrupting politics.<ref>Elisabeth S. Clemens, ''The People's Lobby: Organizational Innovation and the Rise of Interest-Group Politics in the United States, 1890–1925'' (1997)</ref> The position of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] became extremely powerful under leaders such as [[Thomas Brackett Reed|Thomas Reed]] in 1890 and [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]]. The Senate was effectively controlled by a half dozen men.

===Women in Congress===
Various social and structural barriers have prevented women from gaining seats in Congress. In the early 20th century, [[cult of domesticity|women’s domestic roles]] and the inability to vote forestalled opportunities to run for and hold public office. The two party system and the lack of term limits favored incumbent white men, making the [[Widow's succession]] – in which a woman temporarily took over a seat vacated by the death of her husband – the most common path to Congress for white women. {{sfn|Sanbonmatsu|2020|p=42-43}}

Women candidates began making substantial inroads in the later 20th century, due in part to new political support mechanisms and public awareness of their underrepresentation in Congress. {{sfn|Sanbonmatsu|2020|p=45}} Recruitment and financial support for women candidates were rare until the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminism movement]], when activists moved into electoral politics. Beginning in the 1970s, donors and political-action-committees like [[Emily’s List|EMILY's List]] began recruiting, training and funding women candidates. Watershed political moments like the [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|confirmation of Clarence Thomas]] and the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] created momentum for women candidates, resulting in the [[Year of the Woman]] and the election of members of [[The Squad (United States Congress)|The Squad]], respectively.

Women of color faced additional challenges that made their ascension to Congress even more difficult. [[Jim Crow laws]], [[voter suppression in the United States|voter suppression]] and other forms of structural racism made it virtually impossible for women of color to reach Congress prior to 1965. The passage of the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act that year]], and the elimination of race-based immigration laws in the 1960s opened the possibility for Black, Asian American, Latina and other non-white women candidates to run for Congress.{{sfn|Sanbonmatsu|2020|p=44-45}}

Still, racially polarized voting, racial stereotypes and lack of institutional support prevented, and continue to prevent, women of color from reaching Congress as easily as their white counterparts. Senate elections, which require victories in statewide electorates, have been particularly difficult for women color. {{sfn|Sanbonmatsu|2020|p=42}} [[Carol Moseley Braun]] became the first woman of color to reach the Senate in 1993. The second woman of color, [[Mazie Hirono]], was not seated until 2013.

===Powers of Congress===
{{Main|Powers of the United States Congress}}

====Overview of Congressional power====
[[File:USCurrency Federal Reserve.jpg|thumb|alt=$100,000-dollar bill.|Congress's "[[power of the purse]]" authorizes taxing citizens, spending money, and printing currency.]]
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One of the Constitution]] creates and sets forth the structure and most of the powers of Congress. Sections One through Six describe how Congress is elected and gives each House the power to create its own structure. Section Seven lays out the process for creating laws, and Section Eight enumerates numerous powers. Section Nine is a list of powers Congress does not have, and Section Ten enumerates powers of the state, some of which may only be granted by Congress.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Epps|first1=Garrett|title=American Epic: Reading the U.S. Constitution|date=2013|publisher=Oxford|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-938971-1|page=9}}</ref> [[Constitutional amendment]]s have granted Congress additional powers. Congress also has [[implied powers]] derived from the Constitution's [[Necessary and Proper Clause]].

Congress has authority over financial and budgetary policy through the enumerated power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States". There is vast authority over budgets, although analyst Eric Patashnik suggested that much of Congress's power to manage the budget has been lost when the welfare state expanded since "entitlements were institutionally detached from Congress's ordinary legislative routine and rhythm."<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14dd2>{{cite news | author= Eric Patashnik | title= The American Congress: The Building of Democracy | publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company | pages= 671–2 | year= 2004 | isbn= 0-618-17906-2 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_MGEIIwT5pUC&q=Zelizer+Julian+2004+American+Congress+The+Building+of+Democracy | access-date= September 11, 2010 | archive-date= October 19, 2017 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171019131704/https://books.google.com/books?id=_MGEIIwT5pUC | url-status= live }}</ref> Another factor leading to less control over the budget was a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] belief that balanced budgets were unnecessary.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14dd2/>

The [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] in 1913 extended Congressional power of taxation to include [[income tax]]es without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.<ref name="davidson-p18">Davidson (2006), p. 18</ref> The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds, and this ''[[power of the purse]]'' is one of Congress's primary [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution#Checks and balances|checks]] on the executive branch.<ref name="davidson-p18"/> Congress can borrow money on the credit of the United States, [[Commerce Clause|regulate commerce]] with foreign nations and among the states, and coin money.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t9>{{cite news | title= Congress and the Dollar | newspaper= New York Sun | date= May 30, 2008 | url= http://www.nysun.com/editorials/congress-and-the-dollar/78978/ | access-date= September 11, 2010 | archive-date= August 1, 2020 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200801071404/https://www.nysun.com/editorials/congress-and-the-dollar/78978/ | url-status= live }}</ref> Generally, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have equal legislative authority, although only the House may originate revenue and [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation bills]].<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>

They "possess the same powers as other members of the House, except that they may not vote when the House is meeting as the House of Representatives".

Representative [[Lee H. Hamilton]] explained how Congress functions within the federal government:

<blockquote>To me the key to understanding it is balance. The founders went to great lengths to balance institutions against each other{{snd}}balancing powers among the three branches: Congress, the president, and the Supreme Court; between the House of Representatives and the Senate; between the federal government and the states; among states of different sizes and regions with different interests; between the powers of government and the rights of citizens, as spelled out in the Bill of Rights{{nbs}}...

[[File:Senate in session.jpg|thumb|The [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment trial of President Clinton]] in 1999, [[William H. Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]

The Constitution concentrates removal powers in the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] both executive and judicial officials for "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors". Impeachment is a ''formal accusation'' of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official. The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the [[defendant]] be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this; however, a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law. In the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial. Only three presidents have ever been impeached: [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1868, [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, [[Donald Trump]] in 2019 and 2021. The [[trial (law)|trials]] of Johnson, Clinton, and the 2019 trial of Trump all ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for [[conviction (law)|conviction]]. In 1974, [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the [[House Judiciary Committee]] indicated he would eventually be removed from office.

The Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] officials, judges, and other high officers "by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate". It confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon. Furthermore, treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to take effect. As a result, presidential arm-twisting of senators can happen before a key vote; for example, President Obama's secretary of state, [[Hillary Clinton]], urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with Russia in 2010.<ref name=tws2010Sep11rr>{{cite news |author= Charles Wolfson |title= Clinton Presses Senate to Ratify Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia

In 1803, the Supreme Court established [[judicial review]] of federal legislation in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws [[unconstitutional]] was envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in [[Federalist No. 78]]. [[Originalism|Originalists]] on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might, or could have said.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legal_issues/legal_updates/us_supreme_court/scalia-constitutional-speech.htm |title=Constitutional Interpretation the Old Fashioned Way |publisher=Center For Individual Freedom |access-date=September 15, 2007 |archive-date=January 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210114214412/https://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legal_issues/legal_updates/us_supreme_court/scalia-constitutional-speech.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a Congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits Congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a Congressional act of 1820 in its [[Dred Scott]] decision.<ref name=tws2010Sep11ss>{{cite news |title= Decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott Case |newspaper= The New York Times |date= March 6, 1851 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0306.html |access-date= September 11, 2010 |archive-date= January 14, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210114214440/https://www.nytimes.com/section/learning |url-status= live }}</ref> At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend Congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.

==Structure==
{{Main|Structure of the United States Congress}}
Congress is split into two chambers{{snd}}House and Senate{{snd}}and manages the task of writing national legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the [[Government Accountability Office]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.

{{Main|United States congressional committee}}

====Specializations====
The committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely. It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress.<ref name="english-46">English (2003), pp. 46–47</ref> As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects. [[United States congressional committee|Committees]] investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade-offs. The choice of specialty may be influenced by the member's constituency, important regional issues, prior background and experience.<ref>English, p. 46</ref> Senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap.<ref>{{cite book |author=Schiller, Wendy J. |title=Partners and Rivals: Representation in U.S. Senate Delegations |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-691-04887-8}}</ref> Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the [[House Ways and Means Committee]] has considerable influence over House affairs.<ref name=tws2010Sep11ff511234>{{cite news |title= Committees |publisher= U.S. Senate |year= 2010 |url= https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/committees/d_three_sections_with_teasers/committees_home.htm |access-date= September 12, 2010 |archive-date= January 14, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210114214410/https://www.senate.gov/committees/index.htm |url-status= live }}</ref>

====Power====
Committees write legislation. While procedures, such as the House [[discharge petition]] process, can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action. Committees have power and have been called ''independent fiefdoms''. Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and [[United States congressional subcommittee|subcommittees]] which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems.<ref name="House_Rules"/> They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber.<ref name="House_Rules"/> In addition, they perform the function of ''oversight'' by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing.<ref name="House_Rules">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162313/http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/98-241.pdf Committee Types and Roles], [[Congressional Research Service]], April 1, 2003</ref>

====Officer====
At the start of each two-year session, the House elects a [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]] who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader. In the Senate, the vice president is the [[ex officio]] ''president'' of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]]. ''Pro tempore'' means ''for the time being'' and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there is a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.

====Library of Congress====
[[File:Thomas Jefferson Building Aerial by Carol M. Highsmith.jpg|thumb|Library of Congress Jefferson Building]]
{{Main|Library of Congress}}
The Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800. It is primarily housed in three buildings on [[Capitol Hill]], but also includes several other sites: the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] in Washington, D.C.; the [[National Audio-Visual Conservation Center]] in Culpeper, Virginia; a large [[book storage]] facility located at Fort Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices. The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the [[War of 1812]], but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private library. One of the library's missions is to serve Congress and its staff as well as the American public. It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books, films, maps, photographs, music, manuscripts, graphics, and materials in 470 languages.<ref name=aboutLOC>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/about/generalinfo.html|title=General Information – Library of Congress|website=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=December 30, 2017|archive-date=February 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224004300/http://www.loc.gov/about/generalinfo.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Congressional Research Service====
[[File:Congressional Research Service.svg|alt=|thumb]]
{{Main|Congressional Research Service}}
The Congressional Research Service, part of the Library of Congress, provides detailed, up-to-date and non-partisan research for senators, representatives, and their staff to help them carry out their official duties. It provides ideas for legislation, helps members analyze a bill, facilitates public hearings, makes reports, consults on matters such as parliamentary procedure, and helps the two chambers resolve disagreements. It has been called the "House's think tank" and has a staff of about 900 employees.<ref name="CRS Report about CRS">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33471.pdf|title=The Congressional Research Service and the American Legislative Process|year=2008|publisher=Congressional Research Service|access-date=July 25, 2009|archive-date=July 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718113918/http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33471.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Congressional Budget Office====
{{Main|Congressional Budget Office}}
The Congressional Budget Office or CBO is a [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]] which provides [[economics|economic data]] to Congress.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = O'Sullivan |first1 = Arthur |author-link = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2 = Steven M. |last2 = Sheffrin |title = Economics: Principles in Action |url = https://archive.org/details/economicsprincip00osul |url-access = limited |publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 |location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 |page = [https://archive.org/details/economicsprincip00osul/page/n404 388] |isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}</ref>

It was created as an independent non-partisan agency by the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]]. It helps Congress estimate revenue inflows from taxes and helps the budgeting process. It makes projections about such matters as the [[national debt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/ |title=Congressional Budget Office – About CBO |publisher=Cbo.gov |access-date=December 20, 2010 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205015731/http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/ |archive-date=December 5, 2010 }}</ref> as well as likely costs of legislation. It prepares an annual ''Economic and Budget Outlook'' with a mid-year update and writes ''An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals'' for the [[Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate's Appropriations Committee]]. The speaker of the House and the Senate's president pro tempore jointly appoint the CBO director for a four-year term.

====Lobbyists====

{{Main|Lobbying in the United States}}
{{Advert section|date=August 2021}}
Lobbyists represent diverse interests and often seek to influence Congressional decisions to reflect their clients' needs. [[Advocacy group|Lobby groups]] and their members sometimes write legislation and [[Whip (politics)|whip]] bills. In 2007, there were approximately 17,000 federal lobbyists in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite book |title=Washington Representatives|edition=32|date=November 2007|publisher=Columbia Books|location=Bethesda, MD|isbn=978-1-880873-55-7|page=949}}</ref> They explain to legislators the goals of their organizations. Some lobbyists represent non-profit organizations and work [[pro bono]] for issues in which they are personally interested.

===Partisanship versus bipartisanship===
Congress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties, known as [[bipartisanship]], and periods of deep political [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] and fierce infighting, known as [[partisanship]]. The period after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was marked by partisanship, as is the case today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some [[Political science|political scientists]] speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades, but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies, as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc577>{{cite book |author1=Steven S.

==Procedures==
{{Main|Procedures of the United States Congress}}

===Sessions===
A term of Congress is divided into two "[[legislative session|sessions]]", one for each year; Congress has occasionally been called into an extra or ''[[special session]]''. A new session commences on January{{nbs}}3 each year unless Congress decides differently. The Constitution requires Congress to meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.

===Joint sessions===
{{Main|Joint session of the United States Congress}}
Joint sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both House and Senate. These sessions include counting [[electoral votes]] after a presidential election and the president's [[State of the Union]] address. The [[State of the Union|constitutionally mandated report]], normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's [[Speech from the Throne]], was written by most presidents after [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] in 1913. Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the House, except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president (acting as the president of the Senate) presides.

===Bills and resolutions===

Ideas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies. Anyone can write a bill, but only members of Congress may introduce bills. Most bills are not written by Congress members, but originate from the Executive branch; interest groups often draft bills as well. The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A proposal is usually in one of these forms:

*'''Bills''' are laws in the making. A House-originated bill begins with the letters "H.R." for "House of Representatives", followed by a number kept as it progresses.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>
*'''Joint resolutions'''. There is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly; a joint resolution originating from the House, for example, begins "H.J.Res." followed by its number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>
*'''Concurrent Resolutions''' affect only the House and Senate and accordingly are not presented to the president. In the House, they begin with "H.Con.Res."<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>
*'''Simple resolutions''' concern only the House or only the Senate and begin with "H.Res." or "S.Res."<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>

Representatives introduce a bill while the House is in session by placing it in the ''hopper'' on the Clerk's desk.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> It is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Drafting statutes requires "great skill, knowledge, and experience" and sometimes take a year or more.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction. Joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war. On the other hand, concurrent resolutions (passed by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have the force of law but express the opinion of Congress or regulate [[Parliamentary procedure|procedure]]. Bills may be introduced by any member of either house. However, the Constitution states, "All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives." While the Senate cannot originate [[revenue]] and [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation bills]], it has the power to amend or reject them. Congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>

Each chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law. In the House, a [[U.S. House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]] guides legislation; in the Senate, a [[Standing Rules of the Senate|Standing Rules]] committee is in charge. Each branch has its own traditions; for example, the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting "unanimous consent" for noncontroversial matters.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> House and Senate rules can be complex, sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before a bill can become a law.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14aa/> Members sometimes turn to outside experts to learn about proper Congressional procedures.<ref name=tws2010Sep11nn>{{cite news |author= Partnership for Public Service |title= Walter Oleszek: A Hill Staffer's Guide to Congressional History and Habit |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= March 29, 2009 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032701563.html |access-date= September 11, 2010 |archive-date= January 14, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210114214454/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032701563.html |url-status= live }}</ref>

Each bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the [[Government Accountability Office]].<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Most legislation is considered by [[standing committee]]s which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A committee might call for public hearings on important bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Each committee is led by a [[chairperson|chair]] who belongs to the majority party and a [[ranking minority member|ranking member]] of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Then, a bill may go to what is called a ''mark-up'' session, where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is ''tabled'' then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called ''clean bill'' with a new number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.<ref name=tws2010Sep11qq/>

A bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> and begins with an [[enacting formula]] such as "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled{{nbs}}..." Consideration of a bill requires, itself, a ''rule'' which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate{{snd}}time limits, possibility of further amendments, and such.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Sometimes opponents seek to ''recommit'' a bill which means to change part of it.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Generally, discussion requires a ''quorum'', usually half of the total number of representatives, before discussion can begin, although there are exceptions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11mm>{{cite news |title= News from Washington |newspaper= The New York Times |date= December 3, 1861 |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30611FA38541A7493C1A91789D95F458684F9 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010131909/http://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/03/news/washington-meeting-thirty-seventh-congress-quorum-present-both-houses-business.html |url-status = dead|archive-date= October 10, 2017 |access-date= September 11, 2010 }}</ref> The house may debate and amend the bill; the precise procedures used by the House and Senate differ. A final vote on the bill follows.

Once a bill is approved by one house, it is sent to the other which may pass, reject, or amend it. For the bill to become law, both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> If the second house amends the bill, then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]], an ''ad hoc'' committee that includes both senators and representatives<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> sometimes by using a ''reconciliation process'' to limit budget bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as ''pay-as-you-go'' or ''paygo'' which discourages members from considering acts that increase budget deficits.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.

The Constitution specifies that a majority of members (a [[quorum]]) be present before doing business in each house. However, the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a [[quorum call]] demonstrates the contrary and debate often continues despite the lack of a majority.

Voting within Congress can take many forms, including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout "aye" or "no" and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, requires a [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|recorded vote]] if demanded by one-fifth of the members present or when voting to override a presidential veto. If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial, a recorded vote usually happens. The Senate uses [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll-call voting]], in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators, each senator stating "aye" or "no" when their name is announced. In the Senate, the Vice President may cast the tie-breaking vote if present when the senators are equally divided.

The House reserves roll-call votes for the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. Most votes in the House are done electronically, allowing members to vote ''yea'' or ''nay'' or ''present'' or ''open''.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Members insert a voting ''ID card'' and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used occasionally (''yea'' indicated by green and ''nay'' by red).<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> One member cannot cast a [[proxy vote]] for another.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.<ref name=tws2010Sep11gg>{{cite news |author= United States government |title= Recent Votes |publisher= United States Senate |year= 2010 |url= https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm |access-date= September 11, 2010 |archive-date= January 14, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210114214426/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/votes_new.htm |url-status= live }}</ref><ref name=tws2010Sep11t7>{{cite news|title=The U.S. Congress – Votes Database – Members of Congress / Robert Byrd |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |access-date=September 11, 2010 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110035120/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |archive-date=November 10, 2010 }}</ref>

After passage by both houses, a bill is [[Enrolled bill|enrolled]] and sent to the president for approval.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> The president may sign it making it law or veto it, perhaps returning it to Congress with the president's objections. A vetoed bill can still become law if each house of Congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority. Finally, the president may do nothing{{nbs}}neither signing nor vetoing the bill{{nbs}}and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days (not counting Sundays) according to the Constitution. But if Congress is adjourned during this period, presidents may veto legislation passed at the end of a Congressional session simply by ignoring it; the maneuver is known as a [[pocket veto]], and cannot be overridden by the adjourned Congress.

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has treated campaign contributions as a [[free speech]] issue.<ref name="tws01oct38"/> Some see money as a good influence in politics since it "enables candidates to communicate with voters".<ref name="tws01oct38"/> Few members retire from Congress without complaining about how much it costs to campaign for reelection.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/> Critics contend that members of Congress are more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/>

Elections are influenced by many variables. Some political scientists speculate there is a ''[[coattail effect]]'' (when a popular president or party position has the effect of reelecting incumbents who win by "riding on the president's coattails"), although there is some evidence that the coattail effect is irregular and possibly declining since the 1950s.<ref name=tws2010Sep11jggha/> Some districts are so heavily Democratic or Republican that they are called a [[safe seat]]; any candidate winning the primary will almost always be elected, and these candidates do not need to spend money on advertising.<ref name=tws30sep13>{{cite news| author = John Balzar| title = Democrats Battle Over a Safe Seat in Congress| newspaper = Los Angeles Times| date = May 24, 2006| url = https://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/24/local/me-harman24| access-date = September 30, 2009| archive-date = January 14, 2021| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210114214422/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-may-24-me-harman24-story.html| url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=tws30sep14>{{cite news| title = The Congress: An Idea on the March| newspaper = Time| date = January 11, 1963| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873000-5,00.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110501130131/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873000-5,00.html| url-status = dead| archive-date = May 1, 2011| access-date =September 30, 2009}}</ref> But some races can be competitive when there is no incumbent.

An additional factor that confounds public perceptions of Congress is that Congressional issues are becoming more technical and complex and require expertise in subjects such as science, engineering and economics.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/> As a result, Congress often cedes authority to experts at the executive branch.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/>

===Smaller states and bigger states===
When the Constitution was ratified in 1787, the ratio of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one. The [[Connecticut Compromise]] gave every state, large and small, an equal vote in the Senate.<ref name=tws10janx01>{{cite web|title= Roger Sherman and The Connecticut Compromise|publisher= Connecticut Judicial Branch: Law Libraries|date= January 10, 2010|url= http://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/History/Sherman.htm|access-date=January 10, 2010}}</ref> Since each state has two senators, residents of smaller states have more clout in the Senate than residents of larger states. But since 1787, the population disparity between large and small states has grown; in 2006, for example, [[California]] had seventy times the population of [[Wyoming]].<ref name=tws10janx334>{{cite news|author=Cass R.

===Congressional style===
One way to categorize lawmakers, according to political scientist [[Richard Fenno]], is by their general motivation:

# '''''Reelection'''''. These are lawmakers who "never met a voter they didn't like" and provide excellent constituent services.
# '''''Good public policy'''''. Legislators who "burnish a reputation for policy expertise and leadership".
# '''''Power in the chamber'''''. Lawmakers who spend serious time along the "rail of the House floor or in the Senate cloakroom ministering to the needs of their colleagues". Famous legislator [[Henry Clay]] in the mid-19th century was described as an "issue entrepreneur" who looked for issues to serve his ambitions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14bb/>{{rp|34}}

==Privileges and pay==
===Privileges protecting members===
Members of Congress enjoy [[parliamentary privilege]], including [[Parliamentary immunity|freedom from arrest]] in all cases except for [[treason]], [[felony]], and [[breach of the peace]], and freedom of speech in debate. This constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions.<ref>Davidson (2006), p. 17</ref> The term ''arrest'' has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay in the course of [[Police|law enforcement]], including [[Summons|court summons]] and [[subpoena]]s. The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules, however, are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

The Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses, providing in the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of the Constitution that "for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place." Accordingly, a member of Congress may not be sued in court for [[slander]] because of remarks made in either house, although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches, and may punish members who transgress.<ref>{{cite web |title=Congressional Immunity |url=https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1952042500 |website=CQ Press |publisher=CQ Press |access-date=16 January 2021}}</ref>

Obstructing the work of Congress is a crime under [[federal law]] and is known as [[contempt of Congress]]. Each member has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation{{snd}}the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case. If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1296619169 |url-access=registration |title=Contempt of Congress |date=January 1, 1957 |website=[[HeinOnline]] |publisher=[[The Jurist (journal)|The Jurist]] |language=en |volume=17 |id={{ProQuest|1296619169}} |access-date=September 7, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210114214434/https://search.proquest.com/docview/1296619169 |archive-date=January 14, 2021}}</ref>

The [[franking]] privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense. Though they are not permitted to send election materials, borderline material is often sent, especially in the run-up to an election by those in close races.<ref>English (2003), pp. 24–25</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Simpson, G.

Members elected since 1984 are covered by the [[Federal Employees Retirement System]] (FERS). Like other federal employees, Congressional retirement is funded through taxes and participants' contributions. Members of Congress under FERS contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2% of their salary in Social Security taxes. And like federal employees, members contribute one-third of the cost of health insurance with the government covering the other two-thirds.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Walter | last=Scott | title=Personality Parade column:Q. Does Congress pay for its own health care? | publisher=Parade | location=New York, NY | page= 2 | date=April 25, 2010 }}</ref>

The size of a Congressional pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest three years of their salary. By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of their final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under the [[Civil Service Retirement System]] (CSRS) was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30631.pdf Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103064138/https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30631.pdf |date=January 3, 2018 }} (PDF).

Members of Congress make fact-finding missions to learn about other countries and stay informed, but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected with the task of governing. For example, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in 2009 that lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense had included spas, $300-per-night extra unused rooms, and shopping excursions.<ref name=tws17decaafds/> Lawmakers respond that "traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in Washington" and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations.<ref name=tws17decaafds>{{cite news|author1 = Brody Mullins|author2 = T.W.

By the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]], changes to Congressional pay may not take effect before the next election to the House of the Representatives. In ''Boehner v. Anderson'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] ruled that the amendment does not affect [[Cost-of-living index|cost-of-living adjustments]].<ref>30 [[Federal Reporter|F.3d]] 156 (D.C. Cir. 1994)</ref> The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has not ruled on this.
