}}'''Hadley P. Arkes''' (born 1940) is an American political scientist and the Edward N. Ney Professor of Jurisprudence and American Institutions ''emeritus'' at [[Amherst College]], where he has taught since 1966. He is currently the founder and director of the James Wilson Institute on Natural Rights & the American Founding in Washington, D.C.

== Education ==
Arkes received a B.A. degree at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] where he was a student of [[Leo Strauss]].<ref>Hadley Arkes, 1995. "Strauss and the Religion of Reason," ''National Review'', 47(12), June 26, pp. [http://www.spiritual-minds.com/religion/philosophy/Strauss%20(Leo)%20-%20Religion%20Reason.pdf pp. 60–63]. Accessed 08-28-10.</ref>

== Career ==
In a series of books and articles dating from the mid-1980s, Arkes has written on ''a priori'' moral principles and advocated for their impact on constitutional interpretation. He has also dealt with their relation to constitutional [[jurisprudence]] and [[natural law]], and their  challenge to [[moral relativism]]. His works draw on political philosophers from [[Aristotle]] through the U.S. [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], and contemporary authors and jurists.

John O. McGinnis, reviewing Arkes' ''Constitutional Illusions & Anchoring Truths'' in ''The Wall Street Journal'', writes that it tries to find a path between the extremes of [[originalism]], where the meaning of the U. S.Constitution is fixed by its original text, and the idea of the living constitution, where its meaning is updated by evolving moral principles.<ref>{{cite news |title=When Justice Comes Naturally |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 27, 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703447004575448761803060070 }}</ref>
