Zakaria is the author of ''From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America's World Role'' (Princeton, 1998), ''[[The Future of Freedom]]'' (Norton, 2003), ''[[The Post-American World]]'' (2008), and ''In Defense of a Liberal Education'' (Norton, 2015).

Hoge Jr. His last three books have both been New York Times bestsellers and The Future of Freedom and The Post American World have both been translated into more than 25 languages. In 2011 an updated and expanded edition of ''The Post-American World'' ("Release 2.0") was published.

Zakaria was a news analyst with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with George Stephanopoulos]]'' (2002–2007) where he was a member of the Sunday morning roundtable. He hosted the weekly TV news show, ''[[Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria]]'' on [[PBS]] (2005–08). His weekly show, ''[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]]'' (''Global Public Square''), premiered on [[CNN]] in June 2008.<ref name="zcom" /> It airs twice weekly in the United States and four times weekly on CNN International, reaching over 200 million homes. It celebrated its 10th anniversary on 5 June 2018, as announced on the weekly foreign affairs show on CNN.

Zakaria, a member of the [[Berggruen Institute]], additionally features as an interlocutor for the annual [[The Berggruen Prize|Berggruen Prize]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/onora-oneill-berggruen-institute|title=Pondering Humanity, Technology, and Net Neutrality at the Berggruen Institute Gala|last=Binlot|first=Ann|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/nicolas-berggruen-philosophy-prize-333452|title=Nicolas Berggruen's $1 Million Philosophy Prize - artnet News|date=2015-09-17|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/charles-taylor-accepts-million-dollar-prize-1.3187270|title=Charles Taylor accepts million-dollar prize|date=2016-12-02|work=Montreal|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-CA}}</ref>

==Political views==
Zakaria self-identifies as a "[[Centrism|centrist]]",<ref name=voice>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-08-09/news/the-interpreter/2|title=The Interpreter|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=9 August 2005|author=Press, Joy}}</ref> though he has been described variously as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]],<ref name=forbes>[https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/22/influential-media-obama-oped-cx_tv_ee_hra_0122liberal_slide_16.html?thisSpeed=15000 In Depth: The 25 Most Influential Liberals In The U.S. Media].

In January 2009 ''[[Forbes]]'' referred to Zakaria as one of the 25 most influential liberals in the [[American media]].<ref name=forbes/> Zakaria has stated that he tries not to be devoted to any type of ideology, saying "I feel that's part of my job... which is not to pick sides but to explain what I think is happening on the ground. I can't say, 'This is my team and I'm going to root for them no matter what they do.'"<ref name=voice/>

As a student at [[Yale University]] in the mid-1980s, Zakaria opposed anti-apartheid divestment and argued that Yale should not divest from its holdings in [[South Africa]].<ref>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBAQuxbXYAAkEus.jpg</ref>

Zakaria "may have more intellectual range and insights than any other public thinker in the West," wrote David Shribman in ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shribman |first=David M. |title=Globalization, its discontents, and its upside |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/06/01/globalization_its_discontents_and_its_upside/ |work=The Boston Globe |date=1 June 2008 |access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> In 2003, former Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' that Zakaria "has a first-class mind and likes to say things that run against conventional wisdom."<ref name=world /> However, in 2011, the editors of ''[[The New Republic]]'' included him in a list of "over-rated thinkers" and commented, "There's something suspicious about a thinker always so perfectly in tune with the moment."<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Over-Rated Thinkers |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/96141/over-rated-thinkers |work=The New Republic |date=3 November 2011 |access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref>

Zakaria's books include ''[[The Future of Freedom]]'' and ''[[The Post-American World]]''. ''The Future of Freedom'' argues that what is defined as democracy in the Western world is actually "[[liberal democracy]]", a combination of [[constitutional liberalism]] and participatory politics. Zakaria points out that protection of liberty and the rule of law actually preceded popular elections by centuries in Western Europe, and that when countries only adopt elections without the protection of liberty, they create "[[illiberal democracy]]". ''The Post-American World'', published in 2008 before the financial crisis, argued that the most important trend of modern times is the "rise of the rest," the economic emergence of China, India, Brazil, and other countries.<ref name="wapost">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/15/AR2008051504202.html|title=The Rise of Non-Americanism|last=Khanna|first=Parag|date=18 May 2008|work=The Washington Post|access-date=13 May 2012}}</ref>

From 2006, Zakaria has also criticized what he views as "fear-based" American policies employed not only in combating terrorism, but also in enforcing immigration and drug smuggling laws, and has argued in favor of decriminalization of drugs and citizenship for presently illegal immigrants to the United States of all backgrounds.<ref>Intelligence 2 Ltd., ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720062937/http://www.intelligencesquared.com/events/america-is-to-blame-for-mexicos-drug-war America is to blame for Mexico's drug war]'', 1 December 2009, retrieved 24 April 2011</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Zakaria |first=Fareed |date=3 May 2008 |title=Excerpt: Zakaria's 'The Post-American World' |url=http://www.newsweek.com/excerpt-zakarias-post-american-world-89645 |work=Newsweek |access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref><ref>''[http://www.cc.com/video-clips/4h35c9/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-fareed-zakaria-pt--1 Interview with Fareed Zakaria, Part 1]'', [[The Daily Show]] with Jon Stewart, 28 March 2006: "We are not going to deport them (illegal immigrants)—no democracy would... Most of these [illegal immigrants], almost all of them, couldn't do anything...that would break the law. The minute they do that, they would be deported."</ref>

Referring to his views on [[Iran]], [[Leon Wieseltier]] described Zakaria in 2010 as a "consummate spokesman for the [[shibboleths]] of the [Obama] [[White House]] and for the smooth new worldliness, the at-the-highest-levels impatience with democracy and human rights as central objectives of our foreign policy, that now characterize advanced liberal thinking about America's role in the world."<ref>{{cite news |last=Wieseltier |first=Leon |date=25 June 2010 |title=The realism of seeking democracy in Iran |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/24/AR2010062404875.html |work=The Washington Post |access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref>

After the 9/11 attacks, in a ''Newsweek ''cover essay, "Why They Hate Us," Zakaria argued that Islamic extremism was not fundamentally rooted in Islam, nor could it be claimed a reaction to American foreign policy. He located the problem in the political-social-economic stagnation of Arab societies, which then bred an extreme, religious opposition. He portrayed Osama bin Laden as one in a long line of extremists who used religion to justify mass murder. Zakaria argued for an intergenerational effort to create more open and dynamic societies in Arab countries, and thereby helping Islam enter the modern world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2001/10/14/the-politics-of-rage-why-do-they-hate-us.html|title=The Politics of Rage: Why Do They Hate Us?|last=Zakaria|first=Fareed|date=2001-10-14|work=Newsweek|access-date=25 February 2012}}</ref>

Zakaria initially supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref name=world/> He said at the time, "The place is so dysfunctional ... any stirring of the pot is good. America's involvement in the region is for the good."<ref name=world/> He argued for a United Nations–sanctioned operation with a much larger force—approximately 400,000 troops—than was actually employed by the administration of President [[George W. Bush]]. However, he soon became a critic. In addition to objecting to the war plan, he frequently criticized the way the Bush administration was running the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]].<ref name="newsweeksurge" /> He argued against the disbanding of the army and bureaucracy yet supported the [[de-Baathification]] programs.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Fareed Zakaria |url=http://www.newsweek.com/giving-peace-real-chance-137835|title=Giving Peace a Real Chance |magazine=Newsweek |date=1 June 2003 |access-date=10 November 2014}}</ref> He continued to argue that a functioning democracy in Iraq would be a powerful new model for Arab politics but suggested that an honest accounting would have to say that the costs of the invasion had been much higher than the benefits. He opposed the Iraq [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge]] in March 2007, writing that it would work militarily but not politically, still leaving Iraq divided among its three communities. Instead, he advocated that Washington push hard for a political settlement between the Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurds, and begin a reduction in forces to only 60,000 troops.<ref name="newsweeksurge">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/03/04/the-surge-that-might-work.html|title=The Surge That Might Work|last=Zakaria|first=Fareed|date=3 April 2007|work=Newsweek|access-date=25 February 2012}}</ref> He later wrote that the surge "succeeded" militarily but that it did not produce a political compact and that Iraq remains divided along sectarian lines, undermining its unity, democracy, and legacy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/fareed_zakaria/2008/11/mccains_downfall_republican_fo.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 | work=The Washington Post | title=McCain's Downfall: Republican Foreign Policy | access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author=Fareed Zakaria|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/200858 |title=Zakaria: How to End in Iraq |magazine=Newsweek |date=6 June 2009 |access-date=2010-10-01}}</ref>

Zakaria supported the April 2017 [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|U.S. missile strike]] against a Syrian government–controlled airbase. Zakaria praised [[President Trump]]'s strike and said it was the moment "[he] became president of the United States."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/7/fareed-zakaria-donald-trump-became-president-last-/| work=The Washington Times | title=CNN's Fareed Zakaria: 'Donald Trump became president' last night | access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>

In March 2021, Zakaria criticized the size of the [[Military budget of the United States|U.S. military budget]], saying that "The United States’ [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] fighter jet program, bedeviled by cost overruns and technical problems, will ultimately cost taxpayers $1.7 trillion.

===Role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq===
In his 2006 book ''[[State of Denial]]'', journalist [[Bob Woodward]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described a 29 November 2001, meeting of Middle East analysts, including Zakaria, that was convened at the request of the then Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Paul D. Wolfowitz|Paul Wolfowitz]]. According to a story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on Woodward's book, the Wolfowitz meeting ultimately produced a report for [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] that supported the subsequent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Zakaria, however, later told ''The New York Times'' that he had briefly attended what he thought was "a brainstorming session".<ref>{{cite news|last=Bosman|first=Julie|title=Secret Iraq Meeting Included Journalists|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 October 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/business/media/09zakaria.html?ex=1318046400&en=ab43603ab31201e7&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss|access-date=2007-01-16}}</ref> He was not told that a report would be prepared for the President, and in fact, the report did not have his name on it. The ''Times'' issued a correction.<ref>Quote: "An article in Business Day on Oct. 9 about journalists who attended a secret meeting in November 2001 called by Paul D. Wolfowitz, then the deputy secretary of defense, referred incorrectly to the participation of Fareed Zakaria, the editor of ''Newsweek International'' and a ''Newsweek'' columnist. Mr. Zakaria was not told that the meeting would produce a report for the Bush administration, nor did his name appear on the report."</ref>

===Debate on the Park51 Islamic Center===
In 2010, in protest at the [[Anti-Defamation League]]'s opposition to the building of the [[Park51]] mosque and Islamic cultural center two blocks from the [[World Trade Center site]], Zakaria returned the Hubert H. Humphrey First Amendment Freedoms Prize awarded to him by the ADL in 2005. He declared that the ADL's opposition to the mosque meant that he could not "in good conscience keep [the award] anymore". In support of his decision, he stated that the larger issue in the controversy is freedom of religion in America, even while acknowledging that he is not a religious person. He also wrote that a "moderate, mainstream version of Islam" is essential to winning the war on terror, and that moves like the ADL's make it harder for such a moderate version of Islam to emerge and thrive.<ref name="returnaward1">{{Cite news
