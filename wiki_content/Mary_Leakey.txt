'''Mary Douglas Leakey''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (née '''Nicol''', 6 February 1913 – 9 December 1996) was a British [[paleoanthropologist]] who discovered the first fossilised ''[[Proconsul (mammal)|Proconsul]]'' skull, an extinct ape which is now believed to be ancestral to humans.  She also discovered the robust ''[[Zinjanthropus]]'' skull at [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]], eastern Africa. For much of her career she worked with her husband, [[Louis Leakey]], at Olduvai Gorge, where they uncovered fossils of ancient [[hominine]]s and the earliest [[hominins]], as well as the stone tools produced by the latter group. Mary Leakey developed a system for [[Taxonomy (general)|classifying]] the stone tools found at Olduvai.  She discovered the [[Laetoli#Hominin footprints|Laetoli footprints]], and at the Laetoli site she discovered hominin fossils that were more than 3.75 million years old.

During her career, Leakey discovered fifteen new [[species]] of animal. She also brought about the naming of a new [[genus]].

In 1972, after the death of her husband, Leakey became director of excavations at Olduvai.  She maintained the Leakey family tradition of palaeoanthropology by training her son, [[Richard Leakey|Richard]], in the field.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Mary Leakey was born on 6 February 1913, in [[London]], England to Erskine Edward Nicol and Cecilia Marion (Frere) Nicol. The Nicol family moved to numerous locations in thе [[United States]], [[Italy]], and [[Egypt]] where Erskine painted watercolors that he brought back and sold in England. Mary began to develop an enthusiasm for [[Egyptology]] during these travels.

On her mother's side, Mary was a 3rd great-granddaughter of antiquarian [[John Frere]]. The Frere family had been active [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] in the British colonial empire during the 19th century and established several communities for freed slaves. Three of these communities were still in existence when Leakey published her 1984 autobiography: Freretown, [[Kenya]]; Freretown, [[South Africa]]; and Freretown, [[India]].

The Nicols spent much of their time in southern France where young Mary became fluent in [[French language|French]]. In 1925, when Mary was 12, the Nicols stayed at the commune, [[Les Eyzies]], at a time when Elie Peyrony, a French archeologist and prehistorian, was excavating one of the caves there. Peyrony was not excavating scientifically during that early stage of archaeology and did not understand the significance of much of what he found. Mary received permission to go through the remnants of his dig and this was where her interests in [[prehistory]] and [[archaeology]] were sparked. She started a collection of points, scrapers, and blades from the dump and developed her first system of classification.<ref>Morell, Virginia, ''Ancestral Passions'', 1995, Chapter 4, "Louis and Mary."</ref>

The family then moved to [[Cabrerets]], a village of [[Lot (department)|Lot]], France. There she met Abbé Lemozi, the village priest, who befriended her and became her mentor for a time. The two toured [[Pech Merle]] cave to view the prehistoric paintings of bison and horses.<ref>''Disclosing the Past'' (1984), pp. 27–28.</ref>

===Education===
In the spring of 1926, when Mary was thirteen years old, her father died of cancer and Mary and her mother returned to London. Mary was placed in a local [[Catholic]] convent to be educated, and she later boasted of never passing an examination there.<ref name="OBIT" /> Although she spoke fluent French, Mary did not excel at French language studies, apparently because her teacher frowned upon her provincial accent. She was expelled for refusing to recite poetry, and was later expelled from a second convent school for causing an explosion in a chemistry laboratory.<ref>''Disclosing the Past'', p. 33.</ref> After the second expulsion, her mother hired two tutors, who were no more successful than the nuns. After the unsuccessful tutors, her mother hired a nanny.

Mary's particular interests centered on illustration and archaeology, but formal university admission was impossible with her academic record. Her mother contacted a professor at [[Oxford University]] about possible admission, and was encouraged not to apply, as it would be a waste of her time. Mary had no further contact with the university until it awarded her an honorary doctoral degree in 1951.

The small family moved to [[Kensington]], in West London, where, though unregistered, Mary attended lectures in archaeology and related subjects at the [[University College London|University College]] and at the [[London Museum]], where she studied under [[Mortimer Wheeler]].<ref>''Disclosing the Past'', pp. 34–26, 36–37.</ref>

Mary applied to work on a number of summer excavations. Wheeler was the first to accept her for a dig. It took place at [[St. Albans]] at the [[Rome|Roman]] site of [[Verulamium]]. Her next dig was at [[Hembury]], a [[Neolithic]] site, under [[Dorothy Liddell]], who trained her for four years until 1934. Her [[illustration]]s of tools for Liddell drew the attention of [[Gertrude Caton Thompson]], and, in late 1932, she entered the field as an illustrator for Caton Thompson's book ''The Desert Fayoum''.<ref>''Disclosing the Past'', pp. 37–39.</ref>

===Life===
[[File:Mary Douglas Nicol Leakey (1913-1996) and her husband Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey (1903-1972).jpg|thumb|Mary and Louis Leakey at [[Olduvai Gorge]]]]
Through Caton Thompson, an English archeologist, Mary met [[Louis Leakey]], who was in need of an illustrator for his book ''Adam's Ancestors'' (1934).  While she was doing that work they became romantically involved. Leakey was still married and his son Collin had just been born when they moved in with each other. They married after [[Frida Leakey]], divorced him in 1936.<ref name="ODNB" /> This ruined his career at [[Cambridge University]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Mary and Louis Leakey had three sons: Jonathan, born in 1940, [[Richard Leakey|Richard]] in 1944, and [[Philip Leakey|Philip]] in 1949. Their fourth child, a daughter, died as a baby.<ref name="ODNB" /> The three boys received much of their early childhood care at various anthropological sites and, whenever possible, the Leakeys excavated and explored as a family. The children accompanied them to various work sites, with dig becoming a family endeavour.<ref>{{cite book|title=Women in Human Evolution|date=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=17|last1=Hager|first1=Lori}}</ref>  The boys grew up with the same love of freedom that their parents had become accustomed to.  Mary would not even allow guests to shoo away the pet [[hyrax]]es that helped themselves to food and drink at the dinner table.  In her autobiography, she rarely mentioned her pregnancies or the difficulties she faced while raising children in Kenya. She smoked a lot, first cigarettes and then cigars, and usually dressed as though completing an excavation.

While her husband was alive, they published many joint findings. However, her contributions were often credited to her husband.<ref name="Hager" /> Louis Leakey died on 1 October 1972 of a heart attack. Mary Leakey continued with the family's archaeological work, becoming a respected figure in paleoanthropology of her own right. Her son, Richard Leakey, also decided to become a paleoanthropologist, and Mary helped him begin his career. Her two sons, Jonathan and Philip Leakey, pursued other interests.

===Death===
Mary Leakey died on 9 December 1996, in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, at the age of 83. Her family, who announced her death, did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.<ref name="NYT" />

==Research==

[[File:Plaque marking the discovery of Australopithecus in Tanzania.jpg|thumb|Plinth with plaque sited in Olduvai Gorge marking the spot where Mary Leakey discovered "Zinjanthropus", the first-found ''A. boisei'' in Africa.]]
Mary Leakey served her apprenticeship under Dorothy Liddell at [[Hembury]], 1930–34 (''see'' above). In 1934, she took part in a dig at [[Swanscombe]] where she discovered the largest elephant tooth known to Britain at that time.<ref>''Disclosing the Past'', pp. 47–48.</ref>

Throughout the 1930s-50s, Mary and Louis Leakey worked at [[Later Stone Age]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Iron Age]] archaeological sites in central Kenya, such as [[Hyrax Hill]] and [[Njoro River Cave]]. In October 1948, Mary discovered a ''[[Proconsul africanus]]'' skull on [[Rusinga Island]].<ref name="News" /><ref name="Cornwall" /> Mary Leakey also recorded and published the [[Kondoa Irangi Rock Paintings]] in central Tanzania.

The Leakeys' most famous research, however, was at [[Oldupai Gorge|Olduvai Gorge]] in the [[Serengeti]] plains of northern [[Tanzania]]. The site yielded many stone tools, from [[Oldowan]] choppers to multi-purpose [[hand axes]]. The earliest tools they dug up were likely made by ''[[Homo habilis]]'' and can be dated to over two million years ago.

On the morning of 17 July 1959, Louis felt ill at Olduvai and stayed at camp while Mary went out to the field. At some point she noticed a piece of bone that "seemed to be part of a skull" with a "[[hominid]]" look".<ref>Mary Leakey, ''My Search'', 75.</ref> After dusting the topsoil away, she found "two large teeth set in the curve of a jaw", and she drove back to camp exclaiming "I've got him!"<ref>Morell, 181.</ref> Active excavation began the following day and a partial cranium was unearthed within a few weeks, though it had to be reconstructed from fragments scattered in the [[scree]].<ref>Cela-Conde & Ayala, 158; Morell, 183–184.</ref> After examining the cranium, Louis Leakey concluded it was of a species ancestral to humans, the [[australopithecines]].<ref>Cela-Conde & Ayala, 158; Johanson, Edgar & Brill, 156</ref>
He eventually dubbed the find ''[[Zinjanthropus boisei]]'', "[[East Africa]] man"—''[[Zanj|Zinj]]'' is an ancient Arabic word for the East African coast. The name was later revised to ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'', and by some to ''[[Australopithecus boisei]]'';  a consensus on its classification is still in debate.

After her husband died in 1972, Mary Leakey continued their work at Olduvai and [[Laetoli]]. It was at the Laetoli site that she discovered hominin fossils that were more than 3.75 million years old.

From 1976 to 1981, Leakey and her staff uncovered the [[Laetoli#Hominid footprints|Laetoli hominin footprint]] trail which had been tracked through a layer of [[volcanic ash]] some 3.6 million years ago. The subsequent years were filled with research at Olduvai and Laetoli, follow-up work to discoveries, and preparing publications.

Throughout her career, Leakey discovered 15 new [[species]] of animals, and one new [[genus]]. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1979.<ref name="Members" />

==Legacy==
In April 2013, Leakey was honoured by [[Royal Mail]] in the UK, as one of six people selected as subjects for the "Great Britons" [[Great Britain commemorative stamps 2010–2019|commemorative postage stamp]] issue.<ref name="RMG" /> [[Google]] celebrated the 100th anniversary of Mary Leakey's birth with its [[Google doodle]] for 6 February 2013.<ref>[//www.google.com/doodles/mary-leakeys-100th-birthday "Mary Leakey's 100th Birthday"], [[Google]]; accessed 6 February 2013.</ref>

In the video game [[Civilization VI]], Leakey is a Great Scientist that players can recruit. Her unique ability grants extra science and tourism to artifacts.<ref>{{Citation|title=Scientists - Civilization 6 Wiki Guide - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/wikis/civilization-6/Scientists|language=en|access-date=2021-06-20}}</ref>
