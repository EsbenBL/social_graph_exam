The '''Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs''' ('''APNSA'''), commonly referred to as the '''National Security Advisor''' ('''NSA''')<ref name="TNSAaS:1">The National Security Advisor and Staff: p. 1.</ref>{{refn|Abbreviated '''NSA''', or sometimes '''APNSA''' or '''ANSA''' in order to avoid confusion with the abbreviation of the [[National Security Agency]].|group="Note"}} is a senior aide in the [[Executive Office of the President]], based at the [[West Wing]] of the [[White House]]. The National Security Advisor serves as the principal advisor to the [[President of the United States]] on all [[national security]] issues.  The National Security Advisor is appointed by the President and does not require [[Advice and consent|confirmation]] by the [[United States Senate]]. However, an appointment of a three or four-star General to the role requires Senate reconfirmation of military rank.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcmaster-will-need-senate-confirmation-to-serve-as-national-security-adviser/|title=McMaster will need Senate confirmation to serve as national security adviser|access-date=March 12, 2017|language=en|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301015417/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcmaster-will-need-senate-confirmation-to-serve-as-national-security-adviser/|archive-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>

The National Security Advisor participates in meetings of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) and usually chairs meetings of the Principals Committee of the NSC with the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] (those meetings not attended by the President). The NSA also sits on the [[Homeland Security Council]] (HSC).

The National Security Advisor is supported by NSC staff who produce classified research and briefings for the National Security Advisor to review and present, either to the National Security Council or directly to the President.

==Role==
The influence and role of the National Security Advisor varies from administration to administration and depends not only on the qualities of the person appointed to the position, but also on the style and management philosophy of the incumbent president.<ref name="TNSAaS:17-21">[[#TNSAaS|The National Security Advisor and Staff]]: pp. 17-21.</ref> Ideally, the National Security Advisor serves as an honest broker of policy options for the president in the field of national security, rather than as an advocate for his or her own policy agenda.<ref name="TNSAaS:10-14">[[#TNSAaS|The National Security Advisor and Staff]]: pp. 10-14.</ref>

The National Security Advisor is a staff position in the Executive Office of the President and does not have [[Staff and line|line]] or budget authority over either the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] or the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], unlike the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, who are Senate-confirmed officials with statutory authority over their departments.<ref>See {{UnitedStatesCode|22|2651}} for the Secretary of State and {{UnitedStatesCode|10|113}} for the Secretary of Defense.</ref> The National Security Advisor is able to offer daily advice (due to the proximity) to the president independently of the vested interests of the large bureaucracies and clientele of those departments.<ref name="TNSAaS:17-21" />

In times of crisis, the National Security Advisor is likely to operate from the [[White House Situation Room]] or the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]] (as on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]),<ref name="clarke18">{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Richard A.|author-link=Richard A. Clarke|title=Against All Enemies|publisher=Free Press|year=2004|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/againstallenemie00clar/page/18 18]|isbn=0-7432-6024-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/againstallenemie00clar/page/18}}</ref> updating the president on the latest events in a crisis situation.

==History==
[[File:President Bush meets with General Colin Powell, General Scowcroft, Secretary James Baker, Vice President Quayle... - NARA - 186429.tif|thumb|left|President [[George H. W. Bush]] meets in the [[Oval Office]] with his NSC about [[Operation Desert Shield]], 1991]]
The National Security Council was created at the start of the [[Cold War]] under the [[National Security Act of 1947]] to coordinate defense, foreign affairs, international economic policy, and intelligence; this was part of a large reorganization that saw the creation of the Department of Defense and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref name=george/><ref name=schmitz>{{cite book |last=Schmitz|first=David F.|title=Brent Scowcroft: Internationalism and Post-Vietnam War American Foreign Policy|year=2011 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|pages=2–3}}</ref> The Act did not create the position of the National Security Advisor per se, but it did create an executive secretary in charge of the staff. In 1949, the NSC became part of the Executive Office of the President.<ref name=george>{{cite book|last=George|first=Robert Z|title=The National Security Enterprise: Navigating the Labyrinth|year=2011 |publisher=Georgetown University Press|page=32|author2=Harvey Rishikof | author2-link = Harvey Rishikof }}</ref>

Robert Cutler was the first National Security Advisor in 1953, and held the job twice, both times during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]]. The system has remained largely unchanged since then, particularly since President John Kennedy, with powerful National Security Advisors and strong staff but a lower importance given to formal NSC meetings. This continuity persists despite the tendency of each new president to replace the advisor and senior NSC staff.<ref name=george/>

President [[Richard Nixon]]'s National Security Advisor, [[Henry Kissinger]], enhanced the importance of the role, controlling the flow of information to the president and meeting with him multiple times per day. Kissinger also holds the distinction of serving as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State at the same time from September 22, 1973, until November 3, 1975.<ref name=george/><ref name=schmitz/> He holds the record for longest term of service (2,478 days), and Michael Flynn holds the record for shortest term at just 24 days.

Brent Scowcroft held the job in two non-consecutive administrations: the [[Ford administration]] and the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|G.H.W. Bush administration]].
