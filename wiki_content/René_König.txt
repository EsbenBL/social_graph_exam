'''René König''' (5 July 1906 – 21 March 1992) was a German [[sociologist]]. He was very influential on West German sociology after 1949.

Born in [[Magdeburg]], he 1925 took up Philosophy, Psychology, Ethnology, and Islamic Studies at the Universities of Vienna and Berlin. He gained his doctorate (''Dr. phil.'') 1930 at the [[Berlin University]]. As an enemy of the Nazis, he could not obtain his post-doctoral degree (''Habilitation'') in the Reich, so he emigrated to Switzerland in 1937 and passed the examination at the University of [[Zürich]], 1938. By then, he was strongly influenced by [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Maurice Halbwachs]], and [[Marcel Mauss]]. 1949, he was called to the chair of [[Sociology]] at [[Cologne University]], where he built up what was to be known later as the "Cologne School" (''Kölner Schule'') and established the ''[[Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie]]''. He never left this university, in spite of several calls, and became Professor Emeritus in 1974, dying at [[Cologne]] 1992.

He never gave up cultural studies writing the first [[sociology of fashion]], but at the same time he was a German pioneer of empirical methods, as against the ideological biases of many contemporal colleagues. 

He played as well an important role in the [[International Sociological Association]]. He was the fifth president of ISA (1962-1966).<ref name="presidents">{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/about/presidents/ |title=ISA Presidents |publisher=International Sociological Association|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>

The René König Society (''René-König-Gesellschaft'') is publishing a complete edition of his writings.
