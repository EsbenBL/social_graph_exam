===Pre-history===
The history of core South Asia begins with evidence of human activity of ''[[Anatomically modern humans|Homo sapiens]],'' as long as 75,000 years ago, or with earlier hominids including ''[[Homo erectus]]'' from about 500,000 years ago.<ref>G. Bongard-Levin, ''A History of India'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1979) p. 11.</ref> The earliest prehistoric culture have roots in the mesolithic sites as evidenced by the rock paintings of [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] dating to a period of 30,000 BCE or older,{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Doniger|2010|p=66}}: "Much of what we now call Hinduism may have had roots in cultures that thrived in South Asia long before the creation of textual evidence that we can decipher with any confidence. Remarkable cave paintings have been preserved from Mesolithic sites dating from c. 30,000 BCE in [[Bhimbetka rock shelters|Bhimbetka]], near present-day Bhopal, in the Vindhya Mountains in the province of Madhya Pradesh."}} as well as neolithic times.{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=xvii}}: "Some practices of Hinduism must have originated in Neolithic times (c. 4000 BCE). The worship of certain plants and animals as sacred, for instance, could very likely have very great antiquity. The worship of goddesses, too, a part of Hinduism today, maybe a feature that originated in the Neolithic."}}

Increasing urbanisation of India between 800 and 400 BCE, and possibly the spread of urban diseases, contributed to the rise of ascetic movements and of new ideas which challenged the orthodox [[Brahmanism]].{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=81–82}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2020}} These ideas led to [[Sramana]] movements, of which Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of [[Jainism]], and [[Buddha]] (c. 563–483), founder of [[Buddhism]], were the most prominent icons.<ref name="World Religions">{{cite book |first=Jacob |last=Neusner |year=2009 |title=World Religions in America: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34vGv_HDGG8C&pg=PA183 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=978-0-664-23320-4 |access-date=26 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418085646/https://books.google.com/books?id=34vGv_HDGG8C&pg=PA183 |archive-date=18 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Greek army led by [[Alexander the Great]] stayed in the [[Hindu Kush]] region of South Asia for several years and then later moved into the Indus valley region. Later, the [[Maurya Empire]] extended over much of South Asia in the 3rd century BCE. Buddhism spread beyond south Asia, through northwest into Central Asia. The [[Bamiyan Buddhas]] of Afghanistan and the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of Aśoka]] suggest that the Buddhist monks spread Buddhism (Dharma) in eastern provinces of the [[Seleucid Empire]], and possibly even farther into Western Asia.{{Sfn| Gombrich|2006|p=135}}{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=103, 119}}<ref>{{cite book |first=Jason |last=Neelis |title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GB-JV2eOr2UC |year=2010 |publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=978-90-04-18159-5 |pages=102–106 |access-date=26 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126160511/https://books.google.com/books?id=GB-JV2eOr2UC |archive-date=26 November 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Theravada school spread south from India in the 3rd century BCE, to Sri Lanka, later to Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Guy |title=Lost Kingdoms: Hindu-Buddhist Sculpture of Early Southeast Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vO_-AgAAQBAJ |year=2014 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |isbn=978-1-58839-524-5 |pages=9–11, 14–15, 19–20 |access-date=26 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223141140/https://books.google.com/books?id=vO_-AgAAQBAJ |archive-date=23 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Buddhism, by the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, was prominent in the Himalayan region, Gandhara, Hindu Kush region and Bactria.<ref name="Neelis2010p249">{{cite book|first=Jason|last=Neelis|title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GB-JV2eOr2UC|year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-18159-5|pages=114–115, 144, 160–163, 170–176, 249–250|access-date=26 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126160511/https://books.google.com/books?id=GB-JV2eOr2UC|archive-date=26 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=deborahkh>Deborah Klimburg-Salter (1989), The Kingdom of Bamiyan: Buddhist art and culture of the Hindu Kush, Naples – Rome: Istituto Universitario Orientale & Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, {{ISBN|978-0-87773-765-0}} (Reprinted by Shambala)</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Barbara|last=Crossette|title=So Close to Heaven: The Vanishing Buddhist Kingdoms of the Himalayas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iCQAAAAMAAJ |year=1996|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-679-74363-7|pages=84–85}}</ref>

Revolts against the Delhi Sultanate sprang up in many parts of South Asia during the 14th century. After the death of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Bengal Sultanate came to power in 1352 CE, as the Delhi Sultanate began disintegrating. The Bengal Sultanate remained in power through the early 16th century. It was reconquered by the armies of the Mughal Empire. The state religion of the Bengal Sultanate was Islam, and the region under its rule, a region that ultimately emerged as the modern nation of Bangladesh, saw a growth of a syncretic form of Islam.<ref name="Lewis2011">{{cite book |first=David |last=Lewis |author-link=David Lewis (academic) |title=Bangladesh: Politics, Economy and Civil Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lH40gT7xvYC&pg=PA44 |date=31 October 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=44 |isbn=978-1-139-50257-3 |quote=In 1346 ... what became known as the Bengal Sultanate began and continued for almost two centuries.}}</ref><ref name="Hussain2003">{{cite book |author=Syed Ejaz Hussain |date=2003 |title=The Bengal Sultanate: Politics, Economy and Coins, A.D. 1205–1576 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFyd95ECLwkC |publisher=Manohar |isbn=978-81-7304-482-3}}</ref> In the Deccan region, the Hindu kingdom [[Vijayanagara Empire]] came to power in 1336 and remained in power through the 16th century, after which it too was reconquered and absorbed into the Mughal Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kulke and Rothermund|first=Hermann and Dietmar |title= A History of India|url= https://archive.org/details/historyindia00kulk|url-access= limited|orig-year=2004|year= 2004|publisher= Routledge (4th edition)|isbn= 978-0-415-32919-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyindia00kulk/page/n199 187]–188}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Nilakanta Sastri|first= K.

The [[modern history]] period of South Asia, that is 16th-century onwards, witnessed the start of the Central Asian dynasty named the Mughals, with Turkish-Mongol roots and Sunni Islam theology.

After the death of Aurangzeb and the collapse of the Mughal Empire, which marks the beginning of modern India, in the early 18th century, it provided opportunities for the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]], [[Mysore Kingdom|Mysoreans]] and [[Nawabs of Bengal]] to exercise control over large regions of the Indian subcontinent.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of State and Religion in India|first1=Ian|last1=Copland|first2=Ian|last2=Mabbett|first3= Asim|last3= Roy|first4=Kate|last4=Brittlebank|first5=Adam|last5=Bowles|page=161|display-authors=3|publisher=Routledge|year=2012}}</ref><ref>''History of Mysore Under Hyder Ali and Tippoo Sultan'' by Joseph Michaud p. 143</ref>

Maritime trading between South Asia and European merchants began after the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama returned to Europe. British, French, Portuguese colonial interests struck treaties with these rulers and established their trading ports. In northwest South Asia, a large region was consolidated into the Sikh Empire by [[Ranjit Singh]].<ref>{{cite book |author=J. S. Grewal |author-link=J. S.

===Contemporary era===
In 1905, the [[British Raj|Government of India]] initiated the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition]] of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], a decision which was eventually reversed after Indian opposition. However, during the [[partition of India]], Bengal was partitioned into [[East Bengal]] (Pakistan) and [[West Bengal]] (India). East Bengal became the [[Bangladesh|People's Republic of Bangladesh]] after the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite book|first=Debjani|last=Sengupta|title=The Partition of Bengal: Fragile Borders and New Identities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAO-DAAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-67387-4|pages=16–19}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Bashabi|last=Fraser|title=Bengal Partition Stories: An Unclosed Chapter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW30rV_UAskC |year=2008 |publisher=Anthem Press |pages=7–10 |isbn=978-1-84331-299-4}}</ref>

According to Saul Cohen, early colonial era strategists treated South Asia with East Asia, but in reality, the South Asia region excluding Afghanistan is a distinct [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] region separated from other nearby geostrategic realms, one that is geographically diverse.<ref>Saul Bernard Cohen, ''Geopolitics of the world system'', pages 304–305, Rowman & Littlefield, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8476-9907-2}}</ref> The region is home to a variety of geographical features, such as [[glacier]]s, [[rainforest]]s, [[valley]]s, [[desert]]s, and [[grassland]]s that are typical of much larger continents. It is surrounded by three water bodies{{snd}}the [[Bay of Bengal]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Arabian Sea]]{{snd}}and has acutely varied climate zones. The tip of the Indian Peninsula had the highest quality pearls.<ref>Xinru, Liu, ''"The Silk Road in World History"'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 40.</ref>

===Indian plate===
{{main|Indian plate}}

Most of this region is resting on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], separated from the rest of the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The Indian Plate includes most of South Asia, forming a land mass which extends from the [[Himalayas]] into a portion of the basin under the [[Indian Ocean]], including parts of [[Southwest China|South China]] and Eastern [[Indonesia]], as well as [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] and [[Karakoram]] ranges,<ref>Sinvhal, ''Understanding Earthquake Disasters'', page 52, Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-07-014456-9}}</ref><ref>Harsh K.

The [[Indian subcontinent]] formerly formed part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], before rifting away during the [[Cretaceous]] period and colliding with the [[Eurasian Plate]] about 50–55 million years ago and giving birth to the [[Himalayan range]] and the [[Tibetan plateau]]. It is the [[peninsula]]r region south of the [[Himalaya]]s and [[Kuen Lun]] mountain ranges and east of the [[Indus River]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]], extending southward into the Indian Ocean between the [[Arabian Sea]] (to the southwest) and the [[Bay of Bengal]] (to the southeast).

The climate of this vast region varies considerably from area to area from tropical monsoon in the south to temperate in the north. The variety is influenced by not only the altitude but also by factors such as proximity to the seacoast and the seasonal impact of the [[monsoon]]s. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]s also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.

As the [[Himalayas]] block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For the most part, the climate of the region is called the [[Monsoon]] climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of [[jute]], [[tea]], [[rice]], and various vegetables in this region.

South Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:<ref name=olive1>John E. Olive, ''The Encyclopedia of World Climatology'', page 115-117, Springer, 2005, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-3264-6}}</ref>
* The northern Indian edge and northern Pakistani uplands have a dry subtropical [[continental climate]]
* The far south of India and southwest Sri Lanka have an [[equatorial climate]]
* Most of the peninsula has a tropical climate with variations:
** Hot [[Subtropics|subtropical]] climate in northwest India
** Cool winter hot [[tropical climate]] in Bangladesh
** Tropical [[semi-arid climate]] in the center
* The Himalayas and most of the [[Hindu Kush]] have an [[Alpine climate]]

Maximum relative humidity of over 80% has been recorded in [[Khasi and Jaintia Hills]] and Sri Lanka, while the area adjustment to Pakistan and western India records lower than 20%–30%.<ref name=olive1/> Climate of South Asia is largely characterized by [[monsoon]]s. South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall.<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 83, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-540-42403-1}}</ref> Two monsoon systems exist in the region:<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 76, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-540-42403-1}}</ref>
* The summer monsoon: Wind blows from the southwest to most parts of the region. It accounts for 70%–90% of the annual precipitation.
* The winter monsoon: Wind blows from the northeast. Dominant in Sri Lanka and Maldives.

The warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid June). In the summer the low pressures are centered over the [[Indus-Gangetic Plain]] and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are the second coolest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June, the jetstreams vanish above the [[Tibetan Plateau]], low pressure over the [[Indus Valley]] deepens and the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.<ref name=olive1/>

[[Climate change in South Asia]] is causing a range of challenges including [[sea level rise]], cyclonic activity, and changes in [[ambient temperature]] and precipitation patterns.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kreft|first1=Sönke|url=https://germanwatch.org/en/download/16411.pdf|title=Global Climate Risk Index 2017|last2=David Eckstein|first2=David|last3=Melchior|first3=Inga|date=November 2016|publisher=Germanwatch e.V.|isbn=978-3-943704-49-5|location=Bonn|access-date=10 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925181000/https://germanwatch.org/en/download/16411.pdf|archive-date=25 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{main|Languages of South Asia}}
[[File:South Asian Language Families.png|thumb|right|Ethno-linguistic distribution map of South Asia]]
There are numerous languages in South Asia. The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan use the Arabic alphabet and Persian [[Nastaʿlīq script|Nastaliq]]. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) also mandated only the Nastaliq script, but after that adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. Non-Muslims of South Asia, and some Muslims in India, on the other hand, use their traditional ancient heritage scripts such as those derived from [[Brahmi script]] for Indo-European languages and non-Brahmi scripts for [[Dravidian languages]] and others.<ref name=kachru122>{{cite book|first1=Braj B.|last1=Kachru|first2=Yamuna|last2=Kachru|author3=S.

One of the key challenges in assessing the quality of education in South Asia is the vast range of contextual difference across the region, complicating any attempt to compare between countries.<ref name=SZ13>Suzana Brinkmann, [https://www.unicef.org/rosa/media/6991/file/Improving%20Education%20Quality%20in%20South%20Asia%20(I)_30Aug_019_Web.pdf.pdf Improving Education Quality in South Asia] (I), page 13, United Nations Children's Fund, Regional Office for South Asia, Nepal, 2018</ref> In 2018, 11.3 million children at the primary level and 20.6 million children at the lower secondary level were out-of-school in South Asia, while millions of children completed primary education without mastering the foundational skills of basic numeracy and literacy.<ref name=ESAFS>[https://www.unicef.org/rosa/what-we-do/education#:~:text=Education%20is%20a%20basic%20human,are%20out%2Dof%2Dschool.

According to UNESCO, 241 million children between six and fourteen years or 81 percent of the total were not learning in Southern and Central Asia in 2017. Only sub-Saharan Africa had a higher rate of children not learning. Two-thirds of these children were in school, sitting in classrooms. Only 19 percent of children attending primary and lower secondary schools attaining a minimum proficiency level in reading and mathematics.<ref name=MoreT>[http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs46-more-than-half-children-not-learning-en-2017.pdf ''More than One-Half of Children and Adolescents are not learning worldwide''], Fact Sheet No.46, UNESCO Institute for Statistics September 2017</ref><ref name=SZ3>Suzana Brinkmann, [https://www.unicef.org/rosa/media/6991/file/Improving%20Education%20Quality%20in%20South%20Asia%20(I)_30Aug_019_Web.pdf.pdf Improving Education Quality in South Asia] (I), page 3, United Nations Children's Fund, Regional Office for South Asia, Nepal, 2018</ref> According to a citizen-led assessment, only 48% in Indian public schools and 46% of children in Pakistan public schools could read a class two level text by the time they reached class five.<ref>[http://aserpakistan.org/report ASER Pakistan] (2015).

ASER Centre</ref><ref name=SZ3/> This poor quality of education in turn has contributed to the some of the highest drop-out rates in the world. While over half of the students complete secondary school with acquiring requisite skills.<ref name=SZ3/>

In South Asia, classrooms are teacher-centred and rote-based, while children are often subjected to corporal punishment and discrimination.<ref name=ESAFS/> Different South Asian countries have different education structures. While by 2018 India and Pakistan has two of the most developed and increasingly decentralised education systems, Bangladesh still had a highly centralised system, and Nepal is in a state of transition from a centralized to a decentralized system.<ref name=SZ13/> In most South Asian countries children's education is theoretically free; the exceptions being the Maldives, where there is no constitutionally guaranteed free education, as well as Bhutan and Nepal where fees are charged by primary schools. But parents are still faced with unmanageable secondary financial demands, including private tuition to make up for the inadequacies of the education system.<ref name=Oxfam4>[https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/120598/pi-girls%27-education-south-asia-192305-en.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Girls’ Education in South Asia], page 4, Education and Gender Equality Series, Programme Insights, Oxfam GB. February 2006</ref>

The larger and poorer countries in the region, like India and Bangladesh, struggle financially to get sufficient resources to sustain an education system required for their vast populations, with an added challenge of getting large numbers of out-of-school children enrolled into schools.<ref name=SZ13/> Their capacity to deliver inclusive and equitable quality education is limited by low levels of public finance for education,<ref name=ESAFS/> while the smaller emerging middle-income countries like Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan have been able to achieve universal primary school completion, and are in a better position to focus on quality of education.<ref name=SZ13/>

Children's education in the region is also adversely affected by natural and human-made crises including natural hazards, political instability, rising extremism and civil strife that makes it difficult to deliver educational services.<ref name=ESAFS/> Afghanistan and India are among the top ten countries with the highest number of reported disasters due to natural hazards and conflict. The precarious security situation in Afghanistan is a big barrier in rolling out education programmes on a national scale.<ref name=SZ13/>

According to UNICEF, girls face incredible hurdles to pursue their education in the region,<ref name=ESAFS/> while UNESCO estimated in 2005 that 24 million girls of primary-school age in the region were not receiving any formal education.<ref>[https://en.unesco.org/gem-report/report/2006/literacy-life Global Monitoring Report 2006: Literacy for Life], UNESCO, Paris</ref><ref>[https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/120598/pi-girls%27-education-south-asia-192305-en.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Girls’ Education in South Asia], page 1, Education and Gender Equality Series, Programme Insights, Oxfam GB. February 2006</ref> Between 1900 and 2005, most of the countries in the region had shown progress in girls' education with Sri Lanka and the Maldives significantly ahead of the others, while the gender gap in education has widened in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

With about 21 million students in 700 universities and 40 thousand colleges India had the one of the largest higher education systems in the world in 2011, accounting for 86 percent of all higher-level students in South Asia. Bangladesh (two million) and Pakistan (1.8 million) stood at distant second and third positions in the region. In Nepal (390 thousand) and Sri Lanka (230 thousand) the numbers were much smaller. Bhutan with only one university and Maldives with none hardly had between them about 7000 students in higher education in 2011. The gross enrolment ratio in 2011 ranged from about 10 percent in Pakistan and Afghanistan to above 20 percent in India, much below the global average of 31 percent.<ref name=Tilak>Jandhyala B.G.

The [[World Bank]] estimates that [[India]] is one of the highest ranking countries in the world for the number of children suffering from [[malnutrition]]. The prevalence of underweight children in India is among the highest in the world and is nearly double that of [[Sub Saharan Africa]] with dire consequences for mobility, mortality, productivity, and economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/0,,contentMDK:20916955~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:223547,00.html|title= World Bank Report|access-date= 2009-03-13|publisher= The World Bank|year= 2009|quote= World Bank Report on Malnutrition in India|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218015506/http://www.worldbank.org.in/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/INDIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20195738~menuPK:295591~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:295584,00.html|archive-date= 18 December 2008|url-status= live}}</ref>

According to the World Bank, 70% of the South Asian population and about 75% of South Asia's poor live in rural areas and most rely on agriculture for their livelihood<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/EXTSAREGTOPAGRI/0,,contentMDK:20750711~menuPK:452772~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:452766,00.html|title=Agriculture in South Asia|publisher=World Bank|access-date=21 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706154611/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/EXTSAREGTOPAGRI/0,,contentMDK:20750711~menuPK:452772~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:452766,00.html|archive-date=6 July 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> according to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation. In 2015, approximately 281 million people in the region were malnourished. The report says that Nepal reached both the WFS target as well as MDG and is moving towards bringing down the number of undernourished people to less than 5% of the population.<ref name="fao.org"/> Bangladesh reached the MDG target with the National Food Policy framework{{snd}}with only 16.5% of the population undernourished. In India, the malnourished comprise just over 15 percent of the population. While the number of malnourished people in the neighborhood has shown a decline over the last 25 years, the number of under-nourished in Pakistan displays an upward trend. There were 28.7 million hungry in Pakistan in the 1990s{{snd}}a number that has steadily increased to 41.3 million in 2015 with 22% of the population malnourished. Approximately 194.6 million people are undernourished in India, which accounts for the highest number of people suffering from hunger in any single country.<ref name="fao.org"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1184959|title=India home to world's largest number of hungry people: report|newspaper=Dawn|date=29 May 2015|access-date=4 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604142045/http://www.dawn.com/news/1184959|archive-date=4 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The 2006 report stated, "the low status of women in South Asian countries and their lack of nutritional knowledge are important determinants of high prevalence of underweight children in the region". Corruption and the lack of initiative on the part of the government has been one of the major problems associated with nutrition in India. Illiteracy in villages has been found to be one of the major issues that need more government attention. The report mentioned that although there has been a reduction in malnutrition due to the [[Green Revolution]] in South Asia, there is concern that South Asia has "inadequate feeding and caring practices for young children".<ref name="southasiahunger">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6046718.stm|title='Hunger critical' in South Asia|work=BBC News|date=2006-10-13|access-date=2010-01-04|first=Geeta|last=Pandey|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112084920/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6046718.stm|archive-date=12 January 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Nepal]] was the last Hindu state in world before [[Republic Day (Nepal)|becoming a secular democratic republic]] in 2008. The country has been ranked among world's poorest in terms of GDP per capita but has made considerable progress in development indicators outpacing many other South Asian states.

[[Bhutan]] is a Buddhist state with a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The country has been ranked as the least corrupt and peaceful with most economic freedom in the region in 2016. [[Myanmar]]'s politics is dominated by a military [[Military junta|Junta]], which has sidelined the democratic forces led by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].
