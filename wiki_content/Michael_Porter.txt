'''Michael Eugene Porter'''  (born May 23, 1947)<ref>date & year of birth, full name according to LCNAF [[Cataloging in Publication|CIP]] data</ref> is an American academic known for his theories on economics, business strategy, and social causes. He is the [[Financial endowment#Endowed professorships|Bishop William Lawrence University Professor]] at [[Harvard Business School]], and he was one of the founders of the consulting firm [[Monitor Deloitte|The Monitor Group]] (now part of [[Deloitte]]) and FSG, a social impact consultancy. He is credited for creating [[Porter's five forces analysis]], which is instrumental in business strategy development today.

==Early life==
Michael Porter is a baby and Georgia Tech graduate who had gone on to a career as an army officer. Michael Eugene Porter received a BSE with high honors in aerospace and [[mechanical engineering]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1969, where he graduated first in his class and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] and [[Tau Beta Pi]]. He received an MBA with high distinction in 1971 from [[Harvard Business School]], where he was a George F. Baker Scholar, and a PhD in business economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1973.

Porter said in an interview that he first became interested in competition through sports. He was on the NCAA championship golf squad at Princeton and also played football, baseball and basketball growing up.<ref name="LOS2010">{{cite book

Porter credits Harvard professor Roland "Chris" Christensen with inspiring him and encouraging him to speak up during class, hand-writing Porter a note that began: "Mr. Porter, you have a lot to contribute in class and I hope you will." Porter reached the top of the class by the second year at Harvard Business School.<ref name="LOS2010"/>

At Harvard, Porter took classes in [[industrial organization]] economics, which attempts to model the effect of competitive forces on industries and their profitability. This study inspired the [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for analyzing industries.<ref name="LOS2010"/>

==Career==
{{npov section|date=November 2017}}
Michael Porter is the author of 20 books and numerous articles including ''Competitive Strategy'', ''Competitive Advantage'', ''Competitive Advantage of Nations'', and ''On Competition''. A six-time winner of the McKinsey Award for the best ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article of the year, Professor Porter is the most cited author in business and economics.<ref name="revistas.unifacs.br">{{cite journal|url=https://revistas.unifacs.br/index.php/rgb/article/view/199|title=The False Expectations of Michael Porter's Strategic Management Framework |first=Omar|last=Aktouf|date=January 24, 2008|journal=Gestão & Planejamento – G&P|volume=1|issue=11|access-date=January 27, 2019|via=revistas.unifacs.br}}</ref>

Porter stated in a 2010 interview: "What I've come to see as probably my greatest gift is the ability to take an extraordinarily complex, integrated, multidimensional problem and get arms around it conceptually in a way that helps, that informs and empowers practitioners to actually do things."<ref name="LOS2010"/>

===Competition among nations===
Porter wrote "The Competitive Advantage of Nations" in 1990. The book is based on studies of ten nations and argues that a key to national wealth and advantage was the productivity of firms and workers collectively, and that the national and regional environment supports that productivity. He proposed the "diamond" framework, a mutually-reinforcing system of four factors that determine national advantage: factor conditions; demand conditions; related or supporting industries; and firm strategy, structure and rivalry. Information, incentives, and infrastructure were also key to that productivity.<ref name="Porter1990">{{cite book

During April 2014, Porter discussed how the United States ranks relative to other countries on a comprehensive scorecard called "The Social Progress Index", an effort which he co-authored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2014/04/20/michael-porter-on-gps-is-the-u-s-1/|title=Michael Porter on GPS: Is the U.S. #1?|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref> This scorecard rated the U.S. on a comprehensive set of metrics; overall, the U.S. placed 16th.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.socialprogress.org/|title=2018 Social Progress Index|website=2018 Social Progress Index|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref>

===Healthcare===
Porter has devoted considerable attention to understanding and addressing the pressing problems in health care delivery in the United States and other countries. His book, ''Redefining Health Care'' (written with Elizabeth Teisberg), develops a new strategic framework for transforming the value delivered by the health care system, with implications for providers, health plans, employers, and government, among other actors. The book received the James A. Hamilton award of the American College of Healthcare Executives in 2007 for book of the year. His ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' research article, "A Strategy for Health Care Reform{{snd}}Toward a Value-Based System" (July 2009), lays out a health reform strategy for the U.S. His work on health care is being extended to address the problems of health care delivery in developing countries, in collaboration with [[Dr. Jim Yong Kim]], [[Sachin H. Jain]], and others at the [[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Harvard School of Public Health]].

===Consulting===
In addition to his research, writing, and teaching, Porter serves as an advisor to business, government, and the [[social sector]]. He has served as strategy advisor to numerous leading U.S. and international companies, including [[Caterpillar Inc. | Caterpillar]], [[Procter & Gamble]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works |publisher=Harvard Business Review Press |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJVJ1HI}}</ref> [[Scotts Miracle-Gro Company | Scotts Miracle-Gro]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Taiwan Semiconductor]]. Professor Porter once served on two public boards of directors, those of [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]] and [[Parametric Technology Corporation]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} He also plays an active role in U.S. [[economic policy]], working with the [[Executive Branch of the United States | Executive Branch]] and with [[United States Congress | Congress]], and has led national economic-strategy programs in numerous{{quantify|date=June 2018}} countries. {{As of |2009}} he was working with the presidents of [[Rwanda]] and [[South Korea]].

==Criticisms==
Porter has been criticized by some academics for inconsistent logical argument in his assertions.<ref>Sharp, Byron; Dawes, John (1996), "Is Differentiation Optional?  A Critique of Porter's Generic Strategy Typology," in ''Management, Marketing and the Competitive Process'', Peter Earl, Ed. London: Edward Elgar.{{ISBN?}}</ref> Critics have also labeled Porter's conclusions as lacking in empirical support and as justified with selective case studies. They have also claimed that Porter fails to credit original creators of his postulates originating from pure microeconomic theory.<ref name="revistas.unifacs.br"/><ref>Speed, Richard J.
