'''John Law''' (born 16 May 1946),<ref name=Congress>{{cite web |title= Law, John, 1946- |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n91117383.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 13 February 2015 |quote= data sheet (b. 5/16/46) }}</ref> is a sociologist and [[science and technology studies]] scholar, currently on the Faculty of Social Sciences at the [[Open University]] and key proponent of [[Actor-network theory]]. Actor-network theory, sometimes abbreviated to ANT, is a social science approach for describing and explaining social, organisational, scientific and technological structures, processes and events. It assumes that all the components of such structures (whether these are human or otherwise) form a network of relations that can be mapped and described in the same terms or vocabulary.

Developed by two leading French [[Science and technology studies|STS]] scholars, [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], Law himself, and others, ANT may alternatively be described as a 'material-semiotic' method. ANT strives to map relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and 'semiotic' (between concepts), for instance, the interactions in a bank involve both people and their ideas, and computers. Together these form a single network.

Professor John Law was one of the directors of the [[Economic and Social Research Council|ESRC]] funded [[Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change]].
