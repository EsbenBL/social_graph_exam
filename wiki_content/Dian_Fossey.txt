'''Dian Fossey'''  ({{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|æ|n}}, January 16, 1932 – {{c.|December 26, 1985}})<!--full dates in infobox, per MOS--> was an American [[primatologist]] and [[Conservationist movement|conservationist]] known for undertaking an extensive study of [[mountain gorilla]] groups from 1966 until her 1985 murder.<ref name="history">{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=World-renowned primatologist Dian Fossey is found murdered in Rwanda|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/primatologist-dian-fossey-found-murdered-in-rwanda|access-date=July 21, 2020|website=HISTORY|language=en|archive-date=July 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721135846/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/primatologist-dian-fossey-found-murdered-in-rwanda|url-status=live}}</ref> She studied them daily in the mountain forests of [[Rwanda]], initially encouraged to work there by [[paleoanthropologist]] [[Louis Leakey]]. ''Gorillas in the Mist'', a book published two years before her death, is Fossey's account of her scientific study of the [[gorilla]]s at [[Karisoke Research Center]] and prior career.

Fossey was a leading primatologist, and a member of the [[The Trimates|"Trimates"]], a group of female scientists recruited by Leakey to study great apes in their natural environments, along with [[Jane Goodall]] who studies [[chimpanzee]]s, and [[Birutė Galdikas]], who studies [[orangutan]]s.<ref name="NYT 5.1.81">{{Cite news|last=Robertson|first=Nan|date=May 1981|title=Three Who Have Chosen a Life in the Wild|periodical=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/style/three-who-have-chosen-a-life-in-the-wild.html|department=B|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822173139/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/style/three-who-have-chosen-a-life-in-the-wild.html|archive-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name="nytimes 7.15.90">{{cite news |last=Willis|first=Delta|date=July 15, 1990|title=Some Primates Weren't To Be Trusted|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/books/some-primates-weren-t-to-be-trusted.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201153104/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/books/some-primates-weren-t-to-be-trusted.html|archive-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>

Fossey spent 20 years in Rwanda, where she supported conservation efforts, strongly opposed poaching and tourism in wildlife habitats, and made more people acknowledge the sapience of gorillas. Following the killing of a gorilla and subsequent tensions, she was murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in [[Rwanda]] in December 1985. Although Fossey's American research assistant was convicted ''in absentia'', there is no consensus as to who killed her.

Her research and conservation work helped reduce the downward population trend in mountain gorillas.

==Early life==
Fossey was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], the daughter of Kathryn "Kitty" ([[née]] Kidd), a fashion model, and George E. Fossey III, an insurance agent.<ref name=WareBraukman/> Her parents divorced when she was six.<ref name=innominate>{{cite web|url=http://www.innominatesociety.com/Articles/Karisoke%20Revisited.htm|title=Karisoke Revisited – A Study of Dian Fossey|publisher=innominatesociety.com|access-date=December 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223133256/https://www.innominatesociety.com/Articles/Karisoke%20Revisited.htm|archive-date=December 23, 2019}}</ref> Her mother remarried the following year, to businessman Richard Price. Her father tried to keep in contact, but her mother discouraged it, and all contact was subsequently lost.<ref name=webster>{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/fossey.html|title=Dian Fossey|publisher=Webster.edu|access-date=December 14, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205143418/http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/fossey.html|archive-date=December 5, 2009}}</ref> Fossey's stepfather, Richard Price, never treated her as his own child.

===Education and medical career===
Fossey attended [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]]. Following the guidance of her stepfather, she enrolled in a business course at the [[College of Marin]] in San Francisco. However, spending her summer on a ranch in [[Montana]] at age 19 rekindled her love of animals, and she enrolled in a pre-[[veterinary]] course in biology at the [[University of California, Davis]]. In defiance of her stepfather's wishes for her to attend a business school, Fossey decided to spend her professional life working with animals. Consequently, Fossey's parents failed to give her any substantial amount of financial support throughout her adult life.<ref name="farley" /> She supported herself by working as a clerk at a [[White Front]] department store, doing other clerking and laboratory work, and laboring as a [[machinist]] in a factory.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Although Fossey had always been an exemplary student, she had difficulties with basic sciences including [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], and failed her second year of the program. She transferred to [[San Jose State University|San Jose State College]], where she became a member of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] [[sorority]], to study [[occupational therapy]], receiving her [[bachelor's degree]] in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage.kappaalphatheta.org/page/notablethetas|title=Notable Thetas – Heritage – Kappa Alpha Theta|access-date=March 29, 2016|archive-date=October 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019001306/http://heritage.kappaalphatheta.org/page/notablethetas|url-status=live}}</ref> Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in [[occupational therapy]].

==The Leakeys and the Congo==
===Journey to Africa===

Fossey turned down an offer to join the Henrys on an African tour due to lack of finances,<ref name=webster/> but in 1963 she borrowed $8,000 (one year's salary), took out her life savings<ref name=McPherson>{{cite web|last1=McPherson|first1=Angie|title=Zoologist Dian Fossey: A storied life with gorillas|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140116-dian-fossey-google-doodle-national-geographic-gorillas-birthday/|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic|access-date=September 3, 2014|date=January 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105191834/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/1/140116-dian-fossey-google-doodle-national-geographic-gorillas-birthday/|archive-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref> and went on a seven-week visit to Africa.<ref name=innominate/> In September 1963, she arrived in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].<ref name=GFDFL/> While there, she met actor [[William Holden]], owner of [[Treetops Hotel]],<ref name=innominate/> who introduced her to her safari guide, John Alexander.<ref name=innominate/> Alexander became her guide for the next seven weeks through Kenya, [[Tanzania]], [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Democratic Republic of Congo]], and [[Rhodesia]]. Alexander's route included visits to [[Tsavo]], Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of [[Manyara]], famous for attracting giant flocks of [[flamingo]]s; and the [[Ngorongoro Crater]], well known for its abundant wildlife.<ref name=GFDFL/> The final two sites for her visit were [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] (the archeological site of [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]]); and [[Mount Mikeno|Mt. Mikeno]] in Congo, where, in 1959, American zoologist [[George Schaller]] had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for [[hominid]] [[fossil]]s. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of English primatologist [[Jane Goodall]] and the importance of long-term research on the [[great apes]].<ref name=GFDFL/>

Although Fossey had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys,<ref name=GFDFL/> by October 16, she was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in [[Uganda]], the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers [[Joan Root|Joan]] and [[Alan Root]]. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.<ref name=GFDFL/> After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans. She published three articles in ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' newspaper, detailing her visit to Africa.<ref name=innominate/><ref name=GFDFL/>

===Research in the Congo===
[[File:Virunga Mountain Gorilla 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Gorilla mother with infant in [[Virunga National Park]] in the Congo]]

When Leakey made an appearance in Louisville while on a nationwide lecture tour, Fossey took the color supplements that had appeared about her African trip in ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' to show to Leakey, who remembered her and her interest in mountain gorillas. Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas in the same manner as [[Jane Goodall]] had with chimpanzees in Tanzania.<ref name="farley"/> Leakey lined up funding for Fossey to research mountain gorillas, and Fossey left her job to relocate to Africa.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives|year=1998|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|pages=294–296|editor1=Kenneth T. Jackson |editor2=Karen Markoe |editor3=Arnold Markoe }}</ref>

After studying [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and auditing a class on [[primatology]] during the eight months it took to get her visa and funding, Fossey arrived in Nairobi in December 1966. With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped [[Land Rover]] which she named "Lily". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe Stream Research Centre]] to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.<ref name=GFDFL/> Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the [[Virunga Mountains]], Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.<ref name="Montgomery136">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=136}}</ref> Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to "Lily" and make the two-hour drive to the village of Kikumba to restock.<ref name=GFDFL/>

Fossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant.<ref name="Montgomery136"/> She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children.<ref name="farley"/> Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual "noseprints" for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.<ref name=GFDFL/>

Fossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the [[Belgian Congo]] until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General [[Joseph-Désiré Mobutu]], by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the [[Congo Crisis]]. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the [[Kivu]] Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at [[Rumangabo]] for two weeks. Fossey eventually escaped through bribery to Walter Baumgärtel's Travellers Rest Hotel in [[Kisoro]], where her escort was arrested by the Ugandan military.<ref name=GFDFL/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gorillafund.org/dian_fossey/ |title=About Dian Fossey – Info about the Life of Dian Fossey |publisher=Gorillafund.org |date=November 16, 2013 |access-date=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612232428/http://gorillafund.org/dian_fossey/ |archive-date=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>
Advised by the Ugandan authorities not to return to Congo, after meeting Leakey in Nairobi, Fossey agreed with him against [[Us embassy|US Embassy]] advice to restart her study on the [[Rwanda]]n side of the [[Virunga Mountains|Virungas]].<ref name=GFDFL/> In Rwanda, Fossey had met local American expatriate [[Rosamond Carr]], who introduced her to [[Belgium|Belgian]] local Alyette DeMunck; DeMunck had a local's knowledge of Rwanda and offered to find Fossey a suitable site for study.<ref name=GFDFL/>

==Conservation work in Rwanda==
[[File:Visoke.jpg|upright=1.15|thumbnail|right|Fossey established her research camp in the foothills of [[Mount Bisoke]].]]

On September 24 1967, Fossey founded the [[Karisoke Research Center]], a remote [[rainforest]] camp nestled in [[Ruhengeri]] province in the saddle of two volcanoes. For the research center's name, Fossey used "Kari" for the first four letters of [[Mount Karisimbi]] that overlooked her camp from the south, and "soke" for the last four letters of [[Mount Bisoke]], the slopes of which rose to the north, directly behind camp.<ref name=GFDFL/><ref name="pbs">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/the-gorilla-king-more-on-dian-fossey-and-her-research/737/|title=More on Dian Fossey and Her Research|date=June 11, 2008|website=Nature|publisher=PBS|access-date=August 24, 2020|archive-date=June 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200629150044/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/the-gorilla-king-more-on-dian-fossey-and-her-research/737/|url-status=live}}</ref> Established {{convert|3000|m|ft}} up Mount Bisoke, the defined study area covered {{convert|25|km2|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/2|title=Dian Fossey text|magazine=National Geographic|access-date=December 14, 2009|archive-date=March 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320052351/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/2|url-status=live}}</ref> She became known by locals as Nyirmachabelli, or Nyiramacibiri, roughly translated as "The woman who lives alone on the mountain."<ref name="Montgomery130">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=130}}</ref>

Unlike the gorillas from the Congo side of the Virungas, the Karisoke area gorillas had never been partially habituated by Schaller's study; they knew humans only as [[poachers]], and it took longer for Fossey to be able to study the Karisoke gorillas at a close distance.<ref name="Montgomery138">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=138}}</ref> Fossey attempted to habituate the gorillas by copying their actions. Over time the gorillas became accustomed to Fossey. As she explained to the BBC in 1984: "I'm an inhibited persona and I felt that the gorillas were somewhat inhibited as well, so I imitated their natural, normal behaviour like feeding, munching on celery stalks or scratching myself"
<ref name="bbc"/>

Fossey made discoveries about gorillas including how females transfer from group to group over the decades, gorilla [[Animal communication#Auditory|vocalization]], [[Gorilla#Social structure|hierarchies and social relationships]] among groups, rare infanticide, gorilla diet, and how gorillas [[nutrient recycling|recycle nutrients]].<ref name="Montgomery149">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=149}}</ref> Fossey's research was funded by the Wilkie Foundation and the Leakey Home, with primary funding from the [[National Geographic Society]].<ref name="Mowat200">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=200–1}}</ref>

In 1970, she appeared on the cover of [[National Geographic Magazine]], which brought tremendous attention to her work.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|last=Hogenboom|first=Melissa|date=December 26, 2015|title=The Woman Who Gave Her Life to Save the Gorillas|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151226-the-woman-who-gave-her-life-to-save-the-gorillas|work=BBC|access-date=August 1, 2020|archive-date=June 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627032228/http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151226-the-woman-who-gave-her-life-to-save-the-gorillas|url-status=live}}</ref>

Fossey was often hostile to Africans who entered into the protected area, even shooting roaming cattle.<ref name="bbc"/>

By 1980, Fossey, who had obtained her PhD at [[Cambridge University]] in the UK, was recognized as the world's leading authority on the physiology and behavior of mountain gorillas, defining gorillas as being "dignified, highly social, gentle giants, with individual personalities, and strong family relationships."<ref name=webster/> Fossey lectured as professor at Cornell University in 1981–83. Her bestselling book ''Gorillas in the Mist'' was praised by [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], the Dutch ethologist and ornithologist who won the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. Her book remains the best-selling book about gorillas.<ref name="farley"/>

Many research students left after not being able to cope with the cold, dark, and extremely muddy conditions around Karisoke on the slopes of the Virunga Volcanoes, where paths usually had to be cut through six-foot-tall grass with a machete.<ref name="Montgomery131">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|pp=131–2}}</ref>

===Opposition to poaching===
While [[hunting]] had been illegal in the national park of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] in Rwanda since the 1920s, the law was rarely enforced by park conservators, who were often bribed by [[poachers]] and paid a salary less than Fossey's own African staff.<ref name="farley"/> On three occasions, Fossey wrote that she witnessed the aftermath of the capture of infant gorillas at the behest of the park conservators for zoos; since gorillas will fight to the death to protect their young, the kidnappings would often result in up to 10 adult gorillas' deaths.<ref name="farley"/> Through the [[Digit Fund]], Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers' traps in the Karisoke study area. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol, consisting of four African staffers, destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.<ref name="Mowat223">{{Harvnb|Mowat|p=223}}</ref> The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period.<ref name="Mowat223"/> In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's [[elephant]]s for [[ivory]] and killed more than a dozen gorillas.<ref name="Mowat223"/>

Fossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences.<ref name="Mowat174"/>

In 1978<!-- In the book, National Geographic The Covers (ISBN 978-1-4262-1388-5), on page 103 it states that Dian Fossey tended to Coco and Pucker Puss in the spring of 1969. -->, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the [[Cologne Zoological Garden|zoo]] in [[Cologne, Germany]]. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.<ref name="Mowat74">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=74–8}}</ref> The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to a semblance of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.<ref name="farley"/> She viewed the holding of animals in "prison" ([[zoo]]s) for the entertainment of people as unethical.<ref name="fossey">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref>

While gorillas from rival groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla, Digit, was killed in 1978. Later that year, the [[Silverback#Group life|silverback]] of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.<ref name="Mowat187">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=187–190}}</ref> Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but, as a result of Uncle Bert's intervention, Kweli was not captured; however, three-year-old Kweli died, slowly and painfully, of [[gangrene]], from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.<ref name="fossey"/><ref name="Mowat187"/>

According to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[African Wildlife Foundation]], Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claimed not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the [[Mount Sabyinyo]] area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation.<ref name="farley"/> The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and anti-[[bushmeat]] hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and, as she put it, "to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life." Fossey described the two philosophies as her own "active conservation" or the international conservation groups' "theoretical conservation."<ref name="Mowat174"/>

===Killing of Digit and escalating tensions===

Sometime during the day on [[New Year's Eve]] 1977, Fossey's favorite gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking [[antelope]] traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defense and managed to kill one of the poachers' dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fossey|first=Dian|date=April 1981|title=The Imperiled Mountain Gorilla: A Grim Struggle for Survival|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/1981/04/mountain-gorillas-virunga-peril-dian-fossey/|work=National Geographic Magazine|access-date=July 30, 2020|archive-date=June 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622000403/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/1981/04/mountain-gorillas-virunga-peril-dian-fossey/|url-status=live}}</ref> Digit was decapitated, and his hands cut off for ashtrays.

Fossey subsequently created the [[Digit Fund]] (now the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International in the US)<ref>This organization is unaffiliated with the Gorilla Organization in the UK, which uses Dian's name although it no longer funded her work after Digit's death.</ref> to raise money for anti-poaching patrols.<ref name="fossey"/> In addition, a consortium of international gorilla funds arose to accept donations in light of Digit's death and increased attention on poaching.<ref name="Mowat187"/> Fossey mostly opposed the efforts of the international organizations, which she felt inefficiently directed their funds towards more equipment for Rwandan park officials, some of whom were alleged to have ordered some of the gorilla poachings in the first place.<ref name="Mowat187"/>

The deaths of some of her most studied gorillas caused Fossey to devote more of her attention to preventing poaching and less on scientific publishing and research.<ref name="Mowat187"/> Fossey became more intense in protecting the gorillas and began to employ more direct tactics: she and her staff cut animal traps almost as soon as they were set; frightened, captured and humiliated the poachers; held their cattle for ransom; burnt their hunting camps and even burnt the mats from their houses.<ref name=innominate/>{{Better source needed|reason=A better source than an unattributed article by the "Innominate Society" is needed if you want to accuse someone of kidnapping, torture, and vandalism...|date=September 2017}}

===Aftermath===
After Fossey's death, her entire staff was arrested. This included Rwandan Emmanuel Rwelekana, a tracker who had been fired from his job after he allegedly tried to kill Fossey with a machete, according to the government's account of McGuire's trial. All were later released, except Rwelekana, who was later found dead in prison, allegedly having hanged himself.<ref name="farley"/><ref name="auto"/>

Rwandan courts later tried and convicted Wayne McGuire ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for her murder. The alleged motive was that McGuire murdered Fossey in order to steal the manuscript of the sequel to her 1983 book, ''Gorillas in the Mist''. At the trial, investigators said McGuire was not happy with his own research and wanted to use "any dishonest means possible" to complete his work. McGuire had returned to the United States in July 1987,<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-19/news/mn-3576_1_dian-fossey|title=American Found Guilty in Absentia of Rwanda Killing of Gorilla Expert Fossey|last=Kraft|first=Scott|date=December 19, 1986|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=April 15, 2016|archive-date=April 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428130659/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-19/news/mn-3576_1_dian-fossey|url-status=live}}</ref> and because no [[extradition]] treaty exists between the U.S. and Rwanda, McGuire did not return to Rwanda.<ref name="farley"/> His penalty was death by shooting.<ref name="nyt"/>

Following his return to the U.S., McGuire gave a brief statement at a news conference in [[Century City, Los Angeles]], saying Fossey had been his "friend and mentor", calling her death "tragic" and the charges "outrageous".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-30/local/me-14231_1_dian-fossey |title=Suspect Denies Killing Famous Naturalist; Conspiracy Hinted |author=Eric Malnic |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 30, 1986 |access-date=January 16, 2014 |archive-date=January 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116222018/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-30/local/me-14231_1_dian-fossey |url-status=live }}</ref> Thereafter, McGuire was largely absent from public notice until 2005, when news broke that he had been accepted for a job with the Health and Human Services division of the [[Government of Nebraska|State of Nebraska]].

Several subsequent books, including [[Farley Mowat]]'s biography of Fossey, ''[[Woman in the Mists]]'' (New York, NY: Warner Books, 1987), have suggested alternative theories regarding her murder, including intimations that she may have been killed by financial interests linked to tourism or illicit trade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} It has been alleged that Fossey had potentially damning evidence of gold-smugglers, hence the ransacked cabin.<ref name="bbc"/>

A will purporting to be Fossey's bequeathed all of her estate (including the proceeds from the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'') to the Digit Fund to underwrite anti-poaching patrols. Fossey did not mention her family in the will, which was unsigned.  Her mother, Hazel Fossey Price, successfully challenged the will.<ref name="farley"/> New York State Supreme Court Justice Swartwood threw out the will and awarded the estate to her mother, including about $4.9 million in royalties from a recent book and upcoming movie, stating that the document "was simply a draft of her purported will and not a will at all."

==Personal life and views==
[[File:Darwin College - geograph.org.uk - 1333608.jpg|thumb|Fossey attended [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].]]
During her African safari, Fossey met Alexie Forrester, the brother of a [[Rhodesian]] she had been dating in Louisville; Fossey and Forrester later became engaged. In her later years, Fossey became involved with ''[[National Geographic]]'' photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]] after a year of working together at Karisoke, with Campbell promising to leave his wife.<ref name=innominate/> Eventually the pair grew apart through her dedication to the gorillas and Karisoke, along with his need to work further afield and on his marriage. In 1970, studying for her Ph.D. at [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], [[University of Cambridge]], she discovered she was pregnant and had an abortion, later commenting that "you can't be a cover girl for ''National Geographic'' magazine and be pregnant." She graduated with a Doctor of [[Philosophy]] in [[Zoology]] in 1976.<ref name=innominate/>{{failed verification|date=August 2017}} Fossey had other relationships throughout the years and always had a love for children.<ref name="nytimes 7.15.90"/> Since Fossey would rescue any abused or abandoned animal she saw in Africa or near Karisoke, she acquired a [[menagerie]] in the camp, including a monkey who lived in her cabin, Kima, and a dog, Cindy. Fossey held Christmas parties every year for her researchers, staffers, and their families, and she developed a genuine friendship with [[Jane Goodall]].<ref name="Mowat269">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=269}}</ref>

===Health===
Fossey had been plagued by lung problems from an early age and, later in her life, suffered from advanced [[emphysema]] brought on by years of heavy [[health effects of tobacco|cigarette smoking]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Gorillas' Protector on the Hunt for Poachers |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |date=October 24, 1985 |page=B8 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VBEjAAAAIBAJ&pg=1038%2C1557499 |quote=A tall Californian, Fossey has emphysema.

===Opposition to tourism===
Fossey strongly opposed [[wildlife tourism]], as gorillas are susceptible to [[Anthroponotic disease|human anthroponotic diseases]] like [[influenza]] from which they have limited immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior.<ref name="farley"/> Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned that Jane Goodall, was inappropriately changing her study of chimpanzees' behavior.<ref name="Mowat174">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=174–5}}</ref>

Today, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillafund.org/travel|title=Visit Gorillas – The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International|access-date=March 29, 2016|archive-date=March 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326064641/http://gorillafund.org/travel|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Legacy==
After her death, Fossey's Digit Fund in the US was renamed the [[Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dian Fossey's legacy|url=http://gorillafund.org|work=Biography|publisher=The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International|access-date=January 16, 2014|archive-date=May 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517061340/https://gorillafund.org/|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Karisoke Research Center]] is operated by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, and continues the daily gorilla monitoring and protection that she started.

Fossey is generally credited with reversing the downward trend in the mountain gorilla population. Due to poaching, gorilla populations declined from 450 in 1960 to just 250 in 1981. However, Fossey's "war on poaching" saw the final confirmed killing of a gorilla in 1983. By the late 1980s, the population had risen to 280. It continues to rise.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|last=Brooke|first=James|date=May 22, 1987|title=Kinigi Journal; Rwanda Gorillas Are Again King of the Mountain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/22/world/kinigi-journal-rwanda-gorillas-are-again-king-of-the-mountain.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 24, 2020|archive-date=February 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221175240/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/22/world/kinigi-journal-rwanda-gorillas-are-again-king-of-the-mountain.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Fossey's research, and the following publicity, spawned "gorilla tourism".<ref name="pbs"/>

===In media and books===
[[Universal Studios]] bought the film rights to ''Gorillas in the Mist'' from Fossey in 1985, and [[Warner Bros. Studios]] bought the rights to "the Dark Romance of Dian Fossey", a work by [[Harold_Hayes|Harold T. P. Hayes]], despite its having been severely criticized by [[Rosamond Carr]]. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'', starring [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Bryan Brown]], and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]]. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by [[Bryan Brown]]) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.<ref>{{cite news|author=Variety Staff|date=December 31, 1987|title=Gorillas in the Mist – The Story of Dian Fossey|url=https://variety.com/1987/film/reviews/gorillas-in-the-mist-the-story-of-dian-fossey-1200427577/|work=Variety|access-date=July 30, 2020|archive-date=August 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200825211659/https://variety.com/1987/film/reviews/gorillas-in-the-mist-the-story-of-dian-fossey-1200427577/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rule|first=Sheila|date=September 18, 1988|title=Luring Apes From Mist To Movies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/18/movies/luring-apes-from-mist-to-movies.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 25, 2020|archive-date=November 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113060910/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/18/movies/luring-apes-from-mist-to-movies.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2017, ''Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist'', a three-hour series, aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]].

In ''A Forest in the Clouds: My Year Among the Mountain Gorillas in the Remote Enclave of Dian Fossey'' (Pegasus Books, 2018) John Fowler describes Fossey's remote mountain gorilla camp, Karisoke Research Center, a few years prior to her murder, telling the story of the unraveling of Fossey's Rwandan facility as pressures mount in an effort to extricate Fossey from her domain. Fowler represents Fossey as a chain-smoking, hard-drinking woman who bullied her staff and students in her efforts to hold onto to her reputation as scientist and savior of the mountain gorillas.<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T4nIuwEACAAJ|title = A Forest in the Clouds|isbn = 9781643131412|last1 = Fowler|first1 = John|date = June 11, 2019|access-date = December 10, 2020|archive-date = January 24, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210124204258/https://books.google.com/books?id=T4nIuwEACAAJ|url-status = live}}</ref>
