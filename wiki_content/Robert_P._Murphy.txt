===Erroneous inflation predictions===
Murphy has been criticized by economists [[Brad DeLong]] and [[Paul Krugman]] for predicting that the [[quantitative easing]] practiced by the [[Federal Reserve]] in the late 2000s would create double-digit inflation and economic ruin—predictions that have not come to fruition yet.<ref name="Reason">{{Cite web |url=https://reason.com/archives/2014/11/30/whatever-happened-to-inflation/singlepage |title=Reason |access-date=2016-01-05 |archive-date=2015-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906072910/http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/30/whatever-happened-to-inflation/singlepage |url-status=live }}</ref>  He stated that the policies of [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] and President Obama would lead to double-digit inflation with high unemployment and could facilitate the abandonment of the US Dollar by the end of the Obama Presidency.<ref name="Killing the Currency">Robert P. Murphy, [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/killing-the-currency/ "Killing the Currency"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630080146/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/killing-the-currency/ |date=2013-06-30 }}, [[The American Conservative]], December 10, 2009.</ref> 

In a series of articles on his personal website, Murphy states that he agreed to a bet that there would be a year/year increase in the seasonally adjusted [[United States Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index]] of over 10% by 2013, and notes that he lost the bet.<ref name="consultingbyrpm.com">Murphy, Robert P.

In 2013 Murphy challenged Krugman to a debate and unnamed supporters of Murphy promised to donate $100,000 to a charity if Krugman would debate Murphy on economic policy issues.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carney|first=John|title=Will Paul Krugman be Shamed Into Debating an Austrian Economics Wunderkind?|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/39832879|access-date=19 April 2013|newspaper=CNBC website|date=October 25, 2010|archive-date=24 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624002310/http://www.cnbc.com/id/39832879|url-status=live}}</ref> A promotional website was established for the challenge. Krugman called the proposed debate a "public circus" and stated "Why should I dignify that totally-wrong doctrine — that doctrine that's gotten everything wrong — by giving them a platform?"<ref>Lehrer, Brian (June 4, 2012).
