==Toponymy==
{{See also|Names of European cities in different languages (B)}}

===Etymology===
The most common theory of the origin of the name ''Brussels'' is that it derives from the [[Old Dutch]] {{lang|odt|Bruocsella}}, {{lang|odt|Broekzele}} or {{lang|odt|Broeksel}}, meaning "marsh" ({{lang|odt|bruoc}} / {{lang|odt|broek}}) and "home" ({{lang|odt|sella}} / {{lang|odt|zele}} / {{lang|odt|sel}}) or "home in the marsh".<ref>[[Geert van Istendael]] ''Arm Brussel'', uitgeverij Atlas, {{ISBN|90-450-0853-X}}</ref> [[Saint Vindicianus]], the Bishop of [[Cambrai]], made the first recorded reference to the place {{lang|odt|Brosella}} in 695,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jean Baptiste D'Hane |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4aAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA405 |title=Nouvelles archives historiques, philosophiques, et littéraires |last2=François Huet |last3=P.A. Lenz |last4=H.G. Moke |publisher=C. Annoot- Braeckman |year=1837 |volume=1 |location=Gent |page=405 |language=fr}}</ref> when it was still a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. The names of all the municipalities in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] are also of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] origin, except for [[Evere]], which is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]].

===Pronunciation===
In [[French language|French]], {{lang|fr|Bruxelles}} is pronounced {{IPA-fr|bʁysɛl||Fr-Bruxelles.ogg|}} (the ''x'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|s}}, like in [[English language|English]], and the final ''s'' is silent) and in Dutch, {{lang|nl|Brussel}} is pronounced {{IPA-nl|ˈbrʏsəl||Nl-Brussel.ogg}}. Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as {{lang|fr|Bruxellois}} (pronounced {{IPA-fr|bʁysɛlwa||Fr-bruxellois.ogg}}) and in Dutch as {{lang|nl|Brusselaars}} (pronounced {{IPA-nl|ˈbrʏsəlaːrs||Sound file=Nl-Brusselaars.ogg}}). In the [[Brabantian dialect]] of Brussels (known as [[Brusselian dialect|Brusselian]], and also sometimes referred to as Marols or Marollien),<ref name="Jeanine Treffers-Daller 1994">Jeanine Treffers-Daller, ''Mixing Two Languages: French-Dutch Contact in a Comparative Perspective'' (Walter de Gruyter, 1994), 25.</ref> they are called ''Brusseleers'' or ''Brusseleirs''.<ref name="evans" />

Originally, the written ''x'' noted the group {{IPAc-en|k|s}}. In the [[Belgian French]] pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the ''k'' eventually disappeared and ''z'' became ''s'', as reflected in the current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling]], whereas in the more conservative [[French orthography|French form]], the spelling remained.<ref>[[Jean d'Osta]], ''Dictionnaire historique des faubourgs de Bruxelles'', édition Le Livre {{ISBN|978-2-930135-10-6}}.</ref> The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|k|s}} in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels usage. In [[France]], the pronunciations {{IPA-fr|bʁyksɛl||Fr-Bruxelles.oga}} and {{IPA-fr|bʁyksɛlwa|}} (for {{lang|fr|bruxellois}}) are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.<ref name="Lerond, 1980 pp. 477">Alain Lerond, ''Dictionnaire de la prononciation'' (1980), Larousse, pp. 477.</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:Charles de France fondateur de Bruxelles 976 MOD.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] founded what would become Brussels, {{circa|979}}.]]
The history of Brussels is closely linked to that of [[Western Europe]]. Traces of human settlement go back to the [[Stone Age]], with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of [[megalith]]s, [[dolmen]]s and [[Menhir|standing stones]] (Plattesteen in the city centre and [[Tomberg metro station|Tomberg]] in [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]], for example). During [[late antiquity]], the region was home to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered on the current site of [[Tour & Taxis]], north-west of the [[Pentagon (Brussels)|Pentagon]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=6 August 2015 |title=Bruxelles: des vestiges romains retrouvés sur le site de Tour et Taxis |language=fr-FR |work=RTBF Info |url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/bruxelles/detail_decouverte-majeure-a-bruxelles-des-vestiges-romains-retrouves-sur-le-site-de-tour-et-taxis?id=9048235 |access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Les Romains de Tour & Taxis — Patrimoine – Erfgoed |url=http://patrimoine.brussels/news/les-romains-de-tour-et-taxis |access-date=28 April 2017 |website=patrimoine.brussels |language=fr}}</ref> Following the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it was incorporated into the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]].

The origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in [[Gaugericus|Saint Gaugericus]]' construction of a chapel on [[Saint Gaugericus Island|an island]] in the river [[Zenne|Senne]] around 580.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brussels History |url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Brussels-History.html |access-date=5 July 2009 |publisher=City-data.com}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=Cited source does not reference scholarly literature. Possibly local legend, not fact|date=September 2020}} The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lotharingia|Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia]] transferred the relics of Saint [[Gudula]] from [[Moorsel]] (located in today's province of [[East Flanders]]) to Saint Gaugericus' chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.

===Middle Ages===
[[Lambert I of Leuven]], [[County of Leuven|Count of Leuven]], gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne, on an important trade route between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], and [[Cologne]], Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (Treurenberg, [[Coudenberg]] and [[Sablon (Brussels)|Sablon/Zavel]] areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on what is now the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] (1225), replacing an older [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became [[Duke of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In the early 13th century, the [[Fortifications of Brussels#First_walls|first walls of Brussels]] were built,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zo ontstond Brussel |trans-title=This is how Brussels originated |url=http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120140134/http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |archive-date=20 November 2007 |publisher=Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie [Commission of the Flemish Community in Brussels] |language=nl}}</ref> and after this, the city grew significantly. To let the city expand, [[Fortifications of Brussels#Second_walls|a second set of walls]] was erected between 1356 and 1383. Traces of these walls can still be seen, although the [[Small Ring, Brussels|Small Ring]], a series of roadways bounding the historical city centre, follows their former course.

===Early modern===
[[File:Brussel.1610.a.jpg|thumb|left|View of Brussels, {{circa|1610}}|alt=]]
In the 15th century, the marriage between heiress [[Margaret III of Flanders]] and [[Philip the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], produced a new Duke of Brabant of the [[Valois Dynasty|House of Valois]] (namely [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine]], their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]] perished in the [[Battle of Nancy]]. Through the marriage of his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the [[Low Countries]] fell under [[Habsburg]] sovereignty. Brabant was integrated into this composite state, and Brussels flourished as the Princely Capital of the prosperous [[Burgundian Netherlands]], also known as the [[Seventeen Provinces]]. After the death of Mary in 1482, her son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] succeeded as Duke of Burgundy and Brabant.

Philip died in 1506, and he was succeeded by his son [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] who then also became [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] (crowned in the [[St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]]) and even Holy Roman Emperor at the death of his grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519. Charles was now the ruler of a [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] "on which the sun never sets" with Brussels serving as his main capital.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 April 2017 |title=How Brussels became the capital of Europe 500 years ago |url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels/42112/how-brussels-became-the-capital-of-europe-500-years-ago/ |access-date=13 August 2019 |website=The Brussels Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Jr |first=Everett Jenkins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSYkCQAAQBAJ&q=Charles+V+28+years+in+the+netherlands&pg=PA36 |title=The Muslim Diaspora (Volume 2, 1500-1799): A Comprehensive Chronology of the Spread of Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas |date=7 May 2015 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476608891 |access-date=13 August 2019 |via=Google Books}}</ref> It was in [[Coudenberg|the Palace complex at Coudenberg]] that Charles V was declared of age in 1515, and it was there in 1555 that he abdicated all of his possessions and passed the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] to [[Philip II of Spain]]. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731.

[[File:Grand- Place BXL1695 -01.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Place]] after [[Bombardment of Brussels|the 1695 bombardment]] by the French army]]
In the 16th and 17th centuries, Brussels was a centre for the [[lace]] industry. In addition, [[Brussels tapestry]] hung on the walls of castles throughout Europe.<ref>Souchal, Geneviève (ed.), ''Masterpieces of Tapestry from the Fourteenth to the Sixteenth Century: An Exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art'', p. 108, 1974, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Galeries nationales du Grand Palais (France), {{ISBN|0870990861}}, 9780870990861, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e-fZHUt8issC&pg=PA108 google books]</ref><ref>Campbell, ed. ''Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence'', exhibition catalogue, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] 2002.</ref> In 1695, during the [[Nine Years' War]], King [[Louis XIV]] of France sent troops to [[bombardment of Brussels|bombard Brussels with artillery]]. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The [[Grand Place]] was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings—a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of [[Pentagon (Brussels)|the city centre]], effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed its appearance and left numerous traces still visible today.{{sfn|Culot|Hennaut|Demanet|Mierop|1992}}

Following the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Brussels [[Siege of Brussels|was captured]] by France in 1746, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but was handed back to Austria three years later. It remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France, and the city became the capital of the [[Dyle (department)|department of the Dyle]]. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of [[Napoleon]] on the [[Battle of Waterloo|battlefield of Waterloo]], located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Southern Netherlands joined the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], under [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of Orange]]. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.

===Late modern===
[[File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville in Brussels.JPG|thumb|left|''Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Gustaf Wappers]], 1834]]
In 1830, the [[Belgian revolution]] began in Brussels, after a performance of [[Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at the [[La Monnaie|Royal Theatre of La Monnaie]].{{sfn|Slatin|1979|p=53–54}}  The city became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], with Brussels as its administrative centre. On 21 July 1831, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], the first [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]], ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.

Following independence, Brussels underwent many more changes. It became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies launched by the ''[[Société Générale de Belgique]]''. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the opening of the [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]] in 1832 brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The [[Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)|Free University of Brussels]] was established in 1834 and [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels|Saint-Louis University]] in 1858. In 1835, the [[History of rail transport in Belgium|first passenger railway]] built outside England linked the municipality of [[Molenbeek-Saint-Jean]] with [[Mechelen]].{{sfn|Wolmar|2010|p=20}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Histoire en quelques mots — Français |url=http://www.molenbeek.irisnet.be/fr/je-visite/histoire/Histoire%20en%20quelques%20mots |access-date=2017-01-12 |website=molenbeek.irisnet.be}}</ref>

[[File:Bruxelles, Place Royale, -Brussels, Belgium--LCCN2001697909.jpg|thumb|The [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale/Koningsplein]] in the late 19th century]]
During the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The [[Zenne|Senne]] had become a serious [[health hazard]], and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of the [[mayor of the City of Brussels|city's then-mayor]], [[Jules Anspach]], its entire course through the urban area was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered over]]. This allowed [[urban renewal]] and the construction of modern buildings of ''[[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Haussmann]]-esque'' style along grand [[Central Boulevards of Brussels|central boulevards]], characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] (1873), the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883) and [[Saint Mary's Royal Church]] (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]. The [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|International Exposition of 1897]] contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the {{ill|Palace of the Colonies|fr|Palais des Colonies}} (today's [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]]), in the suburb of [[Tervuren]], was connected to the capital by the construction of an [[Avenue de Tervueren|11-km long grand alley]].

Brussels became one of the major European cities for the development of the [[Art Nouveau in Brussels|Art Nouveau]] style in the 1890s and early 1900s. The architects [[Victor Horta]], [[Paul Hankar]], and [[Henry van de Velde]] became particularly famous for their designs, many of which survive today.<ref name=":6" />

===20th century===
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|left|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels was the fifth world physics conference.]]
During the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the [[Solvay Conference]] on Physics and on Chemistry, and three world fairs: the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels International Exposition of 1935]] and the 1958 Brussels World's Fair ([[Expo '58]]). During [[World War I]], Brussels was an [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied]] city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During [[World War II]], it was again [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied by German forces]], and spared major damage, before it was liberated by the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] on 3 September 1944. The [[Brussels Airport]], in the suburb of [[Zaventem]], dates from the occupation.
[[File:Scenes of jubilation as British troops liberate Brussels, 4 September 1944. BU508.jpg|thumb|British tanks [[Liberation of Belgium|arrive in Brussels]] on 4 September 1944, ending the German occupation]]

After the war, Brussels underwent extensive modernisation. The construction of the [[North–South connection]], linking the main railway stations in the city, was completed in 1952, while the first [[Brussels premetro|''premetro'']] (underground tram) service was launched in 1969,<ref name="1960s">{{Cite web |year=2013 |title=STIB – La STIB de 1960 à 1969 |trans-title=STIB – STIB from 1960 to 1969 |url=http://www.stib.be/1960-1969.html?l=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221053137/http://www.stib.be/1960-1969.html?l=fr |archive-date=2013-12-21 |access-date=2013-09-15 |publisher=STIB |language=fr}}</ref> and the first line of the [[Brussels Metro|metro]] was opened in 1976.<ref name="1970s">{{Cite web |year=2013 |title=STIB – Historique de la STIB de 1970 à 1979 |trans-title=STIB – History of STIB from 1970 to 1979 |url=http://www.stib.be/1970-1979.html?l=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021155415/http://www.stib.be/1970-1979.html?l=fr |archive-date=2013-10-21 |access-date=2013-09-15 |publisher=STIB |language=fr}}</ref> Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the ''de facto'' capital of what would become the [[European Union]], and many modern offices were built. Development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and numerous architectural landmarks were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, giving name to the process of [[Brusselization|Brusselisation]].

[[2016 Brussels bombings|On 22 March 2016]], three coordinated [[nail bomb]]ings were detonated by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] in Brussels—two at [[Brussels Airport]] in [[Zaventem]] and one at [[Maalbeek/Maelbeek metro station]]—resulting in 32 victims and three [[Suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] killed, and 330 people were injured. It was the deadliest act of [[terrorism]] in Belgium.

==Geography==

===Location and topography===
[[File:Brussels by Sentinel-2, 2020-05-30.jpg|thumb|Satellite picture of the Greater Brussels area]]
{{Further|Geography of Belgium}}
Brussels lies in the north-central part of Belgium, about {{convert|110|km}} from the Belgian coast and about {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} from Belgium's southern tip. It is located in the heartland of the Brabantian Plateau, about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Antwerp]] ([[Flanders]]), and {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Charleroi]] ([[Wallonia]]). Its average [[elevation]] is {{convert|57|m}} above [[sea level]], varying from a low point in the valley of the almost completely covered [[Zenne|Senne]], which cuts the Brussels-Capital Region from east to west, up to high points in the [[Sonian Forest]], on its southeastern side. In addition to the Senne, tributary streams such as the [[Maalbeek]] and the [[Woluwe]], to the east of the region, account for significant elevation differences. [[Central Boulevards of Brussels|Brussels' central boulevards]] are {{convert|15|m}} above sea level.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brussels in figures 1 |url=https://visit.brussels/en/article/brussels-in-figures |access-date=3 September 2017 |website=visit.brussels |language=en}}</ref> Contrary to popular belief, the highest point (at {{convert|127.5 |m}}) is not near the {{lang|fr|Place de l'Altitude Cent|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hoogte Honderdplein|italic=no}} in [[Forest, Belgium|Forest]], but at the {{lang|fr|Drève des Deux Montages|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Tweebergendreef|italic=no}} in the Sonian Forest.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-05-22 |title=Le point le plus haut de la région Bruxelloise se trouve en forêt de Soignes |url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/detail_le-point-le-plus-haut-de-la-region-bruxelloise-se-trouve-en-foret-de-soignes?id=10227678 |access-date=2021-02-10 |website=RTBF Info |language=fr}}</ref>

===Climate===
Brussels experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') with warm summers and cool winters.<ref name="Brussels,+Brussels+Capital,+Belgium&units=|title=Brussels, Belgium Climate Classification Köppen (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref">{{Cite web |title=Brussels, Belgium Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase) |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=15460&cityname=Brussels,+Brussels+Capital,+Belgium&units= |access-date=2019-07-02 |website=Weatherbase}}</ref> Proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements in the period 1981–2010), there are approximately 135 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region. Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. The city also often experiences violent thunderstorms in summer months.

==Brussels as a capital==
Despite its name, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of [[Belgium]]. Article 194 of the [[Belgian Constitution]] establishes that the capital of Belgium is the [[City of Brussels]], the municipality in the region that is the city's core.<ref name="article 194" />

The City of Brussels is the location of many national institutions. The [[Royal Palace of Brussels]], where the [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]] exercises his prerogatives as head of state, is situated alongside [[Brussels Park|Brussels' Park]] (not to be confused with the [[Palace of Laeken|Royal Palace of Laeken]], the official home of the Belgian Royal Family). The [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Palace of the Nation]] is located on the opposite side of this park, and is the seat of the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]]. The office of the [[Prime Minister of Belgium]], colloquially called ''Law Street 16'' ({{lang-fr|16, rue de la Loi|link=no}}, {{lang-nl|Wetstraat 16|link=no}}), is located adjacent to this building. It is also where the [[Council of Ministers (Belgium)|Council of Ministers]] holds its meetings. The [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], Belgium's main court, has its seat in the [[Palace of Justice (Brussels)|Palace of Justice]]. Other important institutions in the City of Brussels are the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium|Constitutional Court]], the [[Council of State (Belgium)|Council of State]], the [[Court of Audit of Belgium|Court of Audit]], the [[Royal Belgian Mint]] and the [[National Bank of Belgium]].

The City of Brussels is also the capital of both the [[French Community of Belgium]]<ref name="décret" /> and the [[Flemish Community]].<ref name="decreet" /> The [[Flemish Parliament]] and [[Flemish Government]] have their seats in Brussels,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brussels, the capital of Flanders |url=http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1166590837731&context=1166590833692--EN&p=1166590837731&pagename=flanders_site%2FView |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610162638/http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1166590837731&context=1166590833692--EN&p=1166590837731&pagename=flanders_site%2FView |archive-date=10 June 2011 |access-date=6 November 2009 |publisher=Flemish Department of Foreign Affairs |df=dmy}}</ref> and so do the [[Parliament of the French Community]] and the [[Government of the French Community]].

The largest municipality in area and population is the City of Brussels, covering {{convert|32.6|km2|sqmi|1}} and with 145,917 inhabitants; the least populous is [[Koekelberg]] with 18,541 inhabitants. The smallest in area is [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]], which is only {{convert|1.1|km2|sqmi|1}}, but still has the highest population density in the region, with {{Convert|20822|PD/km2}}. [[Watermael-Boitsfort]] has the lowest population density in the region, with {{Convert|1928|PD/km2}}.

There is much controversy on the division of 19 municipalities for a highly urbanised region, which is considered as (half of) one city by most people. Some politicians mock the "19 baronies" and want to merge the municipalities under one city council and one mayor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fusie van de 19 Brusselse gemeenten |url=http://peterdedecker.eu/blog/2009/01/23/fusie_van_de_19_brusselse_gemeenten |access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=De Brusselse Baronieën |url=http://www.vlaamsbelang.org/nieuws/4237 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903210953/http://www.vlaamsbelang.org/nieuws/4237 |archive-date=3 September 2015 |access-date=26 August 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> That would lower the number of politicians needed to govern Brussels, and centralise the power over the city to make decisions easier, thus reduce the overall running costs. The current municipalities could be transformed into districts with limited responsibilities, similar to the current structure of [[Antwerp]] or to structures of other capitals like the [[London boroughs|boroughs]] in [[London]] or ''[[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]]'' in [[Paris]], to keep politics close enough to the citizen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bruxelles vaut bien une messe? |url=https://www.vub.ac.be/home/academischeopening/archief/0506/Bruxellesvautbienunemesse.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812052919/https://www.vub.ac.be/home/academischeopening/archief/0506/Bruxellesvautbienunemesse.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2014 |access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref>

==Brussels-Capital Region==
[[File:Regions of Belgium.svg|thumb|Regions of Belgium:
{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Region]]}}{{legend|#2385d2|Brussels-Capital Region}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[Wallonia|Walloon Region]]}}]]

===Political status===
{{see also|Partition of Belgium#Brussels|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Brussels}}The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] and the [[Flemish Region]]. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual [[enclave]] in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions; the three communities being the other component. Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]] for matters such as culture and education, as well as a [[Common Community Commission|Common Community]] for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and social [[welfare]].

Since the split of [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]] in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the [[provinces of Belgium]], nor is it subdivided into provinces itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Remaining is only the [[governor of Brussels-Capital]] and some aides, analogously to provinces. Its status is roughly akin to that of a [[federal district]].

===Institutions===
{{Main|Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region}}
[[File:Parlement région Bruxelles-Capitale.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Brussels Parliament building]]|alt=]]
The Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region|parliament]] of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking—parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region|minister-president]], four ministers and three [[Secretary of state|state secretaries]]. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact [[Ordinance (Belgium)|ordinances]] ({{lang-fr|ordonnances|link=no}}, {{lang-nl|ordonnanties|link=no}}), which have equal status as a national legislative act.

19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the [[Parliament of the French Community of Belgium]], and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the [[Flemish Parliament]]. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.

===Agglomeration of Brussels===
Before the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the Brussels Agglomeration. The Brussels Agglomeration was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wet houdende organisatie van de agglomeraties en de federaties van gemeenten |url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&cn=1971072630&table_name=wet |access-date=11 September 2015 |website=Belgiëlex.be |publisher=FOD Justitie}}</ref>

The Brussels Agglomeration had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.

After the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the Brussels Agglomeration was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.

==French and Flemish communities==
{{Main|French Community Commission|Flemish Community Commission}}
[[File:Communities of Belgium.svg|thumb|Communities of Belgium:
{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Community]] / Dutch language area}}{{legend striped|#fab274|#f2536b|Flemish & French Community / bilingual language area|up=yes}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] / French language area}}{{legend|#40bb6a|[[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]] / German language area}}]]
The [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the [[French Community Commission]] ({{lang-fr|Commission communautaire française|link=no}} or COCOF) and the [[Flemish Community Commission]] ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie|link=no}} or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]]. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.

The French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area).<ref>Procedure contained in art. 138 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community.<ref>Procedure in art. 137 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical [[federalism]]. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact [[decree]]s, which are legislative acts.

===Common Community Commission===
A bi-communitarian public authority, the [[Common Community Commission]] ({{lang-fr|Commission communautaire commune|link=no}}, COCOM, {{lang-nl|Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie|link=no}}, GGC) also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers—not the secretaries of state—of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact [[by-law]]s. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.

==International institutions==
Brussels has, since [[World War II]], become the administrative centre of many international organisations. The [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the [[World Customs Organization]] and [[EUROCONTROL]], as well as international corporations.

==Demographics==

===Population===
[[File:EU NUTS 2 population density 2007.svg|thumb|left|[[Population density]] of Europe. Brussels is located between the largest urban centres.]]
Brussels is located in one of the most [[Blue Banana|urbanised regions of Europe]], between [[Paris]], [[London]], the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] ([[Germany]]), and the [[Randstad]] ([[Netherlands]]). The Brussels-Capital Region has a population of around 1.2&nbsp;million and has witnessed, in recent years, a remarkable increase in its population. In general, the population of Brussels is younger than the national average, and the gap between rich and poor is wider.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Très riches et très pauvres |url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/bruxelles/article/616278/tres-riches-et-tres-pauvres.html |access-date=12 March 2013 |publisher=Lalibre.be}}</ref>

Brussels is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond the region's limits. Sometimes referred to as the urban area of Brussels ({{lang-fr|aire urbaine de Bruxelles|link=no}}, {{lang-nl|stedelijk gebied van Brussel|link=no}}) or Greater Brussels ({{lang-fr|Grand-Bruxelles|link=no}}, {{lang-nl|Groot-Brussel|link=no}}), this area extends over a large part of the two Brabant provinces, including much of the surrounding [[arrondissement of Halle-Vilvoorde]] and some small parts of the [[arrondissement of Leuven]] in [[Flemish Brabant]], as well as the northern part of [[Walloon Brabant]].

The metropolitan area of Brussels is divided into three levels. Firstly, the central agglomeration (within the regional borders), with a population of 1,218,255 inhabitants.<ref name=":8" /> Adding the closest suburbs ({{lang-fr|banlieues|link=no}}, {{lang-nl|buitenwijken|link=no}}) gives a total population of 1,831,496. Including the outer [[commuter]] zone ([[Brussels Regional Express Network]] (RER/GEN) area), the population is 2,676,701.<ref name="BelMetr" /><ref name=":5" /> Brussels is also part of a wider [[Flemish Diamond|diamond-shaped]] [[conurbation]], with [[Ghent]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Leuven]], which has about 4.4&nbsp;million inhabitants (a little more than 40% of the Belgium's total population).{{sfn|Van Meeteren|Boussauw|Derudder|Witlox|2016}}<ref name="Meijers-2007">{{Cite book |last=Meijers |first=Evert J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UhMjzogIa_UC&q=Flemish+Diamond&pg=PT62 |title=Synergy in Polycentric Urban Regions: Complementarity, Organising Capacity and Critical Mass |date=2007 |publisher=IOS Press |isbn=9781586037246 |page=54 |language=en}}</ref>

Brussels is home to a large number of immigrants and people of immigrant background. At the last Belgian census in 1991, 63.7% of inhabitants in Brussels-Capital Region answered that they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium, indicating that more than a third of residents had not been born in the country.<ref name="philippevanparijs">{{cite journal|title=Belgium's new linguistic challenges |author-link=Philippe Van Parijs |author=Van Parijs, Philippe |journal=KVS Express (Supplement to Newspaper de Morgen) March–April 2007 |pages=Article from [http://www.kvs.be/kvs_express/KVS_EXPRESS_13_WEB.pdf original source (pdf 4.9&nbsp;MB)] pages 34–36 republished by the Belgian Federal Government Service (ministry) of Economy – Directorate–general Statistics Belgium |url=http://www.statbel.fgov.be/studies/ac699_en.pdf |format=pdf 0.7&nbsp;MB |access-date=5 May 2007 |no-pp=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613234540/http://www.statbel.fgov.be/studies/ac699_en.pdf |archive-date=13 June 2007 }} – The linguistic situation in Belgium (and in particular various estimations of the population speaking French and Dutch in Brussels) is discussed in detail.{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.kvs.be/kvs_express/KVS_EXPRESS_13_WEB.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325104118/http://www.kvs.be/kvs_express/KVS_EXPRESS_13_WEB.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2009 |access-date=11 July 2008 |df=dmy}}</ref><ref name="ibsa">{{Cite web |title=Population et ménages |url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/cmsmedia/fr/is_2006_population_menages.pdf?uri=43742a9611346ccd0111374fb94f0351 |access-date=5 May 2007 |publisher=IBSA Cellule statistique – Min.

This large concentration of immigrants and their descendance includes many of [[Moroccans in Belgium|Moroccan]] (mainly [[Riffian people|Riffian]] and [[Berbers|Berber]]) and Turkish ancestry, together with French-speaking black Africans from former [[Belgian overseas colonies|Belgian colonies]], such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].

About 32% of city residents are of non-Belgian [[Europe]]an origin (mainly expatriates from France, Romania, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Portugal) and 36% are of another background, mostly from [[Morocco]], [[Turkey]] and Sub-Saharan [[Africa]].

According to Statbel, the Belgian statistical office, in 2020, taking into account the nationality of birth of the parents, 74.3% of the population of the Brussels-Capital region was of foreign origin and 41.8% was of non-European origin (including 28.7% of African origin).

Historically, Brussels has been predominantly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], especially since the expulsion of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the 16th century. This is clear from the large number of historical churches in the region, particularly in the [[City of Brussels]]. The pre-eminent Catholic [[cathedral]] in Brussels is the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]], serving as the [[co-cathedral]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels|Archdiocese of Mechelen–Brussels]]. On the north-western side of the region, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|National Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] is a [[Minor Basilica]] and [[parish church]], as well as the [[List of largest church buildings|14th largest church building]] in the world. The [[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]] holds the tombs of many members of the [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgian royal family]], including all the former [[List of Belgian monarchs|Belgian monarchs]], within the [[Royal Crypt (Belgium)|Royal Crypt]].

In reflection of its multicultural makeup, Brussels hosts a variety of religious communities, as well as large numbers of [[atheism|atheists]] and [[agnosticism|agnostics]]. Minority faiths include [[Islam]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Judaism]], and [[Buddhism]]. According to a 2016 survey, approximately 40% of residents of Brussels declared themselves [[Catholics]] (12% were practising Catholics and 28% were non-practising Catholics), 30% were [[Irreligion|non-religious]], 23% were [[Muslim]] (19% practising, 4% non-practising), 3% were [[Protestant Christian|Protestants]] and 4% were of another religion.<ref name="2016religion">{{Cite news |last=Elodie Blogie |date=28 January 2016 |title=75% des francophones revendiquent une identité religieuse |language=fr |work=Le Soir.be |url=http://www.lesoir.be/1106186/article/actualite/belgique/2016-01-28/75-des-francophones-revendiquent-une-identite-religieuse |access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref>

===Architecture===
The architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the clashing combination of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], and [[Louis XIV style|Louis XIV]] styles on the [[Grand Place]] to the [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] buildings of the [[Brussels and the European Union|EU institutions]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brussels Architecture Sights |url=https://www.brussels.info/architecture/ |access-date=18 October 2017 |website=brussels.info}}</ref>

[[File:Bruxelles Manneken Pis.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Manneken Pis]]'' is a well-known public sculpture in Brussels.]]
Very little [[medieval architecture]] is preserved in Brussels. Buildings from that period are mostly found in the historical centre (called {{lang|fr|Îlot Sacré|italic=no}}), [[Saint-Géry Island|Saint Géry/Sint-Goriks]] and {{lang|fr|Sainte-Catherine|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Sint Katelijne|italic=no}} neighbourhoods. The [[Brabantine Gothic]] [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] remains a prominent feature in the skyline of downtown Brussels. Isolated portions of the [[Fortifications of Brussels#First_walls|first city walls]] were saved from destruction and can be seen to this day. One of the only remains of the [[Fortifications of Brussels#Second_walls|second walls]] is the [[Halle Gate]]. The [[Grand Place]] is the main attraction in the city centre and has been a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1998.<ref>{{Cite web |title=La Grand-Place, Brussels |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/857 |access-date=6 February 2017 |website=whc.unesco.org |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en}}</ref> The square is dominated by the 15th century [[Flamboyant]] [[Brussels Town Hall|Town Hall]], the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] ''[[Museum of the City of Brussels|Breadhouse]]'' and the Baroque [[guildhall]]s of the former [[Guilds of Brussels]].

The [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style of the 18th and 19th centuries is represented in the Royal Quarter/Coudenberg area, around [[Brussels Park|Brussels' Park]] and the [[Place Royale, Brussels|Place Royale/Koningsplein]]. Examples include the [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]], the [[Saint-Jacques-sur-Coudenberg|Church of St. James on Coudenberg]], the [[Belgian Federal Parliament#Palace_of_the_Nation|Palace of the Nation]] (Parliament building), the [[Academy Palace]], the [[Palace of Charles of Lorraine]], the [[Palace of the Count of Flanders]] and the [[Egmont Palace]]. Other uniform neoclassical ensembles can be found around the [[Place des Martyrs, Brussels|Place des Martyrs/Martelaarsplein]] and the {{lang|fr|Place de Barricades|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl| Barricadenplein|italic=no}}. Some additional landmarks in the centre are the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert|Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries]] (1847), one of the oldest covered shopping arcades in Europe, the [[Congress Column]] (1859), the former [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] building (1873) and the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883). The latter, designed by [[Joseph Poelaert]], in [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] style, is reputed to be the largest building constructed in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Le Palais de Justice de Bruxelles |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5357/ |access-date=3 February 2017 |website=whc.unesco.org |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en}}</ref>

Located outside the historical centre, in a greener environment bordering the [[Brussels and the European Union#European_Quarter|European Quarter]], are the [[Cinquantenaire|Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark]] with its [[Arcade du Cinquantenaire|memorial arcade]] and nearby museums, and in [[Laeken]], the [[Palace of Laeken|Royal Palace of Laeken]] and the Royal Domain with its large [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken|greenhouses]], as well as the [[Museums of the Far East]].

Also particularly striking are the buildings in the [[Art Nouveau in Brussels|Art Nouveau]] style, most famously by the Belgian architects [[Victor Horta]], [[Paul Hankar]] and [[Henry Van de Velde]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=10 must-visit world-class Art Nouveau buildings in Brussels! |url=https://visit.brussels/en/article/10-must-visit-world-class-art-nouveau-buildings-in-brussels |access-date=18 October 2017 |website=visit.brussels |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Stambolic |first=Ana |title=The Most Remarkable Art Nouveau Houses In Brussels |work=Culture Trip |url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/the-most-remarkable-art-nouveau-houses-in-brussels/ |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> Some of Brussels' municipalities, such as [[Schaerbeek]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Ixelles]], and [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]], were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau and have many buildings in that style.

[[Art Deco in Brussels|Art Deco]] structures in Brussels include the Residence Palace (1927) (now part of the [[Europa building]]), the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Centre for Fine Arts]] (1928), the [[Villa Empain]] (1934), the [[Forest Town Hall|Town Hall of Forest]] (1938), and the [[Flagey Building]] (formerly known as the ''Maison de la Radio'') on the [[Place Eugène Flagey|Place Eugène Flagey/Eugène Flageyplein]] (1938) in Ixelles. Some religious buildings from the [[Interwar period|interwar era]] were also constructed in that style, such as the [[Church of St. John the Baptist, Molenbeek|Church of St. John the Baptist]] (1932) in Molenbeek and the [[Church of St. Augustine, Forest|Church of St. Augustine]] (1935) in Forest. Completed only in 1969, and combining Art Deco with [[Byzantine Revival architecture|neo-Byzantine]] elements, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in [[Koekelberg]] is one of the [[List of largest church buildings in the world|largest churches by area in the world]], and its [[cupola]] provides a panoramic view of Brussels and its outskirts.

Since the second half of the 20th century, modern office towers have been built in Brussels ([[Madou Plaza Tower|Madou Tower]], [[Rogier Tower]], [[Proximus Towers]], [[Finance Tower]], the [[World Trade Center (Brussels)|World Trade Center]], among others). There are some thirty towers, mostly concentrated in the city's [[central business district|main business district]]: the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]] (also called ''Little Manhattan''), near [[Brussels-North railway station]]. The [[South Tower (Brussels)|South Tower]], standing adjacent to [[Brussels-South railway station]], is the [[List of tallest structures in Belgium|tallest building in Belgium]], at {{cvt|148|m}}. Along the [[North–South connection]], is the State Administrative City, an administrative complex in the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]]. The postmodern buildings of the [[Espace Leopold|Espace Léopold]] complete the picture.

The city's embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach towards historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, most famously the [[Maison du Peuple (Brussels)|''Maison du Peuple''/''Volkshuis'']] by Victor Horta, a process known as [[Brusselization|Brusselisation]].{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|p=121}}

===Folklore===
[[File:GeantsMeyboom2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Meyboom]] giants in Brussels, a [[UNESCO]] [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage]]]]
Brussels' identity owes much to its rich folklore and traditions, among the liveliest in the country.
* The [[Ommegang of Brussels|Ommegang]], a folkloric costumed procession, commemorating the [[Joyous Entry]] of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] and his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in the city in 1549, takes place every year in July. The colourful parade includes floats, traditional processional giants, such as [[Saint Michael]] and [[Saint Gudula]], and scores of folkloric groups, either on foot or on horseback, dressed in medieval garb. The parade ends in a [[Medieval pageant|pageant]] on the [[Grand Place]]. Since 2019, it is recognised as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=UNESCO - Ommegang of Brussels, an annual historical procession and popular festival|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/lists|access-date=2021-06-11|website=ich.unesco.org|language=en}}</ref>
* The [[Meyboom]], an even-older folk tradition of Brussels (1308), celebrating the May tree—in fact, a bad translation of the Dutch ''tree of joy''—takes place paradoxically on 9 August. After parading a young [[beech]] in the city, it is planted in a joyful spirit with lots of music, ''Brusseleir'' songs, and processional giants. It was also recognised as an expression of [[intangible cultural heritage]] by UNESCO, as part of the bi-national inscription "[[Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://be.brussels/culture-tourism-leisure/brussels-folklore/meyboom |title=Meyboom |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=10 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/processional-giants-and-dragons-in-belgium-and-france-00153 |title=Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France – intangible heritage – Culture Sector – UNESCO |website=ich.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref> The celebration is reminiscent of the town's long-standing (folkloric) feud with [[Leuven]], which dates back to the [[Middle Ages]].
* Another good introduction to the ''Brusseleir'' [[Marols|local dialect]] and way of life can be obtained at the [[Royal Theatre Toone]], a folkloric theatre of [[marionette]]s, located a stone's throw away from the Grand Place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toone.be/spip.php?page=choix_lang|title=Théâtre Royal de Toone|website=www.toone.be|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref>
* The [[St V|Saint-Verhaegen]] (often shortened to ''St V''), a folkloric student procession, celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB) and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] (VUB), is held on 20 November.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Brussels waffle.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brussels is known for its local [[Belgian waffle|waffles]].]]
Brussels is known for its local [[Belgian waffle|waffle]], its [[chocolate]], its [[French fries]] and its numerous types of [[beer]]s. The [[Brussels sprout]], which has long been popular in Brussels, and may have originated there, is also named after the city.<ref>{{cite web | last = Oliver | first = Lynne |title = Food Timeline: Brussels sprouts | date = 11 April 2011 | url =http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq.html#brussels | access-date =9 April 2012 }}</ref>

The gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 [[restaurant]]s (including three 2-starred and ten 1-starred [[Michelin Guide|Michelin]] restaurants),<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brussels 2 Stars MICHELIN MICHELIN Restaurants – the MICHELIN Guide Belgium|url=https://guide.michelin.com/en/be/bruxelles-capitale/restaurants/2-stars-michelin/1-star-michelin|access-date=2021-02-10|website=MICHELIN Guide|language=en-US}}</ref> and a number of bars. In addition to the traditional restaurants, there are many [[Coffeehouse|cafés]], [[bistro]]s and the usual range of international [[Fast food restaurant|fast food]] chains. The cafés are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; [[Coffeehouse|coffee houses]] are called {{lang|fr|salons de thé}} (literally "tea salons"). Also widespread are [[brasserie]]s, which usually offer a variety of beers and typical national dishes.

[[Belgian cuisine]] is known among connoisseurs as one of the best in Europe. It is characterised by the combination of [[French cuisine]] with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include [[Brussels waffle]]s (gaufres) and [[mussels]] (usually as [[moules frites|''moules-frites'']], served with fries). The city is a stronghold of [[chocolate]] and [[praline]]s manufacturers with renowned companies like [[Côte d'Or (chocolate)|Côte d'Or]], [[Chocolatier Neuhaus|Neuhaus]], [[Leonidas (chocolate maker)|Leonidas]] and [[Godiva Chocolatier|Godiva]]. Pralines were first introduced in 1912 by Jean Neuhaus II, a Belgian [[chocolatier]] of Swiss origin, in the Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/travel/brussels-the-chocolate-trail.html|title=Brussels: The Chocolate Trail|last=Thomas|first=Amy M.|date=22 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> Numerous [[friteries]] are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh hot waffles are also sold on the street.

As well as other [[Beer in Belgium|Belgian beer]]s, the [[Spontaneous fermentation|spontaneously fermented]] [[lambic]] style, brewed in and around Brussels, is widely available there and in the nearby [[Zenne|Senne]] valley where the wild yeasts which ferment it have their origin. [[Kriek lambic|Kriek]], a cherry lambic, is available in almost every bar or restaurant in Brussels.

Brussels is known as the birthplace of the [[Chicory|Belgian endive]]. The technique for growing [[Blanching (horticulture)|blanched]] endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the [[Botanical Garden of Brussels]] in [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729081033/http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 July 2005|title=Food Museum, Belgium Endive|date=29 July 2005|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Bourse Bxl 02.JPG|thumb|The former [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] building]]

There are approximately 50,000 [[business]]es in Brussels, of which around 2,200 are foreign. This number is constantly increasing and can well explain the role of Brussels in Europe. The city's [[infrastructure]] is very favourable in terms of starting up a new business. House prices have also increased in recent years, especially with the increase of young [[professional]]s settling down in Brussels, making it the most expensive city to live in Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/country/belgium#all-cities|title=Cost of Living in Belgium.|website=Expatistan, cost of living comparisons|language=en|access-date=26 March 2017}}</ref> In addition, Brussels holds more than 1,000 business conferences annually, making it the ninth most popular conference city in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvent.com/uk/event-venue-supplier-network/top-25/2015-top-destinations-europe.shtml|title=Cvent's Top 25 Meeting Destinations in the Europe|website=www.cvent.com|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref>

Brussels is rated as the 34th most important financial centre in the world as of 2020, according to the [[Global Financial Centres Index]]. The [[Brussels Stock Exchange]], abbreviated to BSE, now called ''Euronext Brussels'', is part of the European [[stock exchange]] [[Euronext N.V.]], along with [[Paris Bourse]], [[Lisbon Stock Exchange]] and [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]]. Its benchmark [[stock market index]] is the [[BEL20]].

==Media==
{{Further|Belgian media}}
Brussels is a centre of both media and communications in Belgium, with many Belgian television stations, radio stations, [[newspaper]]s and telephone companies having their headquarters in the region. The Belgian French-language [[Public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] [[RTBF]], the Belgian Dutch-speaking public broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]], the two regional channels BX1 (formerly Télé Bruxelles)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bx1.be/|title=BX1, La chaîne d'info de Bruxelles|website=BX1|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref> and [[Bruzz]] (formerly TV Brussel),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruzz.be/en|title=Nieuws uit Brussel en de beste cultuurtips|website=www.bruzz.be|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref> the encrypted [[BeTV (Belgium)|BeTV]] channel and private channels [[RTL-TVI]] and [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]] are headquartered in Brussels. Some national newspapers such as [[Le Soir]], [[La Libre Belgique|La Libre]], [[De Morgen]] and the [[news agency]] [[Belga (news agency)|Belga]] are based in or around Brussels. The Belgian [[Mail|postal]] company [[bpost]], as well as the telecommunication companies and mobile operators [[Proximus]], [[Orange Belgium]] and [[Telenet (Belgium)|Telenet]] are all located there.

As English is spoken widely,<ref name="BruS13EN" /><ref name=":7" /> several English media organisations operate in Brussels. The most popular of these are the English-language daily news media platform and bi-monthly magazine ''[[The Brussels Times]]'' and the quarterly magazine and website ''[[The Bulletin (Brussels weekly)|The Bulletin]]''. The [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] [[Pan-European identity|pan-European]] news channel [[Euronews]] also maintains an office in Brussels.

Also a dozen of university colleges are located in Brussels, including two drama schools, founded in 1832: the French-speaking [[Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|Conservatoire Royal]] and its [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] equivalent, the [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Petite histoire du Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|publisher=Conservatoire Royal|url=http://www.conservatoire.be/historique.html|access-date=9 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel |publisher=[[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]] |url=http://www.kcb.be/eng/indexin.asp?pag=bib&nr=1 |access-date=9 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013223138/http://www.kcb.be/eng/indexin.asp?pag=bib&nr=1 |archive-date=13 October 2006 }}</ref>

===Primary and secondary education===
Most of Brussels pupils between the ages of 3 and 18 go to schools organised by the [[French-speaking Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]], with close to 80% going to French-speaking schools, and roughly 20% to Dutch-speaking schools. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the [[International School of Brussels]], with 1,450 pupils, between the ages of 2{{frac|2}} and 18,<ref>{{cite web|title=ISB Profile |publisher=[[International School of Brussels]] |url=http://www.isb.be/page.cfm?p=7 |access-date=9 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017045221/http://www.isb.be/page.cfm?p=7 |archive-date=17 October 2007 }}</ref> the [[British School of Brussels]], and the four [[European School]]s, which provide free education for the children of those working in the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]].

[[File:Projet de l'Hôpital Erasme par MA².jpg|thumb|[[Erasmus Hospital]] in [[Anderlecht]]|alt=]]

===Healthcare===
{{Main|List of hospitals in Belgium#Brussels-Capital Region}}
Brussels is home to a thriving [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and [[health care]] industry which includes pioneering [[biotechnology]] research. The health sector employs 70,000 employees in 30,000 companies. There are 3,000 life sciences researchers in the city and two large [[science park]]s: [[Da Vinci Research Park]] and [[Erasmus Research Park]]. There are five [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]], a [[military hospital]] and more than 40 general hospitals and specialist clinics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitals.be/|title=Belgian Association of Hospitals|website=www.hospitals.be|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

Due to [[Languages of Belgium|its bilingual nature]], hospitals in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] can be either monolingual French, monolingual Dutch, or bilingual, depending on their nature. University hospitals belong to one of the two [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|linguistic communities]] and are thus monolingual French or Dutch by law. Other hospitals managed by a public authority must be legally bilingual. Private hospitals are legally not bound to either language, but most cater to both. However, all hospital emergency services in the Capital Region (whether part of a public or private hospital) are required to be bilingual, since patients transported by emergency [[ambulance]] cannot choose the hospital they will be brought to.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zorg-en-gezondheid.be/welke-taal-moeten-de-brusselse-ziekenhuizen-gebruiken|title=Welke taal moeten de Brusselse ziekenhuizen gebruiken?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zorg-en-gezondheid.be|publisher=[[Agency for Care and Health (Flanders)|Agency for Care and Health]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=Which language do hospitals in Brussels have to use?|access-date=18 September 2019}}</ref>

==Transport==

===Air===
[[File:Brussels Airlines Airbus A319 landing at Brussels Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Brussels Airlines]] Airbus A319 landing at [[Brussels Airport]] in [[Zaventem]]]]
The Brussels-Capital Region is served by several airports, all of which are located outside of the administrative territory of the region. The most notable are:
* [[Brussels Airport|Brussels-National Airport]], located in the nearby Flemish municipality of [[Zaventem]], {{convert|12|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} east of the capital;
* [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], located in [[Gosselies]], a part of the city of [[Charleroi]] ([[Wallonia]]), some {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south-west of Brussels;
* [[Melsbroek Air Base]], located in [[Steenokkerzeel]], is mainly a military airport and is used in a minority way for civilian travelers.
The first two are also the main airports of Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brussels.info/airports/|title=Brussels.info – Brussels Airports|website=www.brussels.info|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

===Water===
[[File:Eugène Boudin 005.jpg|thumb|''The Saint Catherine Dock'', Eugène Boudin, 1871|left]]
Since the 16th century, Brussels has had its own harbour, the [[port of Brussels]]. It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the {{lang|fr|Place Sainte-Catherine|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Sint-Katelijneplein|italic=no}}, it lies today to the northwest of the region, on the [[Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal]] (commonly called Willebroek Canal), which connects Brussels to [[Antwerp]] via the [[Scheldt]]. Ships and large barges up to {{convert|4,500|t|lb}} can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, and thus offering a competitive advantage.

Moreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the [[Brussels–Charleroi Canal]], in the very heart of the capital, creates a north–south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] ([[Wallonia]]). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important [[Canal inclined plane|inclined plane]] of [[Ronquières inclined plane|Ronquières]] and the lifts of [[Strépy-Bracquegnies]].

The importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year—almost 2,000 per day—which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of  {{convert|51,545|t|lb}} per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.port.brussels/en|title=Port of Brussels|website=Port of Brussels|language=en|access-date=4 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804221507/http://www.port.brussels/en|archive-date=4 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Brussels-Capital Region has three main train stations: [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]], [[Brussels-Central railway station|Brussels-Central]] and [[Brussels-North railway station|Brussels-North]], which are also the busiest of the country.<ref name=":2" /> Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to [[London]] by [[Eurostar]] trains via the [[Channel Tunnel]] (1hr 51min); to [[Amsterdam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|title=Distance between Brussels, Belgium and Amsterdam, The Netherlands|work=Distances Technology|access-date=11 Feb 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212004929/http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|archive-date=12 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> by [[Thalys]] and ''InterCity'' connections; to Amsterdam, [[Paris]] (1hr 50min and 1hr 25min respectively {{as of|lc=y|2015|April|6}}), and [[Cologne]] by [[Thalys]]; and to Cologne (1hr 50min) and [[Frankfurt]] (2hr 57min) by the German [[Intercity Express|ICE]].

The train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the [[North–South connection]], with Brussels Central Station also being largely underground. The tunnel itself is only six tracks wide at its narrowest point, which often causes congestion and delays due to heavy use of the route.

The [[City of Brussels]] has minor railway stations at [[Bockstael railway station|Bockstael]], [[Brussels-Chapel railway station|Brussels-Chapel]], [[Brussels-Congres railway station|Brussels-Congres]], [[Brussels-Luxembourg railway station|Brussels-Luxembourg]], [[Schuman station|Brussels-Schuman]], [[Brussels-West station|Brussels-West]], [[Haren railway station (Brussels)|Haren]], [[Haren-South railway station|Haren-South]] and [[Simonis metro station|Simonis]]. In the Brussels Region, there are also railways stations at [[Berchem-Sainte-Agathe railway station|Berchem-Sainte-Agathe]], [[Boitsfort railway station|Boitsfort]], [[Boondael railway station|Boondael]], [[Bordet railway station|Bordet (Evere)]], [[Etterbeek railway station|Etterbeek]], [[Evere railway station|Evere]], [[Forest-East railway station|Forest-East]], [[Forest-South railway station|Forest-South]], [[Jette railway station|Jette]], [[Meiser railway station|Meiser (Schaerbeek)]], [[Moensberg railway station|Moensberg (Uccle)]], [[Saint-Job railway station|Saint-Job (Uccle)]], [[Schaerbeek railway station|Schaarbeek]], [[Uccle-Calevoet railway station|Uccle-Calevoet]], [[Uccle-Stalle railway station|Uccle-Stalle]], Vivier d'Oie-Diesdelle (Uccle), [[Merode station|Merode]] and [[Watermael railway station|Watermael]].

===City public transport===
The Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company ([[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|STIB/MIVB]]) is the local [[public transport]] operator in Brussels. It covers the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region and some surface routes extend to the near suburbs in the other two regions.

====Metro====
[[File:Rame "Boa".jpg|thumb|[[Brussels metro]] carriage at [[Erasmus metro station|Erasme/Erasmus metro station]]|left]]
The [[Brussels metro]] dates back to 1976,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/brussels/|title=Brussels Metro and Tram Network|work=Railway Technology|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> but underground lines known as the [[Brussels premetro|''premetro'']] have been serviced by tramways since 1968. It is the only [[rapid transit]] system in Belgium ([[Antwerp Pre-metro|Antwerp]] and [[Charleroi Metro|Charleroi]] both having [[light rail]] systems). The network consists of four conventional metro lines and three ''premetro'' lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6, with some shared sections, covering a total of {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="The network and vehicles">{{Cite news|url=http://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?_guid=8086313c-3883-3410-f894-ec3da5b1280e&l=en|title=The network and vehicles|work=STIB-MIVB|access-date=27 February 2017|language=fr-FR}}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the metro network within the region has a total of 69 metro and ''premetro'' stations. The metro is an important [[Transport in Brussels|means of transport]], connecting with six [[railway station]]s of the [[National Railway Company of Belgium]] (NMBS/SNCB), and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[De Lijn]] and [[Wallonia|Walloon]] [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] bus stops.

====Trams and buses====
A comprehensive [[Brussels buses|bus]] and [[Brussels trams|tram network]] covers the region. {{As of|2017}}, the Brussels tram system consists of 17 tram lines (three of which – lines T3, T4 and T7 – qualify as ''premetro'' lines). The total route length is {{convert|139|km|abbr=on}},<ref name="The network and vehicles"/> making it one of the largest tram networks in Europe. The Brussels bus network is complementary to the rail network. It consists of 50 bus routes and 11 night routes, spanning {{convert|445|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="The network and vehicles"/> Since April 2007, STIB/MIVB has been operating a night bus network called Noctis. On Fridays and Saturdays, 11 bus routes operate from midnight until 3 a.m. They run from the centre of Brussels to the outer reaches of the Brussels-Capital Region.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm/4353 |title=Metro, tram and bus in Brussels |website=City of Brussels |language=en |access-date=27 February 2017|date=2016-10-28 }}</ref>

====Ticketing====
An interticketing system means that a STIB/MIVB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the region. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by [[De Lijn]], [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|NMBS/SNCB]] will, in the next few years,{{when|date=September 2016}} be augmented by the [[Brussels Regional Express Network]] (RER/GEN), which will connect the capital and surrounding towns. Since August 2016, paper tickets have been discontinued in favour of electronic MoBIB cards.

====Other public transport====
[[File:VilloStationAlmostFull.jpg|thumb|[[Villo!]] bicycles in Brussels]]
Since 2003, Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the [[Bremen]] company Cambio, in partnership with the STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company Taxi Stop. In 2006, a [[Community bicycle program|public bicycle-sharing programme]] was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by [[Villo!]]. Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by Collecto, a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the Zen Car electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.

In medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north–south (the modern {{lang|fr|Rue Haute|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hoogstraat|italic=no}}) and east–west ({{lang|fr|Chaussée de Gand|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Gentsesteenweg|italic=no}}–{{lang|fr|Rue du Marché aux Herbes|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Grasmarkt|italic=no}}–{{lang|fr|Rue de Namur|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Naamsestraat|italic=no}}). The ancient pattern of streets, radiating from the [[Grand Place]], in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built [[covering of the Senne|over the river Senne]], [[small ring (Brussels)|over the city walls]] and over the railway connection between the North and South Stations.

Today, Brussels has the most congested traffic in North America and Europe, according to US traffic information platform [[INRIX]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/brussels-and-antwerp-have-worst-traffic|title=Brussels and Antwerp have worst traffic|date=27 June 2012|access-date=8 December 2013|newspaper=Flanders Today}}</ref>

Brussels is the hub of a range of old national roads, the main ones being clockwise: the [[N1 road (Belgium)|N1]] (N to [[Breda]]), [[N2 road (Belgium)|N2]] (E to [[Maastricht]]), [[N3 road (Belgium)|N3]] (E to [[Aachen]]), [[N4 road (Belgium)|N4]] (SE to [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]]) [[N5 road (Belgium)|N5]] (S to [[Reims|Rheims]]), N6 (S to [[Maubeuge]]), N7 (SW to [[Lille]]), [[N8 road (Belgium)|N8]] (W to [[Koksijde]]) and N9 (NW to [[Ostend]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autosnelwegen.net/frames.html?/nb.html |title=Belgian N roads |publisher=Autosnelwegen.net |access-date=29 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529013951/http://www.autosnelwegen.net/frames.html?%2Fnb.html |archive-date=29 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Usually named {{lang|fr|chaussées}}/{{lang|nl|steenwegen}}, these highways normally run in a straight line, but sometimes lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.

The region is skirted by the [[European route E19]] (N-S) and the [[European route E40|E40]] (E-W), while the [[E411]] leads away to the SE. Brussels has an [[beltway|orbital motorway]], numbered R0 (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the [[Brussels Ring|Ring]]. It is pear-shaped, as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents' objections.

The city centre, sometimes known as the [[Pentagon (Brussels)|Pentagon]], is surrounded by an inner ring road, the [[small ring (Brussels)|Small Ring]] ({{lang-fr|Petite Ceinture|link=no}}, {{lang-nl|Kleine Ring|link=no}}), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 or N0. These were built upon the site of the [[second walls of Brussels|second set of city walls]] following their demolition. The [[Brussels Metro line 2|metro line 2]] runs under much of these. Since June 2015, a number of [[Central Boulevards of Brussels|central boulevards]] inside the Pentagon have become car-free, limiting transit traffic through the old city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://circulatieplan.be/en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514223301/http://circulatieplan.be/en |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 May 2015 |title=Circulation plan |access-date=26 August 2015 }}</ref>

On the eastern side of the region, the R21 or [[Greater ring (Brussels)|Greater Ring]] ({{lang-fr|Grande Ceinture|link=no}}, {{lang-nl|Grote Ring|link=no}}) is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from [[Laeken]] to [[Uccle]]. Some ''premetro'' stations (see [[Brussels metro]]) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to [[Uccle|Saint-Job]].

===Police===
{{Further|Law enforcement in Belgium}}
[[File:EPP Summit March 2012 (48).jpg|thumb|Policeman in Brussels]]

The Brussels local [[police]], supported by the federal police, is responsible for law enforcement in Brussels. The 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region are divided into six police zones,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policelocale.be/portal/fr/zones-de-police-liste/brussel-hoofdstad-bruxelles-capitale.html|title=Zones de police|website=www.policelocale.be|language=fr-fr|access-date=24 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325124440/http://www.policelocale.be/portal/fr/zones-de-police-liste/brussel-hoofdstad-bruxelles-capitale.html|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> all bilingual (French and Dutch):

* 5339 Brussels Capital Ixelles: the [[City of Brussels]] and [[Ixelles]]
* 5340 Brussels West: [[Sint-Agatha-Berchem|Berchem-Sainte-Agathe]], [[Ganshoren]], [[Jette]], [[Koekelberg]] and [[Molenbeek-Saint-Jean]]

===Fire department===
The Brussels Fire and Emergency Medical Care Service, commonly known by its acronym SIAMU (DBDMH), operates in the 19 municipalities of Brussels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://be.brussels/about-the-region/regional-bodies/fire-brigade |title=SIAMU |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=24 March 2017}}</ref> It is a class X fire department and the largest [[Fire department|fire service]] in Belgium in terms of annual operations, equipment, and personnel. It has 9 [[fire station]]s, spread over the entire Brussels-Capital Region, and employs about 1,000 professional [[firefighter]]s. As well as preventing and fighting fires, SIAMU also provides emergency medical care services in Brussels via its centralised 100 number (and the single 112 emergency number for the 27 countries of the European Union). It is bilingual (French–Dutch).

==Parks and green spaces==
{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Brussels}}

Brussels is one of the greenest capitals in Europe, with over 8,000 hectares of green spaces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://be.brussels/culture-tourism-leisure/parks-and-green-space |title=Parks and green spaces |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=10 February 2017}}</ref> Vegetation cover and natural areas are higher in the outskirts, where they have limited the [[peri-urbanisation]] of the capital, but they decrease sharply towards the centre of Brussels; 10% in the central [[Pentagon (Brussels)|Pentagon]], 30% of the municipalities in the first ring, and 71% of the municipalities in the second ring are occupied by green spaces.

Many parks and gardens, both public and privately owned, are scattered throughout the city. In addition to this, the [[Sonian Forest]] is located in its southern part and stretches out over the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Regions|Belgian regions]]. {{as of|2017}}, it has been inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], the only Belgian component to the multinational inscription '[[Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]]'.
