==Early life==
[[File:Maslach_and_Zimbardo-1972.jpg|thumb|left|Maslach and Zimbardo in 1972]]
Zimbardo was born in [[New York City]] on March 23, 1933, to a family of [[Italians|Italian]] immigrants from [[Sicily]]. Early in life he experienced discrimination and prejudice, growing up poor on [[welfare]] and being [[Italians|Italian]]. He was often mistaken for other races and ethnicities such as [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] or [[Black People|black]]. Zimbardo has said these experiences early in life triggered his curiosity about people's behavior, and later influenced his research in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200009/emperor-the-edge|title=Emperor of the Edge|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=January 5, 2018}}</ref>

He completed his B.A. with a triple major in [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[anthropology]] from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1954, where he graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]''. He completed his M.S. (1955) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1959) in psychology from [[Yale University]], where [[Neal E. Miller]] was his advisor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nealmiller.org/?p=252 |title=Phil Zimbardo Remembers |publisher=Neal Miller |date=April 15, 1954 |access-date=November 7, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008003128/http://nealmiller.org/?p=252 |archive-date=October 8, 2011  }}</ref> While at Yale, he married fellow graduate student [[Rose Abdelnour]]; they had a son in 1962 and divorced in 1971.<ref>{{cite book |last=Reginald |first=Robert |title=Contemporary Science Fiction Authors |publisher=Wildside Press |date=2009 |orig-date=1974 |page=297}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Mrs. Zimbardo Has Son |work=The New York Times |date=November 14, 1962 |page=46 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/11/14/archives/mrs-zimbardo-has-son.html}}</ref>

He taught at Yale from 1959 to 1960. From 1960 to 1967, he was a professor of psychology at [[New York University College of Arts & Science]]. From 1967 to 1968, he taught at [[Columbia University]]. He joined the faculty at [[Stanford University]] in 1968.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://exhibits.stanford.edu/spe/about/philip-g-zimbardo|title=Philip G.

==Stanford prison study==
{{main|Stanford prison experiment}}

===Background===
In 1971, Zimbardo accepted a tenured position as professor of psychology at Stanford University. With a government grant from the [[Office of Naval Research|U.S. Office of Naval Research]], he conducted the [[Stanford prison study]] in which male college students were selected (from an applicant pool of 75).

After a mental health screening, the remaining men were randomly assigned to be "prisoners" or "guards" in a mock prison located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford.<ref name="Stanford Prison">{{cite web|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment|url=https://documentaryheaven.com/the-stanford-prison-experiment/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007120927/http://documentaryheaven.com/the-stanford-prison-experiment/|archive-date=October 7, 2014|access-date=July 12, 2018}}</ref> 
Prisoners were confined to a 6' x 9' cell with black steel-barred doors. The only furniture in each cell was a cot. Solitary confinement was a small unlit closet.

Zimbardo's goal for the Stanford Prison study was to assess the psychological effect on a (randomly assigned) student of becoming a prisoner or prison guard.<ref name="ArchivedOfficial">{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-4.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000512020449/http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-4.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 12, 2000|website=Prisonexp.org|page=Slide 4|title=Slideshow on official site}}</ref>

A 1997 article from the Stanford News Service described the experiment's goals in more detail:
<blockquote>Zimbardo's primary reason for conducting the experiment was to focus on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity and situational validation of behavior that generally would repulse ordinary individuals. "I had been conducting research for some years on deindividuation, [[vandalism]] and dehumanization that illustrated the ease with which ordinary people could be led to engage in anti-social acts by putting them in situations where they felt anonymous, or they could perceive of others in ways that made them less than human, as enemies or objects," Zimbardo told the Toronto symposium in the summer of 1996.<ref name="spespa">{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment: Still powerful after all these years (1/97)|date=1996-08-12|publisher=News.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-07-12|quote=In the prison-conscious autumn of 1971, when George Jackson was killed at San Quentin and Attica erupted in even more deadly rebellion and retribution, the Stanford Prison Experiment made news in a big way. It offered the world a videotaped demonstration of how ordinary people, middle-class college students, can do things they would have never believed they were capable of doing. It seemed to say, as Hannah Arendt said of Adolf Eichmann, that normal people can take ghastly actions.}}</ref></blockquote>

===Experiment===
Zimbardo himself took part in the study, playing the role of "prison superintendent" who could mediate disputes between guards and prisoners. He instructed guards to find ways to dominate the prisoners, not with physical violence, but with other tactics, verging on torture, such as sleep deprivation and punishment with solitary confinement. Later in the experiment, as some guards became more aggressive, taking away prisoners' cots (so that they had to sleep on the floor), and forcing them to use buckets kept in their cells as toilets, and then refusing permission to empty the buckets, neither the other guards nor Zimbardo himself intervened. Knowing that their actions were observed but not rebuked, guards considered that they had implicit approval for such actions.<ref name="NewYorker">{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/the-real-lesson-of-the-stanford-prison-experiment |title=The Real Lesson of the Stanford Prison Experiment |last= Konnikova |first= Konnikova |work= New Yorker |quote=Occasionally, disputes between prisoner and guards got out of hand, violating an explicit injunction against physical force that both prisoners and guards had read prior to enrolling in the study. When the “superintendent” and “warden” overlooked these incidents, the message to the guards was clear: all is well; keep going as you are. The participants knew that an audience was watching, and so a lack of feedback could be read as tacit approval. And the sense of being watched may also have encouraged them to perform.  |date=June 12, 2015 |access-date=July 12, 2018}}</ref>

In later interviews, several guards told interviewers that they knew what Zimbardo wanted to have happen, and they did their best to make that happen.<ref name="Alum2011">{{Cite web |url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=40741 |title=The Menace Within |last=Ratnasar |first=Romesh |work=Stanford Alumni Magazine |quote=I felt that throughout the experiment, he knew what he wanted and then tried to shape the experiment—by how it was constructed, and how it played out—to fit the conclusion that he had already worked out. He wanted to be able to say that college students, people from middle-class backgrounds—people will turn on each other just because they're given a role and given power. |date=2011 |access-date=July 12, 2018}}</ref>

Less than two full days into the study, one inmate began suffering from depression, uncontrolled rage, crying and other mental dysfunctions. The prisoner was eventually released after screaming and acting in an unstable manner in front of the other inmates. This prisoner was replaced with one of the alternates.<ref name="Stanford Prison"/>

===Results===
By the end of the study, the guards had won complete control over all of their prisoners and were using their authority to its greatest extent.  One prisoner had even gone as far as to go on a hunger strike. When he refused to eat, the guards put him into solitary confinement for three hours (even though their own rules stated the limit that a prisoner could be in solitary confinement was only one hour). Instead of the other prisoners looking at this inmate as a hero and following along in his strike, they chanted together that he was a bad prisoner and a troublemaker. Prisoners and guards had rapidly adapted to their roles, stepping beyond the boundaries of what had been predicted and leading to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. Zimbardo himself started to give in to the roles of the situation. He had to be shown the reality of the study by [[Christina Maslach]], his girlfriend and future wife, who had just received her doctorate in psychology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html |title=The Stanford Prison Experiment: Still powerful after all these years (1/97) |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date=August 12, 1996 |access-date=November 7, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110802022901/http://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html |archive-date=August 2, 2011  }}</ref> Zimbardo reflects that the message from the study is that "situations can have a more powerful influence over our behaviour than most people appreciate, and few people recognize [that]."<ref name="Skepticality Episode 49">{{cite web|title=Skepticality Episode 49|url=http://www.skepticality.com/|publisher=[[Skeptic Magazine]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422123057/http://www.skepticality.com/|archive-date=April 22, 2012}}</ref>

At the end of the study, after all the prisoners had been released and the guards let go, everyone was brought back into the same room for evaluation and to be able to get their feelings out in the open towards one another. Ethical concerns surrounding the study often draw comparisons to the [[Milgram experiment]], which was conducted in 1961 at [[Yale University]] by [[Stanley Milgram]], Zimbardo's former high school friend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200009/emperor-the-edge|title=Emperor of the Edge|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=June 22, 2018}}</ref>

More recently, Thibault Le Texier of the University of Nice has examined the archives of the experiment, including videos, recordings, and Zimbardo's handwritten notes, and argued that "The guards knew what results the experiment was supposed to produce ... Far from reacting spontaneously to this pathogenic social environment, the guards were given clear instructions for how to create it ... The experimenters intervened directly in the experiment, either to give precise instructions, to recall the purposes of the experiment, or to set a general direction ...In order to get their full participation, Zimbardo intended to make the guards believe that they were his research assistants.".<ref>Thibault Le Texier, "Debunking the Stanford Prison Experiment."

More recently, an APA psychology article reviewed this work in detail <ref>Haslam, S. A., Reicher, S. D., & Van Bavel, J. J. (2019). Rethinking the nature of cruelty: The role of identity leadership in the Stanford Prison Experiment. American Psychologist, 74(7), 809–822. https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000443</ref> and concluded that Zimbardo encouraged the guards to act the way they did, so rather than this behavior appearing on its own, it was generated by Zimbardo.

===Prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib Prison===
{{Further|Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse}}
Zimbardo reflects on the dramatic visual similarities between the behaviour of the participants in the [[Stanford prison experiment]], and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib]]. He did not accept the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Richard Myers|General Myers]]' claim that the events were due to a few rogue soldiers and that it did not reflect on the military. Instead he looked at the situation the soldiers were in and considered the possibility that this situation might have induced the behavior that they displayed. He began with the assumption that the abusers were not "bad apples" and were in a situation like that of the Stanford prison study, where physically and psychologically healthy people were behaving sadistically and brutalising prisoners.<ref name="Skepticality Episode 49"/>

Zimbardo became absorbed in trying to understand who these people were, asking the question "are they inexplicable, can we not understand them". This led him to write the book ''The Lucifer Effect''.<ref name="Skepticality Episode 49"/>

==''The Lucifer Effect''==
{{main|The Lucifer Effect}}
''The Lucifer Effect'' was written in response to his findings in the Stanford Prison Experiment. Zimbardo believes that personality characteristics could play a role in how violent or submissive actions are manifested. In the book, Zimbardo says that humans cannot be defined as good or evil because we have the ability to act as both especially at the hand of the situation. Examples include the events that occurred at the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib Detention Center]], in which the defense team—including [[Gary Myers (lawyer)|Gary Myers]]—argued that it was not the prison guards and interrogators that were at fault for the physical and mental abuse of detainees but the Bush administration policies themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Panel blames Bush officials for detainee abuse|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28180540/#.Vo7gofkrKUk|website = msnbc.com|access-date = January 7, 2016|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306110205/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28180540/#.Vo7gofkrKUk|archive-date = March 6, 2016|df = mdy-all|date = December 11, 2008}}</ref> According to Zimbardo, "Good people can be induced, seduced, and initiated into behaving in evil ways. They can also be led to act in irrational, stupid, self-destructive, antisocial, and mindless ways when they are immersed in 'total situations' that impact human nature in ways that challenge our sense of the stability and consistency of individual personality, of character, and of morality."(Zimbardo, The Lucifer Effect, p.&nbsp;211)

In ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=September 19, 2007|volume=298|issue=11|pages=1338–1340}}</ref>

==Time==
In 2008, Zimbardo published his work with [[John Boyd (author)|John Boyd]] about the Time Perspective Theory and the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) in ''The Time Paradox: The New Psychology of Time That Will Change Your Life''. In 2009, he met Richard Sword and started collaborating to turn the Time Perspective Theory into a clinical therapy, beginning a four-year long pilot study and establishing time perspective therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sword |first1=Richard M. |last2=Sword |first2=Rosemary K.M. |last3=Brunskill |first3=Sarah R. |last4=Zimbardo |first4=Philip G. |year=2013 |title=Time Perspective Therapy: A new time-based metaphor therapy for PTSD |journal=Journal of Loss and Trauma |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=197–201 |doi=10.1080/15325024.2013.763632 |s2cid=54843165  |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ef79da7287b696512202ae137cbfb47006245b5d }}</ref> In 2009, Zimbardo did his Ted Talk  "The Psychology of Time"  about the Time Perspective Theory. According to this Ted Talk, there are six kinds of different Time Perspectives which are Past Positive TP (Time Perspective), Past Negative TP, Present Hedonism TP, Present Fatalism TP, Future Life Goal-Oriented TP and Future Transcendental TP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_prescribes_a_healthy_take_on_time?language=en#t-220228|title=The psychology of time|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|website=www.ted.com|access-date=April 21, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504221656/http://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_prescribes_a_healthy_take_on_time?language=en#t-220228|archive-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref>

In 2012, Zimbardo, Richard Sword, and his wife Rosemary authored a book called ''The Time Cure.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zimbardo |first1=Philip G. |last2=Sword |first2=Richard M. |last3=Sword |first3=Rosemary K.M. |year=2012 |title=The Time Cure: Overcoming PTSD with the New Psychology of Time Perspective Therapy |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-1118205679}}</ref>

Time Perspective therapy bears similarities to Pause Button Therapy, developed by psychotherapist Martin Shirran, whom Zimbardo corresponded with and met at the first International Time Perspective Conference at the [[University of Coimbra]], Portugal. Zimbardo wrote the foreword to the second edition of Shirran's book on the subject.<ref name="PBT">{{cite book | title=Pause Button Therapy | publisher=Hay House | author=Shirran, Martin | year=2012 | edition=2nd | isbn=978-1781800485}}</ref>

==Heroic Imagination Project==

As of 2014 Zimbardo is heading a movement for everyday heroism as the founder and director of the Heroic Imagination Project (HIP), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting heroism in everyday life.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/your-money/in-life-and-business-learning-to-be-ethical.html?_r=0|title=In Life and Business, Learning to Be Ethical|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 10, 2014|last=Tugend|first=Alina|access-date=January 21, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120141052/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/your-money/in-life-and-business-learning-to-be-ethical.html?_r=0|archive-date=January 20, 2014}}</ref> The project is currently collecting data from former American gang members and individuals with former ties to terrorism for comparison, in an attempt to better understand how individuals change violent behavior.

==Social intensity syndrome (SIS)==
In 2008, Zimbardo began working with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social intensity syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brunskill |first1=Sarah |last2=Zimbardo |first2=Philip |title=Social intensity syndrome phenomenon theory: Looking at the military as a sub culture |journal=Western Psychological Association, Reno, NV. |date=April 2013 |url=http://www.zimbardo.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Zimbardo-and-Brunskill-SIS-WPA-Factor-Analysis-presenation-4.23.2013-2.ppt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403202001/http://www.zimbardo.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Zimbardo-and-Brunskill-SIS-WPA-Factor-Analysis-presenation-4.23.2013-2.ppt |archive-date=April 3, 2015  }}</ref> Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013.

==Other endeavors==
[[File:Zimbardo.JPG|thumb|Zimbardo in Berlin, Germany in 2008]]
After the prison experiment, Zimbardo decided to look for ways he could use psychology to help people; this led to the founding of [[The Shyness Clinic]] in [[Menlo Park, California]], which treats [[shyness|shy behavior]] in adults and children. Zimbardo's research on shyness resulted in several bestselling books on the topic. Other subjects he has researched include [[mind control]] and [[cult]]ic behavior.<ref name="apamonitor">[http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm What messages are behind today's cults?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980502070642/http://csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm |date=May 2, 1998 }}, APA Monitor, May 1997</ref>

Zimbardo is the co-author of an introductory Psychology textbook entitled ''Psychology and Life'', which is used in many American undergraduate psychology courses. He also hosted a [[PBS]] TV series titled ''[[Discovering Psychology]]'' which is used in many [[Distance education|college telecourses]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learner.org/resources/series138.html/learner.org |title=Resource: Discovering Psychology: Updated Edition |publisher=Learner.org |access-date=November 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111091153/http://www.learner.org/resources/series138.html/learner.org |archive-date=January 11, 2012  }}</ref>

In 2004, Zimbardo testified for the defense in the [[court martial]] of Sgt. [[Ivan Frederick|Ivan "Chip" Frederick]], a guard at [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. He argued that Frederick's sentence should be lessened due to mitigating circumstances, explaining that few individuals can resist the powerful situational pressures of a prison, particularly without proper training and supervision. The judge apparently disregarded Zimbardo's testimony, and gave Frederick the maximum 8-year sentence. Zimbardo drew on the knowledge he gained from his participation in the Frederick case to write a new book entitled ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil'', about the connections between Abu Ghraib and the prison experiments.<ref>{{cite web |author=James Bone Rome |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article1576761.ece |title=The Times &#124; UK News, World News and Opinion |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |access-date=November 7, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809085216/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article1576761.ece |archive-date=August 9, 2011  }}</ref>
