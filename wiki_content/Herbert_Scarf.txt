'''Herbert Eli "Herb" Scarf''' (July 25, 1930 â€“ November 15, 2015) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematical economics|mathematical economist]] and [[Sterling Professor]] of [[Economics]] at [[Yale University]].

==Education and career==
Scarf was born in Philadelphia, the son of Jewish emigrants from Ukraine and Russia, Lene (Elkman) and Louis Scarf.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/business/herbert-scarf-an-economists-mathematician-dies-at-85.html|title=Herbert Scarf, an Economist's Mathematician, Dies at 85 (Published 2015)|first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=November 21, 2015|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> During his undergraduate work he finished in the top 10 of the 1950 [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition]], the major mathematics competition between universities across the United States and [[Canada]].  He received his PhD from Princeton in 1954, supervised by [[Salomon Bochner]].<ref>{{mathgenealogy|id=8119}}</ref>

==Contributions==
Among his notable works is a seminal paper in [[Cooperative game theory|cooperative game]] in which he showed sufficiency for a [[core (economics)]] in general balanced games.  Sufficiency and necessity had been previously shown by [[Lloyd Shapley]] for games where players were allowed to transfer utility between themselves freely.  Necessity is shown to be lost in the generalization.

==Recognition==
Scarf received the 1973 [[Frederick W. Lanchester Award]] for his contribution ''The Computation of Economic Equilibria'' with the collaboration of [[Terje Hansen]], which pioneered the use of numeric [[algorithm]]s to solve [[general equilibrium]] systems using [[Applied general equilibrium]] models.
He was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and was elected to the 2002 class of [[Fellow]]s of the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Fellows/Fellows-Alphabetical-List|title=Fellows: Alphabetical List|publisher=[[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]]|access-date=2019-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510220119/https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Fellows/Fellows-Alphabetical-List|archive-date=2019-05-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>
