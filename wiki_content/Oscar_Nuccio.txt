'''Oscar Nuccio''' ([[Brindisi]], 9 July 1931 â€“ [[Rieti]], 23 April 2004) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]] of [[Philosophy and economics|economic thought]]. He taught the [[history of economic thought]] in the departments of [[political science]] at the [[University of Pisa]], the [[University of Teramo]], and [[Sapienza University of Rome]], always as an [[associate professor]], as he was never awarded [[tenure]].

He penned over 200 academic publications between 1957 and 2008, focusing his studies on the birth of Italian economic thought. A practicing [[Roman Catholic]], he opposed [[Max Weber]]'s thesis, arguing that the root of [[market capitalism]] is not to be found in the [[Protestant Reformation]] but in the reaction by [[lawyer]]s and [[humanism|humanists]] to the framing of economic issues under [[scholasticism]]. This thesis is developed in particular in his 1999 work ''Goodbye Protestant Ethics''.

His most important work{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} was ''Italian Economic Thought'', a three-volume, seven-book work which covered the eleventh to the eighteenth centuries and won the Saint-Vincent Prize for the Economy in 1985. The work was summarized in the 700 pages of ''A History of Italian Economic Thought (As a Genesis of the Capitalist Spirit)'', published posthumously in 2008 by the [[LUISS]] University Press ([[Rome, Italy|Rome]]) and also available in English. In 1987 the study ''Economic [[Epistemology]]: the role of the concepts of '[[nature (philosophy)|nature]]' and '[[natural law]]' in the genesis of the economic'' won the "Seventy-fifth Prize" awarded by the ''Review of Economic Policy''. Nuccio followed that major work in 2000 with the study ''False and Commonplace in History: the equation of the [[Protestant ethic]] and the spirit of capitalism'', published by Alberti ([[Florence, Italy|Florence]]).

Nuccio also managed the anastatic reprinting of about thirty classics of the nineteenth century in the collection ''Italian Classic Writers of Political Economy'', or the "Custodi Collection" (in fifty volumes).
