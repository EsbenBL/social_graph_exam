'''Rosa Luxemburg''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈruʐa ˈluksɛmburk|lang|Róża Luksemburg wymowa (Rosa Luxemburg PL pronunciation).ogg}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʁoːza ˈlʊksəmbʊʁk|lang|De-Rosa Luxemburg.ogg}}; {{lang-pl|Róża Luksemburg}}; also ''Rozalia Luksenburg''; 5 March 1871 – 15 January 1919) was a Polish [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[economist]], [[Anti-war movement|anti-war activist]], [[philosopher]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]]. Successively, she was a member of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL), the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] (USPD) and the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD). Born and raised in an assimilated Jewish family in Poland, she became a German citizen in 1897.

After the SPD supported German involvement in [[World War I]] in 1915, Luxemburg and [[Karl Liebknecht]] co-founded the anti-war [[Spartacus League]] ({{lang|de|Spartakusbund}}) which eventually became the KPD. During the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]], she co-founded the newspaper {{lang|de|[[Die Rote Fahne]]}} (''The Red Flag''), the central organ of the Spartacist movement. Luxemburg considered the [[Spartacist uprising]] of January 1919 a blunder,<ref>Frederik Hetmann: ''Rosa Luxemburg. Ein Leben für die Freiheit'', p. 308.</ref> but supported the attempted overthrow of the government and rejected any attempt at a negotiated solution. [[Friedrich Ebert]]'s majority SPD government crushed the revolt and the {{lang|de|Spartakusbund}} by sending in the {{lang|de|[[Freikorps]]}}, government-sponsored paramilitary groups consisting mostly of World War I veterans. {{lang|de|Freikorps}} troops captured and [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] Luxemburg and Liebknecht during the rebellion.

Due to her pointed criticism of both the [[Leninism|Leninist]] and the more moderate [[social democracy|social democratic]] schools of [[socialism]], Luxemburg has had a somewhat ambivalent reception among scholars and theorists of the [[left-wing politics|political left]].<ref>[[Leszek Kołakowski]] ([1981], 2008), ''Main Currents of Marxism, Vol. 2: The Golden Age'', W. W. Norton & Company, Ch III: "Rosa Luxemburg and the Revolutionary Left".</ref> Nonetheless, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were extensively idolized as communist [[martyr]]s by the [[East Germany|East German]] communist government.<ref name="Verfassungsschutz">{{cite book|year=2008|title=Gedenken an Rosa Luxemburg und Karl Liebknecht – ein Traditionselement des deutschen Linksextremismus|url=https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/embed/broschuere-2008-04-luxemburg-liebknecht.pdf|location=Cologne|publisher=[[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]]|series=BfV-Themenreihe|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213010945/https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/embed/broschuere-2008-04-luxemburg-liebknecht.pdf|archive-date=13 December 2017}}</ref> The German [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] asserts that idolization of Luxemburg and Liebknecht is an important tradition of the German [[far-left]].<ref name="Verfassungsschutz"/> Despite her own Polish nationality and strong ties to Polish culture, opposition from the [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]] due to her stance against the creation of a bourgeois Polish state and later criticism from Stalinists have made her a controversial historical figure in Poland's present-day political discourse.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy „Książka i Prasa”|pages=7–29|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=9788365304599}}</ref><ref name="winkler" /><ref name="damian" />

==== Origins ====
Róża Luksemburg, actual birth name Rozalia Luksenburg, was born on 5 March 1871 in [[Zamość]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/l/u.htm#luxemburg|title=Glossary of People: L|website=Marxists.org|access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/suche/search?cmd=D&theSame=13056&name=Luxemburg+Rosa|title=Matrikeledition|website=Matrikel.uzh.ch|access-date=22 February 2018|archive-date=6 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206123408/http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/suche/search?cmd=D&theSame=13056&name=Luxemburg+Rosa|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Luxemburg family were [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] living in the [[congress Poland|Russian sector of Poland]], after the country was [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] almost a century earlier. She was the fifth and youngest child of Eliasz Luxemburg, a timber trader, and his wife, Line Löwenstein. Her grandfather Abraham supported the reformation of [[Orthodox Judaism]], whereas her father delivered weapons to Polish partisans and organised fundraisers for the [[January Uprising]].<ref name="damian" /> Luxemburg later stated that her father imparted an interest in [[liberalism|liberal]] ideas in her while her mother was religious and well-read with books kept at home.<ref name="Merrick">{{cite web|title=Rosa Luxemburg: A Socialist With a Human Face|last=Merrick|first=Beverly G.|work=Center for Digital Discourse and Culture at Virginia Tech University|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/Luxemburg.html|date=1998|access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref> The family moved to [[Warsaw]] in 1873.<ref>J.

==== Education and activism ====
In 1884, she enrolled at an all-girls' [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (secondary school) in Warsaw, which she attended until 1887.<ref name=RLlautHDK>{{cite web|title=Luxemburg, Rosa|publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=4740|author1=Weber, Hermann|author2-link=Andreas Herbst|author2=Herbst, Andreas|access-date=16 January 2019|author1-link=Hermann Weber}}</ref> The Second Women's Gymnasium was a school that only rarely accepted Polish applicants and acceptance of Jewish children was even more exceptional.

She began political activities by organizing a [[general strike]]; as a result, four of the Proletariat Party leaders were put to death and the party was disbanded, though the remaining members, including Luxemburg, kept meeting in secret. In 1887, she passed her [[Matura]] ([[secondary school]] graduation) examinations.

Róża became wanted by the tsarist police due to her activity in Proletariat; she hid in the countryside, working as private tutor at a [[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dworek]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy „Książka i Prasa”|pages=13–14|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=9788365304599}}</ref> In order to escape detention, she fled to [[Switzerland]] through the "green border" in 1889.<ref name="tych2">{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy „Książka i Prasa”|pages=14|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=9788365304599}}</ref> There she attended the [[University of Zurich]] (as did the socialists [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and [[Leo Jogiches]]), where she studied philosophy, history, politics, economics, and mathematics. She specialized in {{lang|de|Staatswissenschaft}} (political science), economic and [[stock exchange]] crises, and the [[Middle Ages]]. Her [[thesis|doctoral dissertation]] "The Industrial Development of [[Poland]]" ({{lang|de|Die Industrielle Entwicklung Polens}}) was officially presented in the spring of 1897 at the University of Zurich which awarded her a [[Doctor of law|Doctor of Law]] degree. Her dissertation was published by Duncker and Humblot in [[Leipzig]] in 1898. An oddity in Zurich, she was one of the first women in the world with a doctorate in economy<ref name="tych2" /> and the first Polish woman to achieve this.<ref name="winkler">{{cite web|url=https://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2019/06/24/roza-luksemburg-pierwsza-polka-z-doktoratem-z-ekonomii/|title=Róża Luksemburg.

She plunged immediately into the politics of international [[Marxism]], following in the footsteps of [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and [[Pavel Axelrod]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In 1893, with Leo Jogiches and [[Julian Marchlewski]] (alias Julius Karski), Luxemburg founded the newspaper {{lang|pl|Sprawa Robotnicza}} (''The Workers' Cause'') which opposed the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] policies of the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. Luxemburg believed that an independent Poland could arise and exist only through socialist revolutions in Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia. She maintained that the struggle should be against [[capitalism]], not just for Polish independence. Her position of denying a national right of [[self-determination]] provoked a philosophic disagreement with [[Vladimir Lenin]]. She and Leo Jogiches co-founded the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL) party, after merging Congress Poland's and Lithuania's social democratic organizations. Despite living in Germany for most of her adult life, Luxemburg was the principal theoretician of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP, later the SDKPiL) and led the party in a partnership with Jogiches, its principal organizer.<ref name="tych2" /> She remained sentimental towards Polish culture, her favourite poet was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], and she vehemently opposed the [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanisation of Poles]] in the [[Prussian Partition]]; in 1900 she published a brochure against this in [[Poznań]].<ref name="tych5">{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy „Książka i Prasa”|pages=18|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=9788365304599}}</ref> Earlier, in 1893, she also wrote against the Russification of Poles by the Russian Empire's absolutist government.<ref name="sprawaPL">{{cite journal|last1=Luksemburg|first1=Róża|date=July 1893|title=O wynaradawianiu (Z powodu dziesięciolecia rządów jen.-gub.

==== The 1905 revolution ====
After the [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907)|1905 revolution]] broke out, against the advice of her Polish and German comrades, Luksemburg left for [[Warsaw]]. If she were to be recognised then the tsarist authorities would imprison her, but the October/November political strike, part of the [[1905 Russian Revolution|upheaval in Russia]] with particularly active elements in Congress Poland, convinced Róża that at this time her place was in Warsaw instead of Berlin.<ref name="tych3">{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy „Książka i Prasa”|pages=15|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=9788365304599}}</ref> She arrived there on 30 December thanks to her German friend Anna Matschke's passport and met up with Jogiches, who had returned to Warsaw a month earlier also on a false passport; they lived together at a [[Pension (lodging)|pension]] at the corner of Jasna and Świętokrzyska streets, from where they wrote for the SDKPiL's illegally published paper {{lang|pl|Czerwony Sztandar}} (The Red Banner).<ref>{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy „Książka i Prasa”|pages=16|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=9788365304599}}</ref> Luksemburg was one of the first writers to notice the 1905 revolution's potential for democratisation within the Russian Empire. In the years 1905-1906 alone, she made in Polish and German over 100 articles, brochures, appeals, texts, and speeches about the revolution.<ref name="tych3" /> Although only the closest friends and comrades of Jogiches and Luxemburg knew of their return to the country, thanks to an agent placed by the tsarist authorities within the SDKPiL leadership the [[Okhrana]] came to arrest them on 4 March, 1906.<ref name="tych4">{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy „Książka i Prasa”|pages=17|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=9788365304599}}</ref>

They held her prisoner first at the [[ratusz]] jail, then at [[Pawiak prison]] and later at the Tenth Pavilion of the [[Warsaw Citadel]]. Luksemburg continued to write for the SDKPiL in secret behind prison walls; her works were smuggled out of the facility. <ref name="tych4" /> After two officers of the Okhrana were bribed by her relatives, a temporary release on bail was secured for her on 28 June, 1906 for health reasons until the court trial;<ref name="winkler" /> at the start of August, through [[St. Petersburg]] she left for [[Repino, Saint Petersburg|Kuokkala]], then part of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] (which was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire). From there, in the middle of September, she managed to secretly flee to Germany.<ref name="tych4" />

[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|224x224px|Luxemburg around 1895–1900]]
Luxemburg wanted to move to Germany to be at the centre of the party struggle, but she had no way of obtaining permission to remain there indefinitely. In April 1897 she married the son of an old friend, Gustav Lübeck, in order to gain a German citizenship. They never lived together and they formally divorced five years later.<ref>Waters, p. 12.</ref> She returned briefly to [[Paris]], then moved permanently to [[Berlin]] to begin her fight for [[Eduard Bernstein]]'s constitutional reform movement. Luxemburg hated the stifling conservatism of Berlin. She despised [[Prussia]]n men and resented what she saw as the grip of urban [[capitalism]] on [[social democracy]].<ref>Nettl, p. 383; Waters, p. 13.</ref> In the [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party of Germany]]'s women's section, she met [[Clara Zetkin]], of whom she made a lifelong friend. Between 1907 and his conscription in 1915, she was involved in a love affair with Clara's younger son, [[Kostja Zetkin]], to whom approximately 600 surviving letters (now mostly published) bear testimony.<ref name=hingfetscher>{{cite web|title=Selbst im Gefängnis Trost für andere|url=http://www.zeit.de/1984/41/selbst-im-gefaengnis-trost-fuer-andere/komplettansicht|date=5 October 1984| volume=41/1984| publisher=[[Die Zeit]] (online)|access-date=12 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=RLBriefelautStichting>{{cite web|title=Heute war mir Dein süßer Brief ein solcher Trost|url=https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Themen/Rosa_Luxemburg/rosa24-35.pdf#31|page=31|publisher=Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung Gesellschaftsanalyse und politische Bildung e. V., Berlin|access-date=12 September 2017}}</ref><ref>''Rosa Luxemburg: Gesammelte Briefe''. Vol. 2, 5 and 6.</ref> Luxemburg was a member of the uncompromising left-wing of the SPD. Their clear position was that the objectives of liberation for the industrial [[working class]] and all [[Minority group|minorities]] could be achieved by revolution only.

The recently published ''Letters of Rosa Luxemburg'' shed important light on her life in Germany.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/05/rosa-luxemburg-writer-activist-letters|title=The revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg|last=Rowbotham|first=Sheila|date=5 March 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 April 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> As [[Irene Gammel]] writes in a review of the English translation of the book in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'': "The three decades covered by the 230 letters in this collection provide the context for her major contributions as a political [[Activism|activist]], [[Socialism|socialist]] theorist and writer". Her reputation was tarnished by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s cynicism in ''Questions Concerning the History of Bolshevism''. In his rewriting of Russian events, he placed the blame for the theory of [[permanent revolution]] on Luxemburg's shoulders, with faint praise for her attacks on [[Karl Kautsky]] which she commenced in 1910.<ref>Waters, p. 20.</ref>

According to Gammel, "In her controversial tome of 1913, ''The Accumulation of Capital'', as well as through her work as a co-founder of the radical [[Spartacus League]], Luxemburg helped to shape Germany's young democracy by advancing an international, rather than a nationalist, outlook. This farsightedness partly explains her remarkable popularity as a socialist icon and its continued resonance in movies, novels and memorials dedicated to her life and oeuvre". Gammel also notes that for Luxemburg "the revolution was a way of life" and yet that the letters also challenge the stereotype of "Red Rosa" as a ruthless fighter.<ref>[http://www.ryerson.ca/mlc/inside224.html ''Revolutionary Rosa: The Letters of Rosa Luxemburg'']. Reviewed by Irene Gammel for the ''Globe and Mail''.</ref> However, ''The Accumulation of Capital'' sparked angry accusations from the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. In 1923, [[Ruth Fischer]] and [[Arkadi Maslow]] denounced the work as "errors", a derivative work of economic miscalculation known as "spontaneity".<ref>Waters, p. 19.</ref>

Luksemburg continued to identify as Polish and disliked living in Germany, which she saw as a political necessity, making various negative comments about contemporary German society in her private correspondence that was written in Polish; at the same time, she loved the works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and showed an appreciation for German literature. However, she also preferred Switzerland to Berlin and greatly missed being around the Polish language and culture.<ref name="rauba">{{cite web|url=http://www.1917.net.pl/node/6533|title=Ryszard Rauba: Wątek niemiecki w zapomnianej korespondencji Róży Luksemburg|last=Rauba|first=Ryszard|date=2011-09-28|website=1917.net|publisher=Instytut Politologii, Uniwersytet Zielonogórski|access-date=2021-07-25}}</ref><ref name="damian">{{cite web|url=https://histmag.org/Prawdziwe-oblicze-Rozy-Luksemburg-20512|title=Prawdziwe oblicze Róży Luksemburg?|last=Winczewski|first=Damian|date=2020-04-18|website=histmag.org|publisher=Histmag.org|access-date=2021-07-25}}</ref>

==== Before World War I ====
When Luxemburg moved to Germany in May 1898, she settled in Berlin. She was active there in the left- wing of the SPD in which she sharply defined the border between the views of her faction and the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism theory]] of [[Eduard Bernstein]]. She attacked him in her brochure ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'', released in September 1898. Luxemburg's rhetorical skill made her a leading spokesperson in denouncing the SPD's [[Reformism|reformist]] parliamentary course. She argued that the critical difference between [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour economics|labour]] could only be countered if the [[proletariat]] assumed [[Power (social and political)|power]] and effected [[revolution]]ary changes in [[methods of production]]. She wanted the revisionists ousted from the SPD. That did not occur, but Kautsky's leadership retained a Marxist influence on its programme.<ref>Weitz, Eric D. (1994). "'Rosa Luxemburg Belongs to Us!'". German Communism and the Luxemburg Legacy. ''Central European History'' (27: 1), pp. 27–64.</ref>

From 1900, Luxemburg published analyses of contemporary European socio-economic problems in newspapers. Foreseeing war, she vigorously attacked what she saw as German [[militarism]] and [[imperialism]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Kate Evans, ''Red Rosa: A Graphic Biography of Rosa Luxemburg'', New York, Verso, 2015</ref> Luxemburg wanted a general strike to rouse the workers to solidarity and prevent the coming war. However, the SPD leaders refused and she broke with Kautsky in 1910. Between 1904 and 1906, she was imprisoned for her political activities on three occasions.<ref>Weitz, Eric D. (1997). ''Creating German Communism, 1890–1990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.</ref> In 1907, she went to the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russian Social Democrats]]' Fifth Party Day in [[London]], where she met [[Vladimir Lenin]]. At the socialist [[Second International]] Congress in [[Stuttgart]], her [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] demanding that all European workers' parties should unite in attempting to stop the war was accepted.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Luxemburg taught Marxism and economics at the SPD's Berlin training centre. Her former student [[Friedrich Ebert]] became the SPD leader and later the [[Weimar Republic]]'s first President. In 1912, Luxemburg was the SPD representative at the European Socialists congresses.<ref name="ReferenceB">Paul Frölich, ''Rosa Luxemburg'', London: Haymarket Books, 2010</ref> With French socialist [[Jean Jaurès]], Luxemburg argued that European workers' parties should organize a general strike when war broke out. In 1913, she told a large meeting: "If they think we are going to lift the weapons of murder against our French and other brethren, then we shall shout: 'We will not do it!'" However, when nationalist crises in the [[Balkans]] erupted to violence and then war in 1914, there was no general strike and the SPD majority supported the war as did the [[French Section of the Workers' International|French Socialists]]. The [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] unanimously agreed to financing the war. The SPD voted in favour of that and agreed to a truce ({{lang|de|[[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]]}}) with the [[German Empire|Imperial]] government, promising to refrain from any strikes during the war. This led Luxemburg to contemplate suicide as the revisionism she had fought since 1899 had triumphed.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

In response, Luxemburg organised anti-war demonstrations in [[Frankfurt]], calling for [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] to [[Conscription|military conscription]] and the refusal to obey orders. On that account, she was imprisoned for a year for "inciting to disobedience against the authorities' law and order". Shortly after her death, her fame was alluded to by [[Grigory Zinoviev]] at the [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] on 18 January 1919 as he adjudged her astute assessment of [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]].<ref name="Waters, pp. 18–19">Waters, pp. 18–19.</ref>

==== During the war ====
In August 1914, Luxemburg, along with [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Franz Mehring]], founded the {{lang|de|Die Internationale}} ("The International") group which became the [[Spartacus League]] in January 1916. They wrote illegal anti-war pamphlets pseudonymously signed [[Spartacus]] after the slave-liberating [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[gladiator]] who opposed the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Luxemburg's pseudonym was Junius, after [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], founder of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Spartacus League vehemently rejected the [[Burgfriedenspolitik|SPD's support]] in [[Reichstag (German Empire)|the Reichstag]] for funding [[World War I|the war]], and sought to lead [[German Empire|Germany's]] proletariat towards an anti-war general strike. As a result, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were imprisoned in June 1916 for two and a half years. During imprisonment, Luxemburg was twice relocated, first to Posen (now [[Poznań]]), then to Breslau (now [[Wrocław]]).[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-14077-006, Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|right|266x266px|Luxemburg in 1915]]Friends smuggled out and illegally published her articles. Among them was ''The Russian Revolution'', criticising the [[Bolsheviks]], presciently warning of their dictatorship. Nonetheless, she continued to call for a "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", albeit not of the one party Bolshevik model. In that context, she wrote the words {{lang|de|"Freiheit ist immer die Freiheit des Andersdenkenden"}} ("Freedom is always the freedom of the one who thinks differently") and continues in the same chapter: "The public life of countries with limited freedom is so poverty-stricken, so miserable, so rigid, so unfruitful, precisely because, through the exclusion of democracy, it cuts off the living sources of all spiritual riches and progress".<ref>[https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/russian-revolution/ch06.htm "The Russian Revolution, Chapter 6: The Problem of Dictatorship"]. Marxists.org. Retrieved 5 February 2017.</ref> Another article written in April 1915 when in prison and published and distributed illegally in June 1916 originally under the pseudonym ''Junius'' was {{lang|de|Die Krise der Sozialdemokratie}} (''The Crisis of Social Democracy''), also known as the {{lang|de|Junius-Broschüre}} or ''The Junius Pamphlet''.<ref>[http://mlwerke.de/lu/luf.htm "Die Krise der Sozialdemokratie (Junius-Broschüre)"].</ref>

In 1917, the Spartacus League was affiliated with the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] (USPD), founded by [[Hugo Haase]] and made up of anti-war former SPD members. In November 1918, the USPD and the SPD assumed power in the new republic upon the abdication of Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. This followed the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] that began with the [[Kiel mutiny]], when workers' and soldiers' councils seized most of Germany to put an end to World War I and to the [[German Emperor|monarchy]]. The USPD and most of the SPD members supported the [[Workers' council|councils]] while the SPD leaders feared this could lead to a {{lang|de|Räterepublik}} (council republic) like the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905|Revolutions of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution|1917]].

Luxemburg was freed from prison in Breslau on 8 November 1918, three days before the [[armistice of 11 November 1918]]. One day later, Karl Liebknecht, who had also been freed from prison, proclaimed the Free Socialist Republic ({{lang|de|Freie Sozialistische Republik}}) in Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Live the Republic – 9 November 1918|last=von Hellfeld|first=Matthias|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|url=http://www.dw.de/long-live-the-republic-november-9-1918/a-4746952|date=16 November 2009|access-date=30 November 2014}}</ref> He and Luxemburg reorganised the Spartacus League and founded ''The Red Flag'' ({{lang|de|Die Rote Fahne}}) newspaper, demanding amnesty for all [[political prisoner]]s and the abolition of [[capital punishment]] in the essay ''Against Capital Punishment''.<ref name="Merrick"/> On 14 December 1918, they published the new programme of the Spartacus League.

From 29 to 31 December 1918, they took part in a joint congress of the League, independent socialists and the International Communists of Germany (IKD) that led to the foundation on 1 January 1919 of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) under the leadership of Liebknecht and Luxemburg. Luxemburg supported the new KPD's participation in the [[Weimar National Assembly]] that founded the [[Weimar Republic]], but she was out-voted and the KPD boycotted the elections.<ref>Luban, Ottokar (2017).

In January 1919, a second revolutionary wave swept Berlin. On New Year's Day, Luxemburg declared:<ref>Nettl, J. P. ''Rosa Luxemburg''. Vol. 1. p. 131. Waters, Mary-Alice Waters (ed.). ''Rosa Luxemburg Speaks''. p. 7.</ref>

<blockquote>Today we can seriously set about destroying capitalism once and for all. Nay, more; not merely are we today in a position to perform this task, nor merely is its performance a duty toward the proletariat, but our solution offers the only means of saving human society from destruction.</blockquote>

Like Liebknecht, Luxemburg supported the violent {{lang|de|putsch}} attempt.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=193}} ''The Red Flag'' encouraged the rebels to occupy the editorial offices of the liberal press and later, all positions of power.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=193}} On 8 January, Luxemburg's ''Red Flag'' printed a public statement by her, in which she called for revolutionary violence and no negotiations with the revolution's "mortal enemies", the [[Friedrich Ebert]]-[[Philipp Scheidemann]] government.{{sfn|Jones|2016|pp=193–194}}

The murders of Luxemburg and Liebknecht inspired a new wave of violence in Berlin and across Germany. Thousands of members of the KPD as well as other revolutionaries and civilians were killed. Finally, the People's Navy Division ({{lang|de|Volksmarinedivision}}) and workers' and soldiers' councils which had moved to the political left disbanded. Luxemburg was held in high regard by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], who recognised her revolutionary credentials at the [[Communist International|Third International]].<ref name="Waters, pp. 18–19"/>

The last part of the German Revolution saw many instances of armed violence and strikes throughout Germany. Significant strikes occurred in Berlin, the [[Bremen]] Soviet Republic, [[Saxony]], [[Saxe-Gotha]], [[Hamburg]], the [[Rhineland]]s and the [[Ruhr]] region. Last to strike was the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] which was suppressed on 2 May 1919.

More than four months after the murders of Luxemburg and Liebknecht, on 1 June 1919, Luxemburg's corpse was found and identified after an autopsy at the [[Charité]] hospital in Berlin.<ref name="Der Spiegel" /> Otto Runge was sentenced to two years' imprisonment (for "attempted manslaughter") and Lieutenant Vogel to four months (for failing to report a corpse).

In an interview with German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 1962 and again in his memoirs, Pabst maintained that two leaders of the SPD, Defence Minister [[Gustav Noske]] and Chancellor Friedrich Ebert, had approved of his actions. His account has been neither confirmed nor denied since the case has not been examined by parliament or the courts. In 1993, Gietinger's research on his access to the previously restricted papers of Pabst, held at the Federal Military Archives, found him as central to the planning of the murder of Luxemburg and the protection of those involved.{{sfn|Gietinger|2019}}

Luxemburg and Liebknecht were buried at the [[Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde|Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery]] in Berlin, where socialists and communists commemorate them yearly on the second Sunday of January.

== Thought ==
=== Revolutionary socialist democracy ===
[[File:Spdparteischule1907.jpg|thumb|260px|Luxemburg (leftward) among attendees at the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] party school in 1907]]
Luxemburg professed a commitment to democracy and the necessity of revolution. Luxemburg's idea of democracy which [[Stanley Aronowitz]] calls "''generalized'' democracy in an unarticulated form" represents Luxemburg's greatest break with "mainstream communism" since it effectively diminishes the role of the [[communist party]], but it is in fact very similar to the views of [[Karl Marx]] ("The [[emancipation]] of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves"). According to Aronowitz, the vagueness of Luxemburgian democracy is one reason for its initial difficulty in gaining widespread support. Luxemburg herself clarified her position on democracy in her writings regarding the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Early on, Luxemburg attacked undemocratic tendencies present in the Russian Revolution:<ref name="marxists.org">{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/russian-revolution/ch06.htm |title=The Russian Revolution |chapter=The Problem of Dictatorship |orig-date=1918 |publisher=Workers Age Publishers |location=New York |date=1940 |translator-first=Bertram |translator-last=Wolfe}}</ref>

{{quote|Without general elections, without unrestricted freedom of press and assembly, without a free struggle of opinion, life dies out in every public institution, becomes a mere semblance of life, in which only the bureaucracy remains as the active element. Public life gradually falls asleep, a few dozen party leaders of inexhaustible energy and boundless experience direct and rule. Among them, in reality only a dozen outstanding heads do the leading and an elite of the working class is invited from time to time to meetings where they are to applaud the speeches of the leaders, and to approve proposed resolutions unanimously{{spaced ndash}}at bottom, then, a clique affair{{spaced ndash}}a dictatorship, to be sure, not the dictatorship of the proletariat but only the dictatorship of a handful of politicians, that is a dictatorship in the bourgeois sense, in the sense of the rule of the [[Jacobins]] (the postponement of the Soviet Congress from three-month periods to six-month periods!) Yes, we can go even further: such conditions must inevitably cause a brutalization of public life: attempted assassinations, shooting of hostages, etc. (Lenin's speech on discipline and corruption.)}}

Luxemburg also insisted on socialist democracy:<ref name="marxists.org"/>

<blockquote>Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of one party – however numerous they may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently. Not because of any fanatical concept of "justice" but because all that is instructive, wholesome and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its effectiveness vanishes when "freedom" becomes a special privilege. [...] But socialist democracy is not something which begins only in the promised land after the foundations of socialist economy are created; it does not come as some sort of Christmas present for the worthy people who, in the interim, have loyally supported a handful of socialist dictators. Socialist democracy begins simultaneously with the beginnings of the destruction of class rule and of the construction of socialism.</blockquote>

=== Opposition to imperialist war and capitalism ===
While being critical of the politics of the [[Bolsheviks]], Luxemburg saw the behaviour of the social democratic [[Second International]] as a complete betrayal of socialism. As she saw it at the outset of the [[First World War]], the social democratic parties around the world betrayed the world's working class by supporting their own individual bourgeoisies in the war. This included her own [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), the majority of whose delegates in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] voted for war credits.

Luxemburg opposed the sending of the working class youth of each country to what she viewed as slaughter in a war over which of the national bourgeoisies would control world resources and markets. She broke from the Second International, viewing it as nothing more than an opportunist party that was doing administrative work for the capitalists. Along with [[Karl Liebknecht]], Luxemburg organized a strong movement in Germany with these views, but she was imprisoned and after her release killed for her work during the failed [[German Revolution]] of 1919, a revolution which the SPD violently opposed.

=== ''The Accumulation of Capital'' ===
[[File:Rosa Lux Berlin 1907.jpg|thumb|170px|Luxemburg at home with a book, 1907]]

''[[The Accumulation of Capital]]'' was the only work Luxemburg published on economics during her lifetime. In the polemic, she argued that capitalism needs to constantly expand into non-capitalist areas in order to access new supply sources, markets for surplus value and reservoirs of labor.<ref name="Reform or Revolution">{{cite book|author-last1=Luxemburg |author-first1=Rosa |contributor-last=Scott |contributor-first=Helen |contribution=Introduction to Rosa Luxemburg |title=The Essential Rosa Luxemburg: Reform or Revolution and The Mass Strike |url=https://archive.org/details/essentialrosalux00luxe |url-access=limited |date=2008 |publisher=Haymarket Books |location=Chicago |page=[https://archive.org/details/essentialrosalux00luxe/page/n14 18] |isbn=9781931859363}}</ref> According to Luxemburg, Marx had made an error in {{lang|de|[[Das Kapital]]}} in that the proletariat could not afford to buy the commodities they produced and by his own criteria it was impossible for capitalists to make a profit in a closed-capitalist system since the demand for commodities would be too low and therefore much of the value of commodities could not be transformed into money. According to Luxemburg, capitalists sought to realize profits through offloading surplus commodities onto non-capitalist economies, hence the phenomenon of imperialism as capitalist states sought to dominate weaker economies. However, this was leading to the destruction of non-capitalist economies as they were increasingly absorbed into the capitalist system. With the destruction of non-capitalist economies, there would be no more markets to offload surplus commodities onto and capitalism would break down.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism |author-last=Kołakowski |author-first=Leszek |author-link=Leszek Kołakowski |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |year=2008 |pages=407–415}}</ref>

''The Accumulation of Capital'' was harshly criticized by both Marxist and non-Marxist economists on the grounds that her logic was circular in proclaiming the impossibility of realizing profits in a close-capitalist system and that her underconsumptionist theory was too crude.<ref name=":0"/> Her conclusion that the limits of the capitalist system drive it to imperialism and war led Luxemburg to a lifetime of campaigning against militarism and colonialism.<ref name="Reform or Revolution"/>

=== ''Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation'' ===
[[File:LuxemburgSpeech.jpg|thumb|300px|Luxemburg addressing a crowd in 1907]]
The ''Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation'' was the central feature of Luxemburg's political philosophy, wherein [[Revolutionary spontaneity|spontaneity]] is a [[grassroots]] approach to organising a party-oriented [[Class conflict|class struggle]]. She argued that spontaneity and organisation, are not separable or separate activities, but different moments of one political process as one does not exist without the other. These beliefs arose from her view that class struggle evolves from an elementary, spontaneous state to a higher level:<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=In a Revolutionary Hour: What Next? |title=Collected Works |volume=1 |number=2 |pages=554}}</ref>

<blockquote>The working classes in every country only learn to fight in the course of their struggles. [...] Social democracy [...] is only the advance guard of the proletariat, a small piece of the total working masses; blood from their blood, and flesh from their flesh. Social democracy seeks and finds the ways, and particular slogans, of the workers' struggle only in the course of the development of this struggle, and gains directions for the way forward through this struggle alone.</blockquote>

Luxemburg did not hold spontaneism as an abstraction, but she developed the ''Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation'' under the influence of mass strikes in Europe, especially the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1905]].<ref>{{Britannica|352345}}</ref> Unlike the social democratic orthodoxy of the [[Second International]], she did not regard organisation as a product of scientific-theoretic insight to historical imperatives, but as product of the working classes' struggles:<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=The Political Leader of the German Working Classes |title=Collected Works |volume=2 |pages=280}}</ref>

<blockquote>Social democracy is simply the embodiment of the modern proletariat's class struggle, a struggle which is driven by a consciousness of its own historic consequences. The masses are in reality their own leaders, dialectically creating their own development process. The more that social democracy develops, grows, and becomes stronger, the more the enlightened masses of workers will take their own destinies, the leadership of their movement, and the determination of its direction into their own hands. And as the entire social democracy movement is only the conscious advance guard of the proletarian class movement, which in the words of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' represent in every single moment of the struggle the permanent interests of liberation and the partial group interests of the workforce {{lang|fr|vis à vis}} the interests of the movement as whole, so within the social democracy its leaders are the more powerful, the more influential, the more clearly and consciously they make themselves merely the mouthpiece of the will and striving of the enlightened masses, merely the agents of the objective laws of the class movement.</blockquote>

Luxemburg also argued:<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=The Politics of Mass Strikes and Unions |title=Collected Works |volume=2 |pages=465}}</ref>

<blockquote>The modern proletarian class does not carry out its struggle according to a plan set out in some book or theory; the modern workers' struggle is a part of history, a part of social progress, and in the middle of history, in the middle of progress, in the middle of the fight, we learn how we must fight. [...] That's exactly what is laudable about it, that's exactly why this colossal piece of culture, within the modern workers' movement, is epoch-defining: that the great masses of the working people first forge from their own consciousness, from their own belief, and even from their own understanding the weapons of their own liberation.</blockquote>

=== Criticism of the October Revolution ===
In an article published just before the [[October Revolution]], Luxemburg characterized the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917 as a "revolution of the proletariat" and said that the "[[Classical liberalism|liberal]] [[bourgeoisie]]" were pushed to movement by the display of "proletarian power". The task of the Russian proletariat, she said, was now to end the "imperialist" world war in addition to struggling against the "imperialist bourgeoisie". The world war made Russia ripe for a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]]. Therefore, "the German proletariat are also [...] posed a question of honour, and a very fateful question".<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=The Politics of Mass Strikes and Unions |title=Collected Works |volume=2 |pages=245}}</ref>

[[File:Rosa Luxemburg ND2.JPG|thumb|left|233x233px|A statue of Rosa Luxemburg in Berlin]]
In several works, including an essay written from jail and published posthumously by her last companion [[Paul Levi]] (publication of which precipitated his expulsion from the [[Communist International|Third International]]), titled ''The Russian Revolution'',<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution (Rosa Luxemburg, 1918) |publisher=Libcom.org |url=http://libcom.org/library/nationalities-question-in-the-russian-revolution-luxemburg |date=11 July 2006 |access-date=16 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115083740/http://libcom.org/library/nationalities-question-in-the-russian-revolution-luxemburg |archive-date=15 January 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> Luxemburg sharply criticized some [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] policies such as their suppression of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] in January 1918 and their policy of supporting the purported right of all national peoples to self-determination. According to Luxemburg, the Bolsheviks' strategic mistakes created tremendous dangers for the Revolution such as its bureaucratisation.

Her sharp criticism of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks was lessened insofar as she compared the errors of the Revolution and of the Bolsheviks with the "complete failure of the international proletariat".<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=On the Russian Revolution |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |pages=334}}</ref>

Bolshevik theorists such as [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] responded to this criticism by arguing that Luxemburg's notions were [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxist]] ones, but they could not be applied to Russia of 1917. They stated that the lessons of actual experience such as the confrontation with the bourgeois parties had forced them to revise the Marxian strategy. As part of this argument, it was pointed out that after Luxemburg herself got out of jail, she was also forced to confront the [[Weimar National Assembly|National Assembly]] in Germany, a step they compared with their own conflict with the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]].<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=Fragment on War, National Questions, and Revolution |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |pages=366}}</ref>

<blockquote>In this erupting of the social divide in the very lap of bourgeois society, in this international deepening and heightening of class antagonism lies the historical merit of Bolshevism, and with this feat – as always in large historic connections – the particular mistakes and errors of the Bolsheviks disappear without trace.</blockquote>

After the October Revolution, it becomes the "historic responsibility" of the German workers to carry out a revolution for themselves and thereby end the war.<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=The Historic Responsibility |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |pages=374}}</ref> When the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] also broke out, Luxemburg immediately began agitating for a social revolution:<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=The Beginning |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |pages=397}}</ref>

<blockquote>The abolition of the rule of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], the realization of a socialist social order – this, and nothing less, is the historical theme of the present revolution. It is a formidable undertaking, and one that will not be accomplished in the blink of an eye just by the issuing of a few decrees from above. Only through the conscious action of the working masses in city and country can it be brought to life, only through the people's highest intellectual maturity and inexhaustible idealism can it be brought safely through all storms and find its way to port.</blockquote>

In her later work ''The Russian Tragedy'', Luxemburg blamed many of the perceived failures of the Bolsheviks on the lack of a socialist uprising in Germany:

<blockquote>The Bolsheviks have certainly made a number of mistakes in their policies and are perhaps still making them – but where is the revolution in which no mistakes have been made! The notion of a revolutionary policy without mistakes, and moreover, in a totally unprecedented situation, is so absurd that it is worthy only of a German schoolmaster. If the so-called leaders of German socialism lose their so-called heads in such an unusual situation as a vote in the Reichstag, and if their hearts sink into their boots and they forget all the socialism they ever learned in situation in which the simple abc of socialism clearly pointed the way – could one expect a party caught up in a truly thorny situation, in which it would show the world new wonders, not to make mistakes?</blockquote>

Luxemburg further stated:<ref name=":1">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/09/11.htm |title=The Russian Tragedy |date=September 1918 |magazine=Spartacus |number=11 |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref>

<blockquote>The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the German, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history – that is squaring the circle. Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish – whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies.</blockquote>

Luxemburg also considered a socialist uprising in Germany to be the solution to the problems the Bolsheviks faced:<ref name=":1"/>

<blockquote>There is only one solution to the tragedy in which Russia is caught up: an uprising at the rear of German imperialism, the German mass rising, which can signal the international revolution to put an end to this genocide. At this fateful moment, preserving the honour of the Russian Revolution is identical with vindicating that of the German proletariat and of international socialists.</blockquote>

=== Epitaph on her death ===
Despite the criticism, Lenin praised Luxemburg after her death as an "eagle" of the working class:<ref>{{cite web|title=Ninety Years after the Murder of Rosa Luxemburg: Lessons of the Life of a Revolutionary |author-last=Larsen |author-first=Patrick |work=[[International Marxist Tendency]] |url=http://www.marxist.com/lessons-of-the-life-of-a-revolutionary.htm |date=15 January 2009 |access-date=18 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210929142612/http://www.marxist.com/lessons-of-the-life-of-a-revolutionary.htm |archive-date=29 September 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

<blockquote>But in spite of her mistakes she was{{snd}}and remains for us{{snd}}an eagle. And not only will communists all over the world cherish her memory, but her biography and her complete works (the publication of which the German communists are inordinately delaying, which can only be partly excused by the tremendous losses they are suffering in their severe struggle) will serve as useful manuals for training many generations of communists all over the world. 'Since 4 August 1914, German Social-Democracy has been a stinking corpse'{{snd}}this statement will make Rosa Luxemburg's name famous in the history of the international working class movement.</blockquote>

Trotsky also publicly mourned Luxemburg's death:<ref>{{cite web|title=Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg |author-last=Trotsky |author-first=Leon |author-link=Leon Trotsky |work=[[International Marxist Tendency]] |url=http://www.marxist.com/trotsky-on-karl-liebknecht-rosa-luxemburg.htm |date=15 January 1919 |access-date=18 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210929142604/http://www.marxist.com/trotsky-on-karl-liebknecht-rosa-luxemburg.htm |archive-date=29 September 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

<blockquote>We have suffered two heavy losses at once which merge into one enormous bereavement. There have been struck down from our ranks two leaders whose names will be for ever entered in the great book of the proletarian revolution: Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. They have perished. They have been killed. They are no longer with us!</blockquote>

In later years, Trotsky frequently defended Luxemburg, claiming that [[Joseph Stalin]] had vilified her.<ref name="Merrick"/> In the article ''Hands Off Rosa Luxemburg!'', Trotsky criticized Stalin for this despite what Trotsky perceived as Luxemburg's theoretical errors, writing: "Yes, Stalin has sufficient cause to hate Rosa Luxemburg. But all the more imperious therefore becomes our duty to shield Rosa's memory from Stalin's calumny that has been caught by the hired functionaries of both hemispheres, and to pass on this truly beautiful, heroic, and tragic image to the young generations of the proletariat in all its grandeur and inspirational force".<ref>{{cite web|title=Hands Off Rosa Luxemburg! |author-last=Trotsky |author-first=Leon |author-link=Leon Trotsky |work=[[International Marxist Tendency]] |url=http://www.marxist.com/hands-off-rosa-luxemburg-1932.htm |date=June 1932 |access-date=18 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210929143549/http://www.marxist.com/hands-off-rosa-luxemburg-1932.htm |archive-date=29 September 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

<blockquote>Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of a party – however numerous they may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is always the freedom of the one who thinks differently. Not because of the fanaticism of "justice", but rather because all that is instructive, wholesome, and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its effects cease to work when "freedom" becomes a privilege.</blockquote>
* The capitalist state of society is doubtless a historic necessity, but so also is the revolt of the working class against it – the revolt of its gravediggers. (April 1915)
* Without general elections, without unrestricted freedom of press and assembly, without a free struggle of opinion, life dies out in every public institution, becomes a mere semblance of life, in which only the bureaucracy remains as the active element.<ref name="marxists.org"/>

=== Last words: belief in revolution ===
Luxemburg's last known words written on the evening of her murder were about her belief in the masses and what she saw as the inevitability of a triumphant revolution:<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |author-link=Rosa Luxemburg |chapter=Order Reigns in Berlin |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |pages=536 |chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1919/01/14.htm}}</ref>

{{quote|The contradiction between the powerful, decisive, aggressive offensive of the Berlin masses on the one hand and the indecisive, half-hearted vacillation of the Berlin leadership on the other is the mark of this latest episode. The leadership failed. But a new leadership can and must be created by the masses and from the masses. The masses are the crucial factor. They are the rock on which the ultimate victory of the revolution will be built. The masses were up to the challenge, and out of this "defeat" they have forged a link in the chain of historic defeats, which is the pride and strength of international socialism. That is why future victories will spring from this "defeat."

"Order prevails in Berlin!" You foolish lackeys! Your "order" is built on sand. Tomorrow the revolution will "rise up again, clashing its weapons," and to your horror it will proclaim with trumpets blazing: I was, I am, I shall be!}}

The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] notes that idolization of Luxemburg and Liebnecht remains an important tradition of [[far-left]] extremism in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]].<ref name="Verfassungsschutz"/> During the [[Cold War]], Luxemburg and Liebnecht were idolized as martyrs by [[East Germany]]'s [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|ruling Party]] and continue to be idolized by it's successor party: [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].<ref name="Verfassungsschutz"/>

In the former East Germany and East Berlin, various places were named for Luxemburg by the East German communist party. These include the [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz]] and a [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn station]] which were located in [[East Berlin]] during the [[Cold War]]. 

An engraving on the nearby pavement reads "Ich war, ich bin, ich werde sein" ("I was, I am, I will be"). The [[Volksbühne]] (People's Theatre) is also on Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz.

Following the 1989 [[Peaceful Revolution]] and [[German reunification]], CDU delegates on the Berlin city council recommended renaming all streets and squares honoring [[Karl Marx]], [[August Bebel]], Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and [[Clara Zetkin]]. In a rare moment of agreement, both [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]] and SPD delegates balked at this and the battle became so heated that an independent commission was appointed to advise on the question. The commission ultimately recommended the compromise, "that Communists who had died too soon to help bring Weimar down, or the GDR up, should not be purged". For this reason, both streets and squares in the former East Berlin continue to bear Rosa Luxemburg's name.<ref> David Clay Large (2000), ''Berlin'', Basic Books. Pages 560-561.</ref>

[[File:L-L Demo 2016.jpg|thumb|A scene from the 2016 Liebknecht-Luxemburg Demonstration in Berlin, held each year in January to honor the murdered communists]]
[[Dresden]] has a street and streetcar stop named after Luxemburg. The names remained unchanged after the [[German reunification]].

During the [[Polish People's Republic]] in [[Warsaw]]'s [[Wola]] district, a manufacturing facility of electric lamps was established and named after Luxemburg.

In 1919, [[Bertolt Brecht]] wrote the poetic memorial ''Epitaph'' honouring Luxemburg and [[Kurt Weill]] set it to music in ''The Berlin Requiem'' in 1928:

<blockquote><poem>Red Rosa now has vanished too,
And where she lies is hid from view.
She told the poor what life's about,
And so the rich have rubbed her out.
May she rest in peace.</poem></blockquote>

The British [[New Left]] historian [[Isaac Deutscher]] wrote of Luxemburg: "In her assassination [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] Germany celebrated its last triumph and Nazi Germany its first".

Opponents of the far-left had a very different interpretation of Luxemburg's murder. [[White émigré|Anti-communist Russian refugees]] occasionally expressed envy for the success of the SPD and the {{lang|de|Freikorps}} in defeating the Spartacus Uprising, which was seen as a German equivalent to the [[Bolshevik Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} In a 1922 conversation with [[Harry Graf Kessler|Count Harry Kessler]], one such refugee lamented:<ref>[[Harry Graf Kessler|Kessler, Harry Graf]] (1990).

<blockquote>Infamous, that fifteen thousand Russian officers should have let themselves be [[Red Terror|slaughtered by the Revolution]] without raising a hand in self-defense! Why didn't they act like the Germans, who killed Rosa Luxemburg in such a way that not even a smell of her has remained?</blockquote>

There is also a monument in [[Luxembourg]] for "Lady Rosa" created by [[Sanja Iveković]].

In [[Barcelona]], there are terraced gardens named in her honor. In [[Madrid]], there is a street and several public schools and associations named after Luxemburg. Other Spanish cities including [[Gijón]], [[Getafe]] or [[Arganda del Rey]] have streets named after her.

At the edge of the [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]] on the {{lang|de|Katharina-Heinroth-Ufer}} which runs between the southern bank of the [[Landwehr Canal]] and the bordering {{lang|de|Zoologischer Garten}} (Zoological Garden), a memorial has been installed by a private initiative. On the memorial, the name Rosa Luxemburg appears in raised capital letters, marking the spot where her body was thrown into the canal by {{lang|de|Freikorps}} troops.

The famous Monument to Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, originally named Monument to the November Revolution ({{lang|de|Revolutionsdenkmal}}) which was designed by pioneering modernist and later [[Bauhaus]] director [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and built in 1926 in Berlin-Lichtenberg<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/MiesvanderRohe.Architecture/photos/?tab=album&album_id=61452845378|title=Mies van der Rohe|website=Facebook.com|access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref> and destroyed in 1935. The memorial took the form of a suprematist composition of brick masses. Van der Rohe said: "As most of these people [Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and other fallen heroes of the Revolution] were shot in front of a brick wall, a brick wall would be what I would build as a monument". The commission came about through the offices of [[Eduard Fuchs]], who showed a proposal featuring [[Doric order|Doric]] columns and medallions of Liebknecht and Luxemburg, prompting Mies' laughter and the comment "That would be a good monument for a banker". The monument was destroyed by the Nazis after they took power.

Two small international networks based on her political thought characterize themselves as Luxemburgists, namely the [http://democom.alice.red/communistdemocracy.htm Communist Democracy (Luxemburgist)] founded in 2005 and the [http://luxemburgism.org/ International Luxemburgist Network] founded in 2008. [[Feminists]] and Trotskyists as well as leftists in Germany especially show interest in Luxemburg's ideas. Distinguished modern Marxist thinkers such as [[Ernest Mandel]], who has even been characterised as Luxemburgist, have seen Luxemburg's thought as a corrective to revolutionary theory.<ref>Achacar, Gilbert.

=== Annual demonstration ===
In the city of Berlin a {{lang|de|Liebknecht-Luxemburg Demonstration}}, shortened to {{lang|de|LL-Demo}}, is organized annually in the month of January around the date of their death. This demonstration takes place on the second weekend of the month in [[Friedrichshain|Berlin-Friedrichshain]], starting near the [[Frankfurter Tor]] to the central cemetery [[Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde|Friedrichsfelde]], also known as the {{lang|de|Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten}} (Socialist Memorial).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xhain.info/termine/liebknecht-luxemburg-demo.htm|title=Liebknecht-Luxemburg-Demonstration|first=Rene|last=Meintz|date=13 January 2019|website=Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg-Portal}}</ref> In [[East Germany]], the event was widely considered to be a mere show for [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] politicians and celebrities, which was broadcast live on state television.<ref>[https://www.jugendopposition.de/themen/145392/luxemburg-liebknecht-demonstration "Luxemburg-Liebknecht-Demonstration"]. Jugendopposition in der DDR.</ref>

During the [[Peaceful Revolution]], the annual parade in [[East Berlin]] honoring the deaths of Liebknecht and Luxemburg was used by East German [[dissidents]] as part of their campaign, "to raise their unwelcome demands at embarrassing moments for the regime". On January 17, 1988, as Premier [[Erich Honecker]] was reviewing the parade, a group of dissidents broke through the ranks of the [[Free German Youth]] and unfurled banners bearing Rosa Luxemburg's dictum, "True freedom is always the freedom of the non-conformists!" Viewers of the parade were then subjected to the deeply ironic sight of [[Stasi]] agents savagely beating up and arresting everyone who brandished the slogan.<ref> David Clay Large (2000), ''Berlin'', Basic Books. Page 520.</ref>

In January 2019, the German left-wing parties commemorated at the occasion of this demonstration the 100th anniversary of the summary execution of Luxemburg and Liebknecht.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20190113/gloomy-german-left-remembers-murdered-rosa-luxemburg|title=Gloomy German left remembers murdered Rosa Luxemburg|date=13 January 2019|website=www.thelocal.de}}</ref><ref>[https://xenagoguevicene.com/2019/01/13/berlin-15000-rally-to-remember-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-assassination-of-communists-rosa-luxemburg-and-karl-leibnicht-13-jan-2019/ "Berlin: 15,000 Rally to Remember the 100th Anniversary of the Assassination Of Communists Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht"]. 13 January 2019.

== Body identification controversy ==
[[File:Grab liebknecht luxemburg.jpg|thumb|1919 photo of the graves of Luxemburg and [[Karl Liebknecht]]]]
[[File:Berlin Friedrichsfelde Zentralfriedhof, Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten (Rondell) - Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|Grave of Rosa Luxemburg in Berlin]]
On 29 May 2009, ''Spiegel online'', the internet branch of the news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', reported the recently considered possibility that someone else's remains had mistakenly been identified as Luxemburg's and buried as hers.<ref name="Der Spiegel"/>

The [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] Michael Tsokos, head of the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences at the Berlin [[Charité]], discovered a preserved corpse lacking head, feet, or hands in the cellar of the Charité's medical history museum. He found the corpse's autopsy report suspicious and decided to perform a [[CT scan]] on the remains. The body showed signs of having been waterlogged at some point and the scans showed that it was the body of a woman of 40–50 years of age who suffered from [[osteoarthritis]] and had legs of differing length. At the time of her murder, Luxemburg was 47 years old and suffering from a congenital dislocation of the hip that caused her legs to have different lengths. A laboratory in [[Kiel]] also tested the corpse using [[radiocarbon dating]] techniques and confirmed that it dated from the same period as Luxemburg's murder.

The original [[autopsy]], performed on 13 June 1919 on the body that was eventually buried at [[Friedrichsfelde]], showed certain inconsistencies that supported Tsokos' hypothesis. The autopsy explicitly noted an absence of hip damage and stated that there was no evidence that the legs were of different lengths. Additionally, the autopsy showed no traces on the upper skull of the two blows by rifle butt inflicted upon Luxemburg. Finally, while the 1919 examiners noted a hole in the corpse's head between left eye and ear, they did not find an exit wound or the presence of a bullet within the skull.

Assistant pathologist Paul Fraenckel appeared to doubt at the time that the corpse he had examined was Luxemburg's and in a signed addendum distanced himself from his colleague's conclusions. This addendum and the inconsistencies between the autopsy report and the known facts persuaded Tsokos to examine the remains more closely. According to eyewitnesses, when Luxemburg's body was thrown into the canal, weights were wired to her ankles and wrists. These could have slowly severed her extremities in the months her corpse spent in the water which would explain the missing hands and feet issue.<ref name="Der Spiegel"/>

Tsokos realized that [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]] was the best way to confirm or deny the identity of the body as Luxemburg's. His team had initially hoped to find traces of the [[DNA]] on old postage stamps that Luxemburg had licked, but it transpired that Luxemburg had never done this, preferring to moisten stamps with a damp cloth. The examiners decided to look for a surviving blood relative and in July 2009 the German Sunday newspaper ''[[Bild|Bild am Sonntag]]'' reported that a great-niece of Luxemburg had been located{{snd}}a 79-year-old woman named Irene Borde. She donated strands of her hair for DNA comparison.<ref>{{cite news|title=DNA of Great-Niece May Help Identify Headless Corpse|publisher=SpiegelOnline|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,637385,00.html|date=21 July 2009|access-date=21 July 2009|newspaper=Spiegel Online}}</ref>

In December 2009, Berlin authorities seized the corpse to perform an autopsy before burying it in Luxemburg's grave.<ref>{{cite news|title=Berlin Authorities Seize Corpse for Pre-Burial Autopsy|publisher=SpiegelOnline|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,667606,00.html|date=17 December 2009|access-date=17 December 2009|newspaper=Spiegel Online}}</ref> The Berlin Public Prosecutor's office announced in late December 2009 that while there were indications that the corpse was Luxemburg's, there was not enough evidence to provide conclusive proof. In particular, DNA extracted from the hair of Luxemburg's niece did not match that belonging to the cadaver. Tsokos had earlier said that the chances of a match were only 40%. The remains were to be buried at an undisclosed location while testing was to continue on tissue samples.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rosa Luxemburg "floater" released for burial after 90 years|publisher=Salon.com|work=Lost in Berlin|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/lost_in_berlin/2009/12/30/rosa_luxemburg_floater_released_for_burial_after_90_years|date=30 December 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111173814/http://open.salon.com/blog/lost_in_berlin/2009/12/30/rosa_luxemburg_floater_released_for_burial_after_90_years|archive-date=11 January 2012}}</ref>
