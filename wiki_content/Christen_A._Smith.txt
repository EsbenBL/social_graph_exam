== ''Afro-Paradise'' ==
In 2016, Smith published a book through [[University of Illinois Press]] titled ''Afro-Paradise: Blackness, Violence, and Performance in Brazil''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Christen A.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935128097|title=Afro-Paradise: Blackness, Violence, and Performance in Brazil.|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2016|isbn=978-0-252-09809-3|location=Urbana|oclc=935128097}}</ref> She coined the term ''Afro-Paradise'' to refer to a society that celebrates Black bodies and consumes Black culture while also sapping Black labor and killing Black people. The term was inspired by time she spent in [[Salvador, Bahia]], with Smith explaining "The state terrorizes its own citizens in order to create the fantasy of Bahia as a celebratory, romantic Black paradise: Afro-Paradise."<ref name=":1" /> Bahia is the focus of the book, which is made up of five chapters.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Berry|first=Maya|author-link=Maya Berry|title=Afro-Paradise: Blackness, Violence, and Performance in Brazil by Christen Smith|url=https://hemisphericinstitute.org/en/emisferica-13-1-states-of-devotion/13-1-book-reviews/afro-paradise-blackness-violence-and-performance-in-brazil-by-christen-smith.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-19|website=[[Hemispheric Institute]]}}</ref>

The book was positively reviewed in the ''[[Luso-Brazilian Review]]'', which suggested that the reader also research the history of Brazil as it relates to the conflict outlined in ''Afro-Paradise''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosa|first=Cristina F.|date=2017|title=Afro-Paradise: Blackness, Violence, and Performance in Brazil by Christen A.
