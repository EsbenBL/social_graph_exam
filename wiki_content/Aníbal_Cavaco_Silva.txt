'''Aníbal António Cavaco Silva''', [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]], [[Order of Liberty|GColL]] ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈniβɐɫ ɐ̃ˈtɔni.u kɐˈvaku ˈsiɫvɐ}}; born 15 July 1939) is a Portuguese [[economist]] who served as the 19th [[President of Portugal]], in office from 9 March 2006 to 9 March 2016. He had been previously [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] from 6 November 1985 to 28 October 1995. His 10-year tenure was the longest of any prime minister since [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], and he was the first Portuguese prime minister to win an absolute parliamentary majority under the current constitutional system. He is best known for leading Portugal into the [[European Union]].

==Early life and career==
Aníbal António Cavaco Silva was born in [[Boliqueime]], [[Loulé]], [[Algarve]].

Cavaco Silva was initially an undistinguished student. As a 13-year-old, he flunked at the 3rd grade of the Commercial School, and his grandfather put him working on the farm as a punishment.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://diario.iol.pt/noticia.html?id=637824&div_id=4071 Perfil de Cavaco Silva]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[iol.pt]]</ref> After returning to school, Cavaco Silva went on to become an accomplished student. Cavaco Silva then went to [[Lisbon]], where he took a [[vocational education]] course in accounting from "Instituto Comercial de Lisboa" (''Instituto Superior de Contabilidade e Administração de Lisboa'' (ISCAL), today) in 1959. In parallel, he was admitted for [[university]] education at the ''Instituto Superior de Ciências Económicas e Financeiras de Lisboa (ISCEF)'' of the [[Technical University of Lisbon]] (UTL) (currently the ''Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão (ISEG)'' of the Technical University of Lisbon), and obtained in 1963, with distinction, a degree in [[economics]] and [[finance]] (he scored a mark of 16 out of 20). While studying in Lisbon, Cavaco Silva was an athlete of [[Centro Desportivo Universitário de Lisboa|CDUL]] [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] department from 1958 to 1963. Between 1963 and 1964, he was drafted into the Portuguese Army Artillery for compulsory 11 month military service, serving in a battalion in [[Lourenco Marques]] in [[Portuguese Mozambique]]<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.record.xl.pt/interior.aspx?content_id=258860 Ás nas barreiras], [[Record (Portuguese newspaper)|Record]]</ref>

In 1964 he married Maria Alves da Silva, a lecturer in [[Germanic philology|Germanic]] [[philology]] at the [[University of Lisbon]], with whom he has two children (Bruno Alves and Patrícia Maria). His teaching career began in 1966 as assistant to ISCEF, but two years later Cavaco Silva went to the [[University of York]], in the [[United Kingdom]], where, in 1973, he was awarded a [[doctorate]] in [[economics]]. His thesis at York was a defense of (then popular) [[Keynesian economics]]<ref>[http://puraeconomia.blogspot.com/2004/11/o-esquizofrnico-livro-do-professor.html O esquizofrénico livro do Professor Cavaco Silva, Pura Economia]</ref> (Neo-Keynesianism would influence his thought as Prime Minister later and he still self-identifies as a Neo-Keynesian).

Returning to Portugal, he took up a post as assistant professor in ISCEF (1974), professor at the [[Catholic University of Portugal]] (1975), extraordinary professor at the [[New University of Lisbon]] (1979) and finally director of the Office of Studies of the [[Bank of Portugal]].<ref>[http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultnot/lusa/2006/01/22/ult611u70070.jhtm Cavaco Silva – Perfil], source [[Agência Lusa]]; website [[Universo Online|UOL]] (January 2006)</ref>

He only became active in politics after the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 25 April 1974, later that year joining the then PPD, a political party headed by [[Francisco Sá Carneiro]]. Cavaco Silva, was appointed Minister of Finance by [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] Francisco Sá Carneiro in 1980. He gained a reputation as an economic liberal, gradually dismantling regulations inhibiting free enterprise. He refused to serve in the [[Central Block]] coalition of [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialists]] and [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] (PSD) that governed from 1983 to 1985, and his election to the leadership of the PSD on 2 June 1985, portended the end of the coalition.

Professor Cavaco Silva has published several academic works in economics, including in subfields like [[monetary policy]] and [[monetary union]]s.

Silva received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 2009 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/ppr/docs/network-summer-2009.pdf |title=Honorary Graduates 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816050207/http://www.hw.ac.uk/ppr/docs/network-summer-2009.pdf |archive-date=2009-08-16 }}</ref>

==Political career in Portugal==

===Prime Minister===
The [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|1985 legislative election]] was complicated by the arrival of a new political party, the [[Democratic Renewal Party (Portugal)|Democratic Renewal Party]] (PRD), which had been formed by the supporters of the [[List of Presidents of Portugal|President]], [[António Ramalho Eanes]]. In the 250-member [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], the nation's legislature, the PRD won 45 seats – at the expense of every party except Cavaco Silva's PSD.  Despite winning less than 30 percent of the popular vote, the PSD was the only traditional political party not to suffer substantial losses. Its 88 seats, in fact, represented a gain of 13 over the previous election. Accordingly, Cavaco Silva became Prime Minister on 6 November 1985.

Tax cuts and economic deregulation and the arrival of EU funds spurred several years of uninterrupted economic growth, which increased Cavaco Silva's popularity. He was hampered, however, by heading a minority government. On most issues, his Social Democrats could rely on the 22 votes of the [[Democratic and Social Centre – People's Party|Social and Democratic Center Party]] (CDS), but the two parties' combined 110 votes fell 16 short of a parliamentary majority.  The [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialists]] and [[Portuguese Communist Party|Communists]] held 57 and 38 seats respectively; Cavaco Silva could govern if the 45 members of the PRD, who held the balance of power, abstained, as they frequently did.

[[File:Reagan and Cavaco Silva in the Oval Office 1988-02-24.png|thumb|Prime minister Cavaco Silva meeting with U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]], 1988]]
In 1987, however, the PRD withdrew its tacit support, and a parliamentary vote of no confidence forced President [[Mário Soares]] to call [[1987 Portuguese legislative election|an early election]]. The results of the election stunned even the most optimistic of Cavaco Silva's supporters. His Social Democrats captured 50.2 percent of the popular vote and 148 of the 250 seats in the legislature. Far behind were the Socialists, with only 60 seats, and the Communists, with 31. The CDS and the PRD were virtually wiped out, left with only four and seven seats, respectively.  This was the first time since the 1974 revolution that a single party had won an outright majority in the national parliament.<ref>David B. Goldey, "The Portuguese elections of 1987 and 1991 and the presidential election of 1991." ''Electoral Studies'' 11.2 (1992): 171-176.</ref> At the time, it was also the largest majority that a Portuguese party had ever won in a free election.

Although the occurrence of economic growth and a [[public debt]] relatively well-contained as a result of the number of civil servants was increased from 485,368 in 1988 to 509,732 in 1991, which was a much lower increase than that which took place in the following years until 2011 marked by irrational and unsustainable State employment, from 1988 to 1993, during the government cabinets led by  Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese economy was radically changed. As a result, there was a sharp and rapid decrease in the output of [[tradable goods]] and a rise of the importance of the [[non-tradable goods]] sector in the Portuguese economy.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Economia/Interior.aspx?content_id=2965582 Maior queda nos bens e serviços transaccionáveis aconteceu entre 1988 e 1993], [[TSF (radio)|TSF]] (December 27, 2012)</ref>

The [[1991 Portuguese legislative election|1991 election]] was another triumph for Cavaco Silva; it yielded a majority even larger (50.6 percent) than the one of four years earlier. However, the 1993 European economic crisis, sparking a high unemployment rate, and the country's mistrust of [[Cavaco Silva's Cabinets (1985-95)|long-spanning governments]], eroded his popularity. He decided not to contest the [[1995 Portuguese legislative election|1995 election]], and the PSD, lacking a leader of his stature, lost 48 seats and the election.

===Post-premiership===
Cavaco Silva contested the [[1996 Portuguese presidential election|1996 presidential election]], but was defeated by the Mayor of [[Lisbon]], [[Jorge Sampaio]], the Socialist candidate. Retiring from politics, he served for several years as an advisor to the board of the [[Banco de Portugal]] (Bank of Portugal), but retired from this position in 2004. He then became a full professor at the School of Economics and Management of the [[Catholic University of Portugal]], where he taught the undergraduate and MBA programs.

He declined to support [[Pedro Santana Lopes]], whom he branded as a mediocre politician, in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 parliamentary election]], despite pressure from within his party.

He is a member of the [[Club of Madrid]]<ref>{{in lang|en}} [http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid is an independent organization dedicated to strengthening democracy around the world by drawing on the unique experience and resources of its Members – 66 democratic former heads of state and government]</ref> and an honorary member of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140831043155/http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/  International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation].

===President of the Republic===
[[File:Cavaco Silva e Lula 04072007.jpg|thumb|270px|left|President Cavaco Silva meets the [[President of Brazil]], [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]], in 2007.]]
On 20 October 2005, Cavaco Silva announced his candidacy for the 2006 presidential election. He was elected President of the Republic on [[2006 Portuguese presidential election|22 January 2006]] with 50.6% of votes cast, avoiding a run-off. He is the first elected [[center-right]] President in Portugal since 1974.  He is also the second former Prime Minister to be elected President, following in the footsteps of [[Mário Soares]].

He was sworn-in on 9 March 2006. He is also the President of the [[Portuguese Council of State]].

Cavaco Silva's term was initially marked by a mutual understanding with the government led by Socialist [[José Sócrates]], which he referred to as "strategic co-operation". He also avidly encouraged the suppression of partisan differences between the political parties in parliament, as a means of working towards the greater national good, despite the absolute majority held by the Socialist Party. This led to several controversies, with some branding Cavaco Silva, a practicing Roman Catholic and a self-described believer in [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima apparitions]], as a traitor to the center-right and to some of his own personal beliefs. Nevertheless, this seems to have been a misconception with respect to his presidency. In effect, he resorted to his veto power more than Mário Soares, who as a President was largely seen as too conflicting with the Government, in the latter's first term.

The most controversial moment of his presidency was when the Assembly of the Republic passed a bill for the holding of a pre-legislative referendum on the legalization of abortion in Portugal without any restrictions in the 10 first weeks of pregnancy. After the parliamentary approval of the bill summoning the referendum, Cavaco Silva referred the matter to the Portuguese Constitutional Court, which declared both the proposed legalization and the referendum constitutional by a narrow 7-6 margin. Cavaco Silva, who could still have vetoed the referendum bill, decided to sign it into law despite pressure from some pro-life sectors, and thus allowed the referendum. The majority of the Portuguese electorate abstained from the referendum, but the vote for legalization prevailed among those who chose to cast their ballot.

Cavaco Silva was reelected President of Portugal on 23 January 2011 with 52,92% of the vote, and he took office for his second five-year term on 9 March 2011.

===2015 constitutional crisis===
At the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|general election on 4 October 2015]] to the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], the unicameral Portuguese parliament, the right-wing government of Prime Minister [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] lost its majority, with center-left and far-left opposition parties gaining more than half of the seats. As Passos Coelho's own [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] remained the largest in parliament, and still had the support of the much smaller [[CDS – People's Party]], Cavaco Silva allowed Passos Coelho to continue as Prime Minister, giving him the first chance to form a new government. Passos Coelho was unable to find any new partners and was widely expected to stand down, but on 22 October Cavaco Silva invited him to form a new government, even if it were a minority government. On 24 October Cavaco Silva explained his thinking:<ref name=dtel>Eurozone crosses Rubicon as Portugal's anti-euro Left banned from power] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' dated 24 October 2015, online at telegraph.co.uk, accessed 25 October 2015</ref>

{{cquote|In 40 years of democracy, no government in Portugal has ever depended on the support of anti-European forces, that is to say forces that campaigned to abrogate the Lisbon Treaty, the Fiscal Compact, the Growth and Stability Pact, as well as to dismantle monetary union and take Portugal out of the euro, in addition to wanting the dissolution of NATO.<ref name=dtel/>}}

[[Antonio Costa]], leader of the Socialist Party, called this a grave mistake and added "It is unacceptable to usurp the exclusive powers of parliament. The Socialists will not take lessons from Professor Cavaco Silva on the defence of our democracy." The Green politician [[Rui Tavares]] commented "The president has created a constitutional crisis. He is saying that he will never allow the formation of a government containing Leftists and Communists. People are amazed by what has happened." The opposition parties quickly announced their intention of bringing down the new government in a motion of rejection.<ref name=dtel/>

Eventually, Passos Coelho's government fell on a motion of no confidence, and the President appointed Antonio Costa, the leader of the Socialists, as Prime Minister in his place.

Cavaco Silva made state visits to countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. In his first year in office, he visited the former Portuguese colonies of Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau, and met with Portuguese troops in Bosnia and Kosovo. In September 2006, he visited Portugal's only neighbour, Spain.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Susete|title=Presidente visita Espanha em Setembro|trans-title=President visits Spain in September|url=https://www.dn.pt/arquivo/2006/interior/presidente-visita-espanha-em-setembro-644823.html|access-date=9 November 2015|work=Diário de Notícias|language=pt}}</ref>
