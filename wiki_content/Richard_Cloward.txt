'''Richard Andrew Cloward''' (December 25, 1926&nbsp;– August 20, 2001) was an American [[sociologist]] and an activist. He influenced the [[strain theory (sociology)|Strain theory of criminal behavior]] and the concept of [[anomie]], and was a primary motivator for the passage of the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] known as "Motor Voter". He taught at [[Columbia University]] for 47 years.

==Early life==
Cloward was born in [[Rochester, New York]], the son of Esther Marie (Fleming), an artist and women's rights activist, and Donald Cloward, a radical Baptist minister.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/23/nyregion/richard-cloward-welfare-rights-leader-dies-at-74.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=Richard Cloward, Welfare Rights Leader, Dies at 74 | date=August 23, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/21/obituaries/esther-m-f-cloward-women-s-rights-advocate-91.html|title=Esther M. F. Cloward, Women's Rights Advocate, 91|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 December 1989}}</ref> Cloward served as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[United States Navy]] from 1944 to 1946. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Rochester]] in 1949, and then a [[master's degree]] from the [[Columbia University School of Social Work]] in 1950. He then served as a [[first lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. Army]] from 1951 to 1954, and later worked as a [[social worker]] in an army prison in [[New Cumberland, Pennsylvania]]. Cloward became an assistant professor at Columbia's School of Social Work in 1954, and had visiting posts at the [[Hebrew University]], the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and [[Arizona State University]]. He received a doctorate in sociology from [[Columbia University]] in 1958.

Together with fellow sociologist [[Lloyd Ohlin]], Cloward wrote ''Delinquency and Opportunity: A Theory of Delinquent Gangs'', which rejected the prevailing premise that delinquency resulted from individual irresponsibility and argued it was caused by poverty and the lack of alternative opportunities caused by poverty, and that the conditions underlying delinquency could be resolved through social programs.<ref>Fox, Margalit. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/us/04ohlin.html Lloyd E. Ohlin, Expert on Crime and Punishment, Is Dead at 90], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 3, 2009. Accessed January 5, 2009.</ref>

==Political activities==
In 1966, Cloward co-founded the [[National Welfare Rights Organization]], which advocated federalizing [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] by building local [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] rolls. In 1982, he and his wife [[Frances Fox Piven]] founded "Human SERVE" (Service Employees Registration and Voter Education), which established motor-voter programs in selected states as precedents for the [[Motor Voter Act]] enacted in 1993.

Also in 1966, he and Piven published a paper in the May issue of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine&nbsp;— "The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty",<ref>{{cite news |title=The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty |last=Cloward |first=Richard |author2=Piven, Frances  |date=May 2, 1966 |publisher=The Nation |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/03/24-4}}</ref> which advocated wiping out poverty by increasing demands on the federal government, leading to implementation of a [[guaranteed minimum income]]. His detractors called this the "[[Cloward-Piven Strategy]]".
