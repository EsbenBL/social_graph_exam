Tipton, was finalist for a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1986,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/General-Nonfiction |title=The Pulitzer Prizes &#124; General Nonfiction |publisher=Columbia University }}</ref> won the [[Los Angeles Times Book Award|''Los Angeles Times'' Book Award]] in 1985 and received Highest Honors for a Book in Education from the American Educational Studies Association. ''Habits of the Heart'' sold over 500,000 copies<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-robert-bellah-20130804-story.html#page=1 |title=Robert N.

"Culture in Action: Symbols and Strategies"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Swidler |first=Anne |date=April 1986 |title=Culture in Action: Symbols and Strategies |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |publisher=Sage Publications |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=273–286 |doi=10.2307/2095521 |jstor=2095521 |citeseerx=10.1.1.320.417 }}</ref> (1986), argues that rather than just a form of internalized norms controlling behavior—argued by, for instance, [[Talcott Parsons]]—culture is a collection or "tool-kit" that people draw on to accomplish particular strategies of action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theculturelab.umd.edu/culture-as-tool-kit.html |title=Culture as "Tool Kit" |website=The Culture Lab |publisher=University of Maryland }}</ref> This is one of the most widely cited articles in sociology<ref name="cited" /> and informs the contemporary view in [[cultural sociology]] that culture is both constraining and enabling.

''[[Inequality by Design|Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth]]'' (1996), is a well-known reply to ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' by [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] and [[Richard Hernstein]] and attempts to show that the arguments in ''The Bell Curve'' are flawed.

''Talk of Love: How Culture Matters'' (2001) attempts to describe the reality of love in relationships amid the idealized and romanticized "talk of love" within American culture. In a review in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'', sociologist [[Michèle Lamont]] describes the book as "theoretically ambitious" as it "propose[s] nothing less than the reconceptualization of the role that culture plays in organizing social action."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lamont |first=Michèle |date=March 2004 |title=Reviewed Work: ''Talk of Love: How Culture Matters'' by Ann Swidler |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=1201–1203 |doi=10.1086/420661 }}<!--|accessdate=June 12, 2015--></ref>
