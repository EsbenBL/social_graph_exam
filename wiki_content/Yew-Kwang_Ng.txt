'''Yew-Kwang Ng''' ({{Zh|c=|s=黄有光|t=|p=}}; born August 7, 1942) is a [[Malaysian Australians|Malaysian-Australian]] economist, who is currently Professor of [[Economics]] at [[Fudan University]], [[Shanghai]],<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Yew-Kwang Ng 黃有光|url=https://econ.fudan.edu.cn/hyggrym.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705073444/https://econ.fudan.edu.cn/hyggrym.htm|archive-date=2020-07-05|access-date=2020-07-05|website=Fudan University, School of Economics}}</ref> and a Distinguished Fellow of the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]]. He has published in a variety of academic disciplines and is best known for his work in [[welfare economics]].

== Life and work ==
Ng was born during WW2, in [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese-occupied Malaya]]. While in high school, he was drawn to studying economics because of his ambition to "establish communism in an independent Malaysia"; the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China and events in the [[Soviet Union]] later led Ng to change his mind about the viability of communism.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last1=Wiblin|first1=Robert|last2=Harris|first2=Keiran|date=2018-07-26|title=Prof Yew-Kwang Ng on ethics and how to create a much happier world|url=https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/yew-kwang-ng-anticipating-effective-altruism/|access-date=2020-07-29|website=80,000 Hours|language=en-US}}</ref> Ng graduated with a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] from [[Nanyang University]] in 1966 and later a Ph.D. from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1971.<ref name=":4" /> During his studies at Nanyang University, amid the unrest of demonstrations and strikes, Ng came close to being arrested or expelled several times.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brief Biography Professor Yew|url=http://users.monash.edu/~mchou/Biography.htm|access-date=2020-08-02|website=Monash University User Web Pages}}</ref>

During the 1980s, working as a columnist, Ng wrote in support of Deng Xiaoping's [[Chinese economic reform]]s.<ref name=":3" /> Ng has been a Fellow of the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]] since 1981. He held a chair as professor of economics at [[Monash University]] between 1985 and 2012 and is now an emeritus professor. Between 2013 and 2019, Ng held the Winsemius chair at the Department of Economics at [[Nanyang Technological University]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ykng/Index.htm|title=Yew-Kwang Ng|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|website=Nanyang Technological University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728050338/http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ykng/Index.htm|archive-date=2018-07-28|access-date=2018-07-28}}</ref> In 2018, Ng delivered the inaugural Atkinson Memorial lecture at the [[University of Oxford]], dedicated to the memory of Sir [[Tony Atkinson]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Atkinson Memorial Lecture 2018: Presented by Professor Yew-Kwang Ng|url=https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/featured-events/atkinson-memorial-lecture-global-extinction-and-animal-welfare-two-priorities-for-effective-altruism|access-date=2020-08-02|website=University of Oxford, Department of Economics}}</ref> Since July 2019, Ng holds the position of Special Chair Professor at the School of Economics at Fudan University, Shanghai.<ref name=":2" /> He is also a columnist for the Chinese business news [[NetEase]] Finance online portal.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Feng|first=Jiayun|date=2020-06-03|title=Should Chinese women have multiple husbands?|url=https://supchina.com/2020/06/03/should-chinese-women-have-multiple-husbands/|access-date=2020-08-02|website=SupChina|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Economics ===
Ng is renowned for his work in welfare economics and a majority of his academic papers are in this area.<ref name=":1" /> He wrote his first book on the topic in 1979, ''Welfare Economics: Introduction and Development of Basic Concepts''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Welfare Economics: Introduction and Development of Basic Concepts|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1979|isbn=978-0333242964|location=London}}</ref> Within welfare economics, he is particularly known for his work on the theory of the third best, [[social choice theory]] and [[happiness economics]].<ref name=":1" /> In many publications, he defends a view of [[utility]] as being both [[Cardinal utility|cardinally measurable]] and [[social choice theory#Interpersonal utility comparison|interpersonally comparable]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|date=November 1997|title=A Case for Happiness, Cardinalism, and Interpersonal Comparability|url=https://www.colorado.edu/economics/morey/4999Ethics/Ng1997.pdf|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=107|issue=445|pages=1848–1858|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.1997.tb00087.x|access-date=2018-07-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728101433/https://www.colorado.edu/economics/morey/4999Ethics/Ng1997.pdf|archive-date=2018-07-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Ng coined the term "[[mesoeconomics]]" and helped establish the field as a simplified, tractable [[general equilibrium|general-equilibrium]] analysis with both micro and macro elements.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mesoeconomics: A Micro - Macro Analysis|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-312-53069-3|location=New York}}</ref> As a method, it is used to study the implications of imperfect competition on the macroeconomy. It has been argued that mesoeconomics "typically yields conclusions that are consistently more closely aligned with empirical evidence than any of the competing macroeconomic models."<ref name=":1" />

Ng contributed to the development of the new field of inframarginal economics, which "provides an analytical framework [...] to reconcile the focus of neoclassical economics on distribution with the preoccupations of classical economists [...] regarding the [[division of labour]]."<ref name=":1" /> He collaborated with [[Xiaokai Yang]] on this topic and in 1993 they published the joint book ''Specialization and Economic Organization: A New Classical Microeconomic Framework'', which was said to have "credibly  challenged  Neoclassical  Economics".<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ng|first1=Yew-Kwang|title=Specialization and Economic Organization: A New Classical Microeconomic Framework|last2=Yang|first2=Xiaokai|publisher=North Holland|year=1993|isbn=978-1-4832-9682-1|location=Amsterdam}}</ref>

=== Moral philosophy ===
In moral philosophy, Ng advocates for the [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] position of [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|hedonistic utilitarianism]]. He has defended this view in various academic papers, some of which were jointly written with the utilitarian moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ng|first1=Yew-Kwang|last2=Singer|first2=Peter|date=June 1981|title=An Argument for Utilitarianism|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|volume=11|issue=2|pages=229–239|jstor=40231194|doi=10.1080/00455091.1981.10716302}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ng|first1=Yew-Kwang|last2=Singer|first2=Peter|date=June 1983|title=Ng and Singer on Utilitarianism: A Reply|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|volume=13|issue=2|pages=241–242|jstor=40231317|doi=10.1080/00455091.1983.10716359}}</ref> He also argues for this position in his 2000 book ''Efficiency, Equality, and Public Policy''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Efficiency, Equality and Public Policy: With A Case for Higher Public Spending|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2000|isbn=978-1-349-39897-3|location=London|doi=10.1057/9780333992777}}</ref>

Thanks to his early work on [[animal welfare]], [[global catastrophic risk]]s and the measurement of wellbeing, he is credited with originating many ideas that would later be incorporated into the philosophy of [[effective altruism]].<ref name=":3" /> In a 2020 paper, Ng analyses the implications of the economic [[theory of the second best]] for effective altruism, arguing that we live in a "third best" world where informational and administrative constraints prevent us from realising the second best outcomes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|date=2020-08-01|title=Effective altruism despite the second-best challenge: Should indirect effects Be taken into account for policies for a better future?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328720300586|journal=Futures|language=en|volume=121|pages=102568|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2020.102568|issn=0016-3287}}</ref>

== Awards and honours ==
Ng has received a number of awards in recognition of his work. In 2007, he was made a Distinguished Fellow of the Economic Society of Australia, the highest award that the Society bestows.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Distinguished Fellow Award|url=http://esacentral.org.au/awards-item/15900/distinguished-fellow-award/?type_fr=379|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322191501/https://esacentral.org.au/awards-item/15900/distinguished-fellow-award/?type_fr=379|archive-date=2020-03-22|access-date=2018-07-28|website=The Economic Society of Australia|language=en}}</ref> In the tribute associated with the award, he was described as "one of Australia's most important and best internationally known economists."<ref name=":1" /> According to Economics Nobel Laureate [[Kenneth Arrow]], Ng is "one of the leading economic theorists of his generation" and Nobel Laureate [[James M. Buchanan|James Buchanan]] credited him to have "made major contributions in theoretical Welfare Economics."<ref name=":1" />

After Ng's retirement from Monash University, he was recognised as an "honorary and adjunct appointment" by the Department of Economics.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Honorary and adjunct appointments|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/economics/people/honorary-and-adjunct-appointments|access-date=2018-07-28|website=Monash Business School|language=en}}</ref> Given Ng's interest in global priorities research, he is on the advisory board of the Global Priorities Institute at the University of Oxford.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our Team|url=https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/people/|access-date=2020-08-02|website=Global Priorities Institute|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Politics ==
Ng has stated that "trying to avoid excessive inequality [is] a very important issue, and likely the third most important public issue after environmental protections and peacekeeping".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kaye |first1=Sion |title=The Moral Limits of Markets: A Conversation with Professor Yew-Kwang Ng |url=https://www.p4md.org/morality-and-markets-blog/2019/4/1/moral-limits-on-markets |website=The Project for Modern Democracy |access-date=15 October 2020}}</ref> He is also a proponent of generous immigration policies, stating that "immigrants bring in factors complementary to the local ones and make the economy more vibrant".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ng |first1=Yew-Kwang |title=Commentary: Expats, foreign talent and immigration make Singapore economically better off |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/commentary-expats-foreign-talent-and-immigration-make-singapore-10766870 |access-date=15 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Tan |first1=Jeanette |title=Concerns on immigration 'based on fallacies': NTU prof |url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/concerns-on-immigration-%E2%80%98based-on-fallacies%E2%80%99--ntu-prof-103620093.html |access-date=15 October 2020}}</ref>

In 2020, Ng wrote a column which suggested that allowing [[polyandry]] could be a way for China to reduce problems arising from [[Gender imbalance in China|the male-skewed gender ratio in the country]]. Ng also stated his intention to write a follow-up column discussing the pros and cons of legalizing prostitution.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ng |first1=Yew-Kwang |title=妻多夫制是否匪夷所思？ |url=https://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404511333914640507#_rnd1591199751480 |website=Weibo |access-date=15 October 2020}}</ref> The column went viral and attracted heavy criticism online; many critics said that Ng's arguments were misogynistic and offensive, while others objected to polyandry as contrary to traditional marriage.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|last=Fifield|first=Anna|date=2020-06-10|title=Two-husband strategy may be a remedy for China's one-child policy, professor posits|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/two-husband-strategy-may-be-a-remedy-for-chinas-one-child-policy-professor-posits/2020/06/10/56e6eff8-aac0-11ea-a43b-be9f6494a87d_story.html|access-date=2020-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Feng |first1=Jiayun |title=Should Chinese women have multiple husbands? |url=https://supchina.com/2020/06/03/should-chinese-women-have-multiple-husbands/ |access-date=25 January 2021 |work=SupChina |date=3 June 2020}}</ref>

== Philanthropy ==
In 2015, Ng offered to [[Matching funds|match]] all donations to up to $25,000 to the charity organization [[Animal Ethics (organization)|Animal Ethics]], a nonprofit organization aiming to promote animal ethics and to provide information and resources for animal advocates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Your donation to Animal Ethics will now be matched dollar for dollar |url=https://www.animal-ethics.org/your-donation-to-animal-ethics-will-now-be-matched-dollar-for-dollar/ |website=Animal Ethics}}</ref>

At the Nanyang Technological University Chinese Heritage Centre's [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] charity auction in 2016, Ng and his wife donated {{Currency|100000|SGD}}, which went towards the purchase of a painting by Master Yang Bailiang, a Chinese artist, which Ng donated to the centre and is now on permanent display.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=December 2016 – February 2017|title=A 21st century renaissance man?|url=http://enewsletter.ntu.edu.sg/(X(1)S(3jfnu2hcwdtk2dciquyw4cui))/ntulink/Dec16-Feb17/Pages/pp05.aspx|magazine=NTULink|issue=97|access-date=2020-08-02}}</ref>
