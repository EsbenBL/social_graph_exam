In 2002, the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]] awarded Bloom the Stanton Prize for outstanding early-career contributions to interdisciplinary research in [[philosophy]] and psychology,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Society for Philosophy and Psychology (SPP)|url=http://www.socphilpsych.org/prizes.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716230921/http://www.socphilpsych.org/prizes.html|archive-date=2020-07-16|access-date=2021-03-08|website=www.socphilpsych.org}}</ref> and in 2005-06, he served as the society's president.

In 2004, he received the Lex Hixon Prize for teaching excellence in the [[social sciences]] at Yale. In 2007, his Introduction to Psychology class was selected as an outstanding Yale course to be made available worldwide through the [[Open Yale Courses]] initiative.

== Bibliography ==
Bloom is the author of five books and editor or co-editor of three others. His research has appeared in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'', and his popular writing has appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''The [[American Scientist]]'', ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' and ''[[The Atlantic]]''.

His article in ''The Atlantic'', "Is God an Accident?"<ref name="The Atlantic"/> was included in ''[[The Best American Science Writing]]'' 2006.   Bloom concludes that "the universal themes of religion are not learned." Taking his cues from Darwin, Bloom posits that our spiritual tendencies emerged somewhere in the evolutionary process, most likely as "accidental by-products" of other traits.<ref name="Wired for Creationism?"/>
