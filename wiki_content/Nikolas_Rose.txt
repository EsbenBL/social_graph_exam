==Biography==
Originally trained as a [[biologist]], Nikolas Rose has done extensive work on the history and sociology of [[psychiatry]], on [[mental health]] policy and [[risk]], and on the social implications of recent developments in [[psychopharmacology]]. He has also published widely on the genealogy of [[subjectivity]], on the history of empirical thought in sociology, and on changing rationalities of political power. He is particularly known for his interpretation of the work of the French historian and philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] and the revival of the literature on [[governmentality]] in the Anglo-American world.

His book, ''Governing the Soul: the shaping of the private self'', is widely recognised as one of the founding texts in a new way of understanding and analysing the links between expertise, subjectivity and political power. He argues that the proliferation of the 'psy' disciplines has been intrinsically linked with transformations in [[governmentality]], in the rationalities and technologies of political power in 'advanced and liberal democracies'. (See also [[governmentality]] for a description of Rose's development of Foucault's concepts).

For six years he was managing editor of the journal ''Economy & Society'', one of the UK's leading interdisciplinary journal of social science, and he is now co-editor of ''[[BioSocieties: An interdisciplinary journal for social studies of life sciences]]''.

In 1989, he founded the History of the Present Research Network, an international network of researchers whose work was influenced by the writings of [[Michel Foucault]]. Together with [[Paul Rabinow]], he edited the Fourth Volume of [[Michel Foucault]]'s Essential Works.

In December 2001, he was listed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as one of the top five UK based social scientists, on the basis of a twenty-year analysis of citations to research papers, and the most cited UK based sociologist.{{Citation needed|reason=no link or mention to the Guardian's edition containing this information|date=May 2013}}

He was awarded in 2007 an [[ESRC]] Professorial Research Fellowship – a three-year project entitled 'Brain, Self and Society in the 21st Century'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/BIOS/home.aspx|title=BIOS - units - Research and expertise - Home|website=www.lse.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> In 2013, writing with Joelle Abi-Rached, he published  ''Neuro: the new brain sciences and the management of the mind''.

Throughout his academic career he has been a critical analyst of psychiatry.  His first book on this topic was published in 1986 - ''The Power of Psychiatry'', a collection edited together with Peter Miller   His most recent book ''Our Psychiatric Future: the politics of mental health'' was published by Polity Press in October 2018. His recent work has been on the social shaping of mental distress and its [[Biopolitics|biopolitical]] implications: his forthcoming book ''The Urban Brain: Mental Health in the Vital City'', written with Des Fitzgerald, will be published by Princeton University Press in 2022.
