In the course of his work as a [[physician]] and psychiatrist, Fanon supported [[Algerian War|Algeria's War of independence]] from France and was a member of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Algerian National Liberation Front]].

For more than five decades, the life and works of Frantz Fanon have inspired [[national liberation movements|national-liberation movements]] and other radical political organizations in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Sri Lanka]], South Africa, and the United States.<ref name=AliceCherki>Alice Cherki, ''Frantz Fanon.

Fanon published numerous books, including ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' (1961). This influential work focuses on what he believed is the necessary role of violence by activists in conducting decolonization struggles.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Frantz Fanon was born on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Martinique]], which was then a French [[French colonial empire|colony]] and is now a French [[single territorial collectivity]]. His father, Félix Casimir Fanon, was a descendant of African [[Slavery|slaves]], and worked as a customs agent. His mother, Eléanore Médélice, was of Afro-Martinican and white [[Alsace|Alsatian]] descent, and worked as a shopkeeper.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfwJCAAAQBAJ |title=What Fanon Said: A Philosophical Introduction to His Life and Thought |last1=Gordon |first1=Lewis R. |last2=Cornell |first2=Drucilla |date=2015-01-01 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823266081 |page=26 |language=en}}</ref> Frantz was the third of four sons in a family of eight children. Two of them died young, including his sister Gabrielle with whom Frantz was very close. His family was [[Socioeconomics|socio-economically]] [[middle-class]]. They could afford the fees for the Lycée Schoelcher, at the time the most prestigious [[Secondary school|high school]] in Martinique, where Fanon came to admire one of the school's teachers, poet and writer [[Aimé Césaire]].<ref name=EhlenBiog>Patrick Ehlen, ''Frantz Fanon: A Spiritual Biography'' (2001), New York: Crossroad 8th Avenue.</ref> Fanon left Martinique in 1943, when he was 18 years old, in order to join the [[Free France|Free French forces]].<ref>Nicholls, Tracey. ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/fanon/#H1</ref>

=== Martinique and World War II ===
After France fell to the [[Nazis]] in 1940, [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] naval troops were blockaded on Martinique. Forced to remain on the island, French sailors took over the government from the Martiniquan people and established a [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] Vichy regime. In the face of economic distress and isolation under the [[blockade]], they instituted an oppressive regime; Fanon described them as taking off their masks and behaving like "authentic [[Racism|racists]]".<ref>David Macey, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v058/58.1macey.html "Frantz Fanon, or the Difficulty of Being Martinican"], ''History Workshop Journal'', Project Muse. Retrieved 27 August 2010.</ref> Residents made many complaints of [[harassment]] and [[sexual misconduct]] by the sailors. The abuse of the Martiniquan people by the French Navy influenced Fanon, reinforcing his feelings of alienation and his disgust with colonial racism. At the age of seventeen, Fanon fled the island as a "dissident" (a term used for Frenchmen joining [[Charles de Gaulle|Gaullist]] forces), traveling to [[Dominica]] to join the [[Free French Forces]].<ref name=zellig>{{cite book |last1=Zeilig |first1=Leo |title=Frantz Fanon: A Political Biography |date=2021 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=9780755638239 |edition=First |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Frantz_Fanon/PyUhEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0}}</ref>{{rp|24}} After three attempts, he made it to Dominica, but it was too late to enlist. After the pro-Vichy [[:fr:Georges Robert (amiral)|Robert]] regime was deposed in Martinique in June 1943, Fanon returned to [[Fort-de-France]] to join the newly created, all black Fifth Infantry Battalion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Macey |first1=David |title=Frantz Fanon 1925-1961 |journal=History of Psychiatry |date=December 1996 |volume=7 |issue=28 |pages=489–497 |doi=10.1177/0957154X9600702802 |pmid=11618750 |citeseerx=10.1.1.858.188 |s2cid=45834503 |url=https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.858.188&rep=rep1&type=pdf}}</ref>

He enlisted in the Free French army and joined an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[convoy]] that reached [[Casablanca]]. He was later transferred to an army base at [[Béjaïa]] on the [[Kabylie]] coast of [[Algeria]]. Fanon left Algeria from [[Oran]] and served in France, notably in the battles of [[Alsace]]. In 1944 he was wounded at [[Colmar]] and received the ''[[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Macey|first=David|date=December 1996|title=Frantz Fanon 1925-1961|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0957154X9600702802|journal=History of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=7|issue=28|page=490|doi=10.1177/0957154X9600702802|pmid=11618750|s2cid=45834503|issn=0957-154X}}</ref> When the Nazis were defeated and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces crossed the [[Rhine]] into Germany along with [[Photojournalism|photo journalists]], Fanon's regiment was "bleached" of all non-white soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} Fanon and his fellow [[Afro-Caribbean]] soldiers were sent to [[Toulon]] (Provence).<ref name=MaceyBiog /> Later, they were transferred to [[Normandy]] to await [[repatriation]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

During the war, Fanon was exposed to more white European racism. For example, European women liberated by black soldiers often preferred to dance with [[Fascism|fascist]] Italian prisoners, rather than fraternize with their liberators.<ref name=":0" />

In 1945, Fanon returned to Martinique. He lasted a short time there. He worked for the parliamentary campaign of his friend and mentor [[Aimé Césaire]], who would be a major influence in his life. Césaire ran on the [[French Communist Party|communist ticket]] as a [[Parliamentary delegation|parliamentary delegate]] from Martinique to the first National Assembly of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fanon stayed long enough to complete his [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] and then went to France, where he studied medicine and psychiatry.

Fanon was educated in [[Lyon]], where he also studied literature, drama and philosophy, sometimes attending [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s lectures. During this period, he wrote three plays, of which two survive.<ref>Fanon, Frantz (2015). [http://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-_crits_sur_l_alienation_et_la_liberte-9782707188717.html ''Écrits sur l'aliénation et la liberté'']. Éditions La Découverte, Paris. {{ISBN|9782707188717}}</ref> After qualifying as a [[psychiatrist]] in 1951, Fanon did a residency in psychiatry at [[Saint-Alban-sur-Limagnole]] under the radical [[Catalan people|Catalan]] psychiatrist [[François Tosquelles]], who invigorated Fanon's thinking by emphasizing the role of culture in psychopathology.

===France===
In France while completing his residency, Fanon wrote and published his first book, ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'' (1952), an analysis of the negative psychological effects of [[Colonialism|colonial]] subjugation upon black people. Originally, the manuscript was the [[Thesis|doctoral dissertation]], submitted at Lyon, entitled "Essay on the Disalienation of the Black", which was a response to the racism that Fanon experienced while studying psychiatry and medicine at university in Lyon; the rejection of the dissertation prompted Fanon to publish it as a book. For his doctor of philosophy degree, he submitted another dissertation of narrower scope and different subject. [[Left-wing]] philosopher [[Francis Jeanson]], leader of the pro-Algerian independence [[Jeanson network]], read Fanon's manuscript and insisted upon the new title; he also wrote the epilogue. Jeanson was a senior book editor at [[Éditions du Seuil]], in Paris.<ref name=ACherki>{{cite book |last=Cherki|first=Alice|title=Frantz Fanon: A Portrait|url=https://archive.org/details/frantzfanonportr00cher|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-7308-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/frantzfanonportr00cher/page/24 24]}}</ref>

When Fanon submitted the manuscript to Seuil, Jeanson invited him for an editor–author meeting; he said it did not go well as Fanon was nervous and over-sensitive. Despite Jeanson praising the manuscript, Fanon abruptly interrupted him and asked: "Not bad for a nigger, is it?" Jeanson was insulted, became angry, and dismissed Fanon from his editorial office. Later Jeanson said he learned that his response to Fanon's discourtesy earned him the writer's lifelong respect. Afterward, their working and personal relationships became much easier. Fanon agreed to Jeanson's suggested title, ''Black Skin, White Masks.''<ref name=ACherki/>

In the book, Fanon described the unfair treatment of black people in France and how they were disapproved of by white people. Black people also had a sense of inferiority when facing white people. Fanon believed that even though they could speak French, they could not fully integrate into the life and environment of white people. (See further discussion of ''Black Skin, White Masks'' under Work, below.)

===Algeria===

After his residency, Fanon practised psychiatry at [[Pontorson]], near [[Mont Saint-Michel]], for another year and then (from 1953) in [[Algeria]]. He was ''chef de service'' at the [[Blida | Blida-Joinville]] Psychiatric Hospital in Algeria. He worked there until his deportation in January 1957.<ref name="Cherki">Alice Cherki, ''Frantz Fanon. Portrait'' (2000), Paris: Seuil; David Macey, ''Frantz Fanon: A Biography'' (2000), New York: Picador Press.</ref>

Fanon's methods of treatment started evolving, particularly by beginning [[Sociotherapy|socio-therapy]] to connect with his patients' [[Culture|cultural backgrounds]]. He also trained nurses and interns. Following the outbreak of the [[Algerian War|Algerian revolution]] in November 1954, Fanon joined the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]], after having made contact with Dr [[Pierre Chaulet]] at [[Blida]] in 1955. Working at a French hospital in Algeria, Fanon became responsible for treating the psychological distress of the French soldiers and officers who carried out torture in order to suppress anti-colonial resistance. Additionally, Fanon was also responsible for treating Algerian [[torture]] victims.

Fanon made extensive trips across Algeria, mainly in the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] region, to study the cultural and psychological life of Algerians. His lost study of "The [[marabout]] of Si Slimane" is an example. These trips were also a means for clandestine activities, notably in his visits to the ski resort of [[Chrea]] which hid an [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] base.

===Joining the FLN and exile from Algeria===

By summer 1956 Fanon realized that he could no longer continue to support French efforts, even indirectly via his hospital work. In November he submitted his ''"Letter of resignation to the Resident Minister"'' which later became an influential text of its own in [[anti-colonialist]] circles.<ref name="Azar00">{{cite journal |last1=Azar |first1=Michael |title=In the Name of Algeria: Frantz Fanon and the Algerian Revolution |journal=Eurozine |date=6 December 2000 |url=https://www.eurozine.com/in-the-name-of-algeria/ |access-date=30 December 2020}}</ref>

<blockquote>
There comes a time when silence becomes dishonesty. The ruling intentions of personal existence are not in accord with the permanent assaults on the most commonplace values. For many months my conscience has been the seat of unpardonable debates. And the conclusion is the determination not to despair of man, in other words, of myself. The decision I have reached is that I cannot continue to bear a responsibility at no matter what cost, on the false pretext that there is nothing else to be done.
</blockquote>

Shortly afterwards, Fanon was expelled from Algeria and moved to [[Tunis]] where he joined the FLN openly. He was part of the editorial collective of ''[[Al Moudjahid]]'', for which he wrote until the end of his life. He also served as [[Ambassador]] to [[Ghana]] for the Provisional Algerian Government ([[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic|GPRA]]). He attended conferences in [[Accra]], [[Conakry]], [[Addis Ababa]], [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]], [[Cairo]] and [[Tripoli]]. Many of his shorter writings from this period were collected posthumously in the book ''[[Toward the African Revolution]]''. In this book Fanon reveals war tactical strategies; in one chapter he discusses how to open a southern front to the war and how to run the supply lines.<ref name="Cherki"/>

Upon his return to [[Tunis]], after his exhausting trip across the [[Sahara]] to open a Third Front, Fanon was diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. He went to the [[Soviet Union]] for treatment and experienced some [[Cure|remission]] of his illness. When he came back to Tunis once again, he dictated his testament ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]''. When he was not confined to his bed, he delivered lectures to [[Armée de Libération Nationale]] (ALN) officers at [[Ghardimaou|Ghardimao]] on the Algerian-Tunisian border. He traveled to [[Rome]] for a three-day meeting with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who had greatly influenced his work. Sartre agreed to write a preface to Fanon's last book, [[The Wretched of the Earth]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Massey |first1=David |title=Frantz Fanon: A Biography |date=2000 |publisher=Picador}}</ref>

===Death and aftermath===

In 1961, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] arranged a trip to the [[United States|U.S.]] for further leukemia treatment at a [[National Institutes of Health]] facility.<ref>Angelo Codevilla, ''Informing Statecraft'' (1992, New York).</ref> During his time in the United States, Fanon was handled by CIA agent Oliver Iselin.<ref>Thomas Meaney (2019), "Frantz Fanon and the CIA Man", ''The American Historical Review'' '''124'''(3): 983–995.</ref>

Fanon died in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], on 6 December 1961, under the name of "Ibrahim Fanon", a Libyan ''[[nom de guerre]]'' that he had assumed in order to enter a hospital in [[Rome]] after being wounded in [[Morocco]] during a mission for the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hopkins1.edublogs.org/files/2010/10/WE-Foreward-by-Homi-Bhabha-2004-1pw5wvp.pdf|title=Foreword: Framing Fanon|first=Homi K.|last=Bhabha|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref> He was buried in Algeria after [[lying in state]] in [[Tunisia]].

==Work==
=== ''Black Skin, White Masks'' ===

''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'' was published in 1952 and is one of Fanon's most important works. In ''Black Skin, White Masks,'' Fanon psychoanalyzes the oppressed Black person who is perceived to have to be a lesser creature in the White world that they live in, and studies how they navigate the world through a performance of [[Whiteness studies|White-ness]].<ref name=":0" /> Particularly in discussing language, he talks about how the black person's use of a colonizer's language is seen by the colonizer as predatory, and not transformative, which in turn may create insecurity in the black's consciousness.<ref name=":1" /> He recounts that he himself faced many admonitions as a child for using [[Creole language|Creole French]] instead of "real French," or "French French," that is, "white" French.<ref name=":0" /> Ultimately, he concludes that "mastery of language [of the white/colonizer] for the sake of recognition ''as white'' reflects a dependency that subordinates the black's humanity".<ref name=":1" />

==== "The Negro and Language" ====

Chapter 1 of ''Black Skin, White Masks'' is entitled “The Negro and Language."<ref name="Black Skin, White Masks">{{cite book |last1=Fanon |first1=Frantz |title=Black Skin, White Masks |date=1952 |publisher=Editions de Seuil |pages=82–109}}</ref> In this chapter, Fanon discusses how colored people were perceived by the whites. He says that the black man has two dimensions. One with his fellows, the other with the white man. A Negro behaves differently with a white man than with another Negro. That this self-division is a direct result of colonialist subjugation is beyond question. To speak a language is to take on a world, a culture. The Antilles Negro who wants to be white will be the whiter as he gains greater mastery of the cultural tool that language is. Fanon concludes this theorizing by saying “Historically, it must be understood that the Negro wants to speak French because it is the key that can open doors which were still barred to him fifty years ago. In the Antilles Negro who comes within this study we find a quest for subtleties, for refinements of language—so many further means of proving to himself that he has measured up to the culture.”

==== "The Fact of Blackness" ====

Chapter 5 of ''Black Skin, White Masks'' is entitled “The Fact of Blackness."<ref name="Black Skin, White Masks"/> In this chapter, Fanon tackles many theories. One theory he addresses is the different [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] that are said to exist within a person, and how they exist differently for Black people. He talks about one's “bodily schema” (83), and theorizes that because of both the “historical-racial schema” (84),-- one that exists because of the history of racism and makes it so there is no one bodily-schema because of the context that comes with Blackness—and one's “epidermal-racial schema” (84), -- where Black people cannot be seen for their single bodily-schema because they are seen to represent their race and the history and therefore cannot be seen past their flesh—there is no universal Black schema. He describes this experience as “no longer a question of being aware of my body in the third person but in a triple person.” Fanon concludes this theorizing by saying “As long as the black man is among his own, he will have no occasion, except in minor internal conflicts, to experience his being through others.”

Fanon also addresses [[Ontology]], stating that it “—does not permit us to understand the being of the black man”(82). He says that because Blackness was created in, and continues to exist in, negation to whiteness, that ontology is not a philosophy that can be used to understand the Black experience. Fanon states that this ontology can't be used to understand the Black experience because it ignores the "lived experience." He argues that a black man has to be black, while also being black in relation to the white man.(90)

==== "The Negro and Psychopathology" ====

Chapter 6 of ''Black Skin, White Masks'' is entitled "The Negro and Psychopathology".<ref name="Black Skin, White Masks"/> In this chapter, Fanon discussed how being Black can and does affect one's psyche. He makes it clear that the treatment of Black people causes emotional trauma. Fanon argues that as a result of one's skin color being Black, Black people are unable to truly process this trauma or "make it unconscious" (466). Black people are unable to not think about the fact that they are Black and all of the historical and current stigma that come with that. Fanon's work in this chapter specifically shows the short-comings of major names in psychology such as [[Sigmund Freud]]. However, Fanon repeatedly mentions the importance of [[Jacques Lacan]]’s theory of language.<ref>Richards, Sinan (Summer 2021). "The Logician of Madness: Fanon’s Lacan". Paragraph. 44 (2): 214–237. doi:10.3366/para.2021.0366 {{cite journal |url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/para.2021.0366|title=The Logician of Madness: Fanon's Lacan|year=2021|language=en|publisher=Paragraph Journal|doi=10.3366/para.2021.0366|edition= Summer 2021|access-date=6 June 2021|last1=Richards|first1=Sinan|journal=Paragraph|volume=44|issue=2|pages=214–237}}</ref> Fanon discusses the mental health of Black people to show that "traditional" psychology was created and founded without thinking about Black people and their experiences.

Although Fanon wrote ''Black Skin, White Masks'' while still in France, most of his work was written in [[North Africa]]. It was during this time that he produced works such as ''L'An Cinq, de la Révolution Algérienne'' in 1959 (''Year Five of the Algerian Revolution''), later republished as ''Sociology of a Revolution'' and later still as ''[[A Dying Colonialism]]''. Fanon's original title was "Reality of a Nation"; however the publisher, [[François Maspero]], refused to accept this title.

Fanon is best known for the classic analysis of [[colonialism]] and [[decolonization]], ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]''.<ref>Sartre, Jean-Paul. "Preface". Fanon, Frantz. ''Black Skin, White Masks'', trans. Charles Lam Markmann (1967, New York: Grove Press)</ref> ''The Wretched of the Earth'' was first published in 1961 by [[François Maspero|Éditions Maspero]], with a preface by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tanbou.com/1996/SatreExtraits.htm|title=Extraits de la préface de Jean-Paul Sartre au "Les Damnés de la Terre" (Extracts from the preface by Jean-Paul Sartre to ''The Wretched of the Earth'')|language=fr|publisher=Tambour Journal|edition= Winter 1996|access-date=14 February 2007}}</ref> In it Fanon analyzes the role of [[Social class|class]], [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|race]], national culture and violence in the struggle for national liberation. The book includes an article which focuses on the ideas of violence and [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonization]]. He claims that decolonization is inherently a violent process, because the relationship between the settler and the native is a binary of opposites. In fact, he uses the Biblical metaphor, "The last shall be first, and the first, last," to describe the moment of decolonization. The situation of [[settler colonialism]] creates within the native a tension which grows over time and in many ways is fostered by the settler. This tension is initially released among the natives, but eventually it becomes a catalyst for violence against the settler. His work would become an academic and theoretical foundation for many revolutions.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=The wretched of the earth|last=1925-1961.|first=Fanon, Frantz|date=1983 |publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140224542|location=Harmondsworth|oclc=12480619}}</ref>

Fanon uses the Jewish people to explain how the prejudice expressed towards blacks cannot not be generalized to other races or ethnicities. He discusses this in ''Black Skins, White Masks'', and pulls from Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Reflections on the Jewish Question'' to inform his understanding of French colonialism relationship with the Jewish people and how it can be compared and contrasted with the oppressions of Blacks across the world. In his seminal book, Fanon issues many rebuttals to [[Octave Mannoni]]'s ''Prospero and Caliban: The Psychology of Colonization''. Mannoni asserts that "colonial exploitation is not the same as other forms of exploitation, and colonial racialism is different from other kinds of racialism." Fanon responds by arguing that racism or anti-Semitism, colonial or otherwise, are not different because they rip away a person's ability to feel human. He says "I am deprived of the possibility of being a man. I cannot disassociate myself from the future that is proposed for my brother. Every one of my acts commits me as a man. Every one of my silences, every one of my cowardices reveals me as a man."  In this same vein, Fanon echoes the philosophies of [[Maryse Choisy]], who believed that remaining neutral in times of great injustice implied an unforgivable complicity. Specifically, Fanon mentions the ravages of racism and anti-Semitism because he believes that those who are one are necessarily the other as well. Yet he is careful to distinguish between the causes of the two. Fanon argues that the reasons for hating "The Jew" are born from a different fear than those for hating Blacks. Bigots are scared of Jews because they are threatened by what the Jew represents. The many tropes and stereotypes of Jewish cruelty, laziness, and cunning are the antithesis of the Western work ethic. The Black man is feared for perhaps similar traits, but the impetus is different. Essentially, "The Jew" is simply an idea, but Blacks are feared for their physical attributes. Jewishness is not easily detectable to the naked eye, but race is.{{Citation needed|reason=Not giving an opinion here. It is hard to know what comes from Fanon's books and can be viewed as commentary. More quotes needed from the text and signs of author's presence, like 'Fanon wrote', etc.|date=May 2018}}

Both books established Fanon in the eyes of much of the [[Third World]] as the leading anti-colonial thinker of the 20th century.

Fanon's three books were supplemented by numerous psychiatry articles as well as radical critiques of French colonialism in journals such as ''Esprit'' and [[El Moudjahid]].

The reception of his work has been affected by English translations which are recognized to contain numerous omissions and errors, while his unpublished work, including his doctoral thesis, has received little attention. As a result, it has been argued Fanon has often been portrayed as an advocate of violence (it would be more accurate to characterize him as a dialectical opponent of nonviolence) and that his ideas have been extremely oversimplified. This reductionist vision of Fanon's work ignores the subtlety of his understanding of the colonial system. For example, the fifth chapter of ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'' translates, literally, as "The Lived Experience of the Black" ("L'expérience vécue du Noir"), but Markmann's translation is "The Fact of Blackness", which leaves out the massive influence of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] on Fanon's early work.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moten|first=Fred|title=The Case of Blackness|journal=Criticism|date=Spring 2008|volume=50|issue=2|pages=177–218|doi=10.1353/crt.0.0062}}</ref>

=== ''A Dying Colonialism'' ===

''[[A Dying Colonialism]]'' is a 1959 book by Fanon that provides an account of how, during the Algerian Revolution, the people of Algeria changed centuries-old cultural patterns and embraced certain ancient cultural practices long derided by their colonialist oppressors as “primitive,” in order to destroy those oppressors. Fanon uses the fifth year of the Algerian Revolution as a point of departure for an explication of the inevitable dynamics of colonial oppression. This is a strong, lucid, and militant book; to read it is to understand why Fanon says that for the colonized, “having a gun is the only chance you still have of giving a meaning to your death.”<ref>Summary of "A Dying Colonialism" by Publisher Grove Atlantic. Viewed on Jan 15th 2019. [https://groveatlantic.com/book/a-dying-colonialism/].</ref> One of the most influential articles, "Unveiled Algeria," also comes from this book. It signifies the fall of imperialism and demonstrates how people struggle to decolonize their "mind" to avoid assimilation.

=== ''The Wretched of the Earth'' ===

In ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' (1961, ''Les damnés de la terre''), published shortly before Fanon's death, Fanon defends the right of a colonized people to use violence to gain independence. In addition, he delineated the processes and forces leading to national independence or neocolonialism during the decolonization movement that engulfed much of the world after [[World War II]]. In defence of the use of violence by colonized peoples, Fanon argued that human beings who are not considered as such (by the colonizer) shall not be bound by principles that apply to humanity in their attitude towards the colonizer. His book was [[Censorship in France|censored]] by the French government.

For Fanon in ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'', the colonizer's presence in Algeria is based on sheer military strength. Any resistance to this strength must also be of a violent nature because it is the only "language" the colonizer speaks. Thus, violent resistance is a necessity imposed by the colonists upon the colonized. The relevance of language and the reformation of discourse pervades much of his work, which is why it is so interdisciplinary, spanning psychiatric concerns to encompass politics, sociology, anthropology, linguistics and literature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

His participation in the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] from 1955 determined his audience as the Algerian colonized. It was to them that his final work, ''Les damnés de la terre'' (translated into English by Constance Farrington as ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'') was directed. It constitutes a warning to the oppressed of the dangers they face in the whirlwind of decolonization and the transition to a [[Neocolonialism|neo-colonialist]], [[Globalization|globalized]] world.<ref>"Two centuries ago, a former European colony decided to catch up with Europe. It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster, in which the taints, the sickness and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appalling dimensions.

Comrades, have we not other work to do than to create a third Europe? [...] It is a question of the Third World starting a new history of Man, a history which will have regard to the sometimes prodigious theses which Europe has put forward, but which will also not forget Europe's crimes, of which the most horrible was committed in the heart of man, and consisted of the pathological tearing apart of his functions and the crumbling away of his unity. And in the framework of the collectivity there were the differentiations, the stratification and the bloodthirsty tensions fed by classes; and finally, on the immense scale of humanity, there were racial hatreds, slavery, exploitation and above all the bloodless genocide which consisted in the setting aside of fifteen thousand millions of men.
So, comrades, let us not pay tribute to Europe by creating states, institutions and societies which draw their inspiration from her."
''The Wretched of the Earth'' – "[http://marxists.org/subject/africa/fanon/conclusion.htm Conclusions"].</ref>

An often overlooked aspect of Fanon's work is that he did not like to physically write his pieces. Instead, he would dictate to his wife, Josie, who did all of the writing and, in some cases, contributed and edited.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=What Fanon Said|last=Gordon|first=Lewis|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2015|location=New York}}</ref>

==Influences==
Fanon was influenced by a variety of thinkers and [[School of thought|intellectual traditions]] including [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[Négritude]], and [[Marxism]].<ref name=AliceCherki />

[[Aimé Césaire]] was a particularly significant influence in Fanon's life. Césaire, a leader of the ''[[Négritude]]'' movement, was teacher and [[Mentorship|mentor]] to Fanon on the island of Martinique.<ref>''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', second edition, 2010, p. 1438.</ref> Fanon was first introduced to ''Négritude'' during his lycée days in Martinique when Césaire coined the term and presented his ideas in ''[[Tropiques]]'', the journal that he edited with Suzanne Césaire, his wife, in addition to his now classic ''[[Cahier d'un retour au pays natal]] '' (Journal of a Homecoming).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfwJCAAAQBAJ|title=What Fanon Said: A Philosophical Introduction to His Life and Thought|last1=Gordon|first1=Lewis R.|last2=Cornell|first2=Drucilla|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=9780823266081|language=en}}</ref> Fanon referred to Césaire's writings in his own work. He quoted, for example, his teacher at length in "The Lived Experience of the Black Man", a heavily [[Anthology|anthologized]] essay from ''Black Skins, White Masks''.<ref>[[Imre Szeman]] and Timothy Kaposy (eds), ''Cultural Theory: An Anthology'', 2011, Wiley-Blackwell, p. 431.</ref>

==Legacy==
Fanon has had an influence on anti-colonial and [[national liberation movements]]. In particular, ''Les damnés de la terre'' was a major influence on the work of revolutionary leaders such as [[Ali Shariati]] in Iran, [[Steve Biko]] in South Africa, [[Malcolm X]] in the United States and [[Ernesto Che Guevara]] in [[Cuba]]. Of these only Guevara was primarily concerned with Fanon's theories on violence;<ref>{{Cite web|title="Black Skin White Mask" Documentary About Revolutionary Frantz Fanon|url=https://originalpeople.org/black-skin-white-mask-documentary-revolutionary-frantz-fanon/|last1=July 20|first1=Frantz Omar Fanon Born|last2=Fort-de-France|first2=1925|date=2013-10-05|website=Originalpeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-27|last3=Martinique|last4=December 6|first4=France Died|last5=1961Bethesda|last6=Maryl|last7=Fanon|first7=SpouseJosie Fanon Children Olivier|last8=France|first8=Mireille Fanon-Mendès}}</ref> for Shariati, Biko and also Guevara the main interest in Fanon was "the new man" and "[[Black Consciousness Movement|black consciousness]]" respectively.<ref>[[Lewis Gordon|Lewis R.

White (eds), ''Fanon: A Critical Reader'' (1996: Oxford: Blackwell), p. 163, and Bianchi, Eugene C., ''The Religious Experience of Revolutionaries'' (1972: Doubleday), p. 206.</ref>

With regard to the American liberation struggle more commonly known as [[Black Power movement|The Black Power Movement]], Fanon's work was especially influential. His book ''Wretched of the Earth'' is quoted directly in the preface of [[Stokely Carmichael]] (Kwame Ture) and [[Charles V. Hamilton|Charles Hamilton]]'s book, ''[[Black Power: The Politics of Liberation]]''<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Black power : the politics of liberation in America|last=1941-1998.|first=Carmichael, Stokely|date=1992|publisher=Vintage Books|others=Hamilton, Charles V.|isbn=978-0679743132|edition=Vintage|location=New York|oclc=26096713|url=https://archive.org/details/blackpowerpoliti00carm_0}}</ref> which was published in 1967, shortly after Carmichael left the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). In addition, Carmichael and Hamilton include much of Fanon's theory on [[Colonialism]] in their work, beginning by framing the situation of former slaves in America as a colony situated inside a nation. "To put it another way, there is no "American dilemma" because black people in this country form a colony, and it is not in the interest of the colonial power to liberate them" (Ture Hamilton, 5).<ref name=":3" /> Another example is the indictment of the black middle class or what Fanon called the "colonized intellectual" as the indoctrinated followers of the colonial power. Fanon states, "The native intellectual has clothed his aggressiveness in his barely veiled desire to assimilate himself to the colonial world" (47).<ref name=":2" /> A third example is the idea that the natives (African Americans) should be constructing new social systems rather than participating in the systems created by the settler population. Ture and Hamilton contend that "black people should create rather than imitate" (144).<ref name=":3" />

The Black Power group that Fanon had the most influence on was the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP). In 1970 [[Bobby Seale]], the Chairman of the BPP, published a collection of recorded observations made while he was incarcerated entitled ''[[Seize The Time: The Story of The Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton|Seize the Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton]]''.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=Seize the time : the story of the Black Panther party and Huey P.

While describing one of his first meetings with [[Huey P. Newton]], Seale describes bringing him a copy of ''Wretched of the Earth''. There are at least three other direct references to the book, all of them mentioning ways in which the book was influential and how it was included in the curriculum required of all new BPP members. Beyond just reading the text, Seale and the BPP included much of the work in their party platform. The Panther 10 Point Plan contained 6 points which either directly or indirectly referenced ideas in Fanon's work including their contention that there must be an end to the "robbery by the white man," and "education that teaches us our true history and our role in present day society" (67).<ref name=":4" /> One of the most important elements adopted by the BPP was the need to build the "humanity" of the native. Fanon claimed that the realization by the native that s/he was human would mark the beginning of the push for freedom (33).<ref name=":2" /> The BPP embraced this idea through the work of their Community Schools and [[Free Breakfast for Children|Free Breakfast Programs]].

Bolivian indianist [[Fausto Reinaga]] also had some Fanon influence and he mentions ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' in his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''La Revolución India'', advocating for decolonisation of native [[South America]]ns from European influence. In 2015 [[Raúl Zibechi]] argued that Fanon had become a key figure for the [[Latin America]]n [[Left-wing politics|left]].<ref>[http://compamanuel.com/2015/09/19/zibechi-red-hot-interest-in-fanon/ Red-hot interest in Fanon], Raul Zibechi, 2015</ref> In August 2021 Fanon's book ''Voices of liberation'' was one of those brought by [[Elisa Loncón]] to the new "plurinational library" of the [[Constitutional Convention (Chile)|Constitutional Convention of Chile]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Los libros que mostró Elisa Loncon en la Convención y que apuntan a una “biblioteca plurinacional”|url=https://www.latercera.com/culto/2021/08/03/los-libros-que-mostro-elisa-loncon-en-la-convencion-y-que-apuntan-a-una-biblioteca-plurinacional/|last=Retamal N.|first=Pablo|date=August 3, 2021|access-date=August 10, 2021|work=[[La Tercera]]|language=Spanish}}</ref> 

Fanon's influence extended to the liberation movements of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], the [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s, [[African American]]s and others. His work was a key influence on the [[Black Panther Party]], particularly his ideas concerning [[nationalism]], violence and the [[lumpenproletariat]]. More recently, radical South African poor people's movements, such as [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] (meaning 'people who live in shacks' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]]), have been influenced by Fanon's work.<ref>[http://abahlali.org/files/uprightandfree.pdf Nigel C. Gibson, "Upright and free: Fanon in South Africa, from Biko to the shackdwellers' movement (Abahlali baseMjondolo)]", ''Social Identities'', 14:6, 2008, pp. 683–715.</ref> His work was a key influence on Brazilian educationist [[Paulo Freire]], as well.

Fanon has also profoundly affected contemporary African literature. His work serves as an important theoretical gloss for writers including Ghana's [[Ayi Kwei Armah]], Senegal's [[Ken Bugul]] and [[Ousmane Sembène]], [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[Tsitsi Dangarembga]], and [[Kenya]]'s [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]]. Ngũgĩ goes so far to argue in ''[[Decolonising the Mind|Decolonizing the Mind]]'' (1992) that it is "impossible to understand what informs African writing" without reading Fanon's ''Wretched of the Earth''.<ref>Vincent B. Leitch et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of Theory & Criticism'', second edition 2010: New York: W. W.

Fanon's writings on black sexuality in ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'' have garnered critical attention by a number of academics and [[queer theory]] scholars. Interrogating Fanon's perspective on the nature of black homosexuality and masculinity, queer theory academics have offered a variety of critical responses to Fanon's words, balancing his position within [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]] with his influence on the formation of contemporary black [[queer theory]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alessandrini|first1=Anthony C.|title=Frantz Fanon: Critical Persepectives|date=1999|publisher=Routledge}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pellegrini|first1=Ann|title=Performance Anxieties: Staging Psychoanalysis, Staging Race|url=https://archive.org/details/performanceanxie0000pell|url-access=registration|date=1997|publisher=Routledge}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Stecopoulos|first1=Harry|title=Race and the Subject of Masculinities|date=1997|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=31–38|chapter=Fanon: Race and Sexuality}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mars-Jones|first1=Adam|title=Black is the colour|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/black-is-the-colour-1257983.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mercer|first1=Kobena|editor1-last=Read|editor1-first=Alan|title=Decolonization and Disappointment: Reading Fanon's Sexual Politics|date=1996|publisher=Bay Press|location=Seattle|chapter=The fact of Blackness: Frantz Fanon and Visual Representation}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fuss|first1=Diana|title=Interior Colonies: Frantz Fanon and the Politics of Identification|journal=Diacritics|date=1994|volume=24|issue=2/3|pages=19–42|jstor=465162|doi=10.2307/465162}}</ref>

Fanon's legacy has expanded even further into Black Studies and more specifically, into the theories of [[Afro-pessimism]] and Black Critical Theory. Thinkers such as [[Sylvia Wynter]], David Marriott, [[Frank B. Wilderson III]], Jared Sexton, Calvin Warren, Patrice Douglass, Zakkiyah Iman Jackson, Axelle Karera, and Selamawit Terrefe have taken up Fanon's [[Ontology|ontological]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] analyses of the Negro and the “zone of non-being” in order to develop theories of anti-Blackness. Putting Fanon in conversation with prominent thinkers like Sylvia Wynter, [[Saidiya Hartman]], and [[Hortense Spillers]] and focusing primarily on the Charles Lam Markmann translation of ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'', Black Critical Theorists and Afropessimists take seriously the ontological implications of the “Fact of Blackness” and “The Negro and Psychopathology,” formulating the Black or the Slave as the non-relational, phobic object that constitutes [[Antonio Gramsci|civil society]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Skin, White Masks|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|others=Markmann, Charles Lam., Sardar, Ziauddin., Bhabha, Homi K., 1949-|isbn=9781435691063|edition= New|location=London|oclc=298658340}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Red, White & Black : Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms|last=Wilderson III|first=Frank B.|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822346920|location=Durham, NC|oclc=457770963}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Whither Fanon?: Studies in the Blackness of Being|last=Marriott|first=D.|year=2018|isbn=9780804798709|location=Stanford, California|oclc=999542477}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Amalgamation schemes : Antiblackness and the Critique of Multiracialism|last=Jared|first=Sexton|date=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816656639|location=Minneapolis|oclc=318220788}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Scenes of subjection : Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America|last=V.|first=Hartman, Saidiya|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195089839|location=New York|oclc=36417797}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ontological Terror: Blackness, Nihilism, and Emancipation|last=Warren|first=Calvin L.|isbn=9780822371847|location=Durham|oclc=1008764960|date = 2018-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Black, White, and in Color : Essays on American Literature and Culture|last=J., Spillers|first=Hortense|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226769798|location=Chicago|oclc=50604796}}</ref>
