'''Hirsh Zvi Griliches''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɪ|l|ɪ|k|ə|s}} {{respell|GRIL|i|kəs}}; 12 September 1930 – 4 November 1999)<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE2D81E3BF936A35752C1A96F958260 NY Times Obituary: Zvi Griliches, 69, an Authority On Analysis of Economic Data]</ref> was an [[economist]] at [[Harvard University]].  The works by Zvi Griliches mostly concerned the [[economics]] of [[technological change]], including [[empirical research|empirical studies]] of [[diffusion of innovations]] and the role of R & D, patents, and education.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]] in an [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jewish]] family that spoke [[Russian Language|Russian]] at home.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Alan B|last2=Taylor|first2=Timothy|date=2000-05-01|title=An Interview with Zvi Griliches|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jep.14.2.171|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=171–190|doi=10.1257/jep.14.2.171|issn=0895-3309}}</ref> During [[World War II]] he was sent to the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. In 1947 he emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], where he served in the pre-state [[Israeli army]], learned [[Hebrew]], passed high school equivalence exam, and studied for a year at [[Hebrew University]].  He then moved to the United States, where he earned a [[B.S.]] in Agricultural Economics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and then a Ph.D. in Economics at the [[University of Chicago]], supervised by [[Theodore Schultz]].

In his classic 1957 Ph.D. dissertation, ''Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technological Change'', published as an article in the October 1957 issue of ''[[Econometrica]]'', Griliches demonstrated that the penetration of corn seeds followed the [[logistic curve]]. It was found later through multiple examples by [[Edwin Mansfield]] and other researchers that this is a general rule for [[technological change]] / [[diffusion of innovations]]. The dissertation was one of the first scientific works that treated the development of new technology as an economic phenomenon. Previously, economists had treated it as exogenous.

Most innovations either make production more efficient, or improve the quality of goods. The analysis of measurement of the impact of innovations on economics led Griliches to his fundamental studies of [[economic growth]], [[productivity]], [[production function]], [[consumption function]], measurements of economic input and output, [[hedonic regression|hedonic prices]], and their reflection in [[consumer price index|price indices]].

Griliches also published important works of [[econometrics]], including distributed lags ([[time series]]) and aggregation. He was particularly interested in the measurements of hidden variables.

Griliches served as the President of the [[Econometric Society]] in 1975, and as the President of the [[American Economic Association]] in 1993. From 1969 to 1977 he was one of editors of the journal ''[[Econometrica]]''. He served on the [[Stigler Commission]] in 1961 and the [[Boskin Commission]] in 1996, both of which were convened by the [[United States Senate]] to evaluate the measurement of [[inflation]].

In 1965, Zvi Griliches won the prestigious [[John Bates Clark Medal]]. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1965 and to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1975. He was also elected Distinguished Fellow of the [[American Economic Association]], Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]], Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]], Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and Fellow of the [[American Agricultural Economics Association]]. He died on November 4, 1999, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 2001, in the memory of Zvi Griliches, the International Advisory Board of the [[New Economic School]], with the full approval of the entire NES community, decided to establish an annual series of lectures in economics. “[https://www.nes.ru/pochetnyie-lekczii-pamyati-czvi-grilixesa?lang=en The Zvi Griliches Memorial Lectures]” are presented by leading scholars and open for everyone.
