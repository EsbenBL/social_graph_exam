'''William Halse Rivers Rivers''' [[Royal Society|FRS]] [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|FRAI]] ({{birth date|1864|3|12|df=y}} – {{death date|1922|6|4|df=y}}) was an [[England|English]] [[anthropologist]], [[neurologist]], [[ethnologist]] and [[psychiatrist]], best known for his work treating [[First World War]] officers who were suffering from [[shell shock]] in order to return them to combat.  Rivers' most famous patient was the poet [[Siegfried Sassoon]], with whom he remained close friends until his own sudden death.

During the early years of the 20th century, Rivers developed many new lines of psychological research. In addition, he was the first to use a type of double-blind procedure in investigating physical and psychological effects of consumption of tea, coffee, alcohol, and drugs. For a time he directed centres for psychological studies at two colleges, and he was made a Fellow of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He is also notable for having participated in the [[Torres Strait Islands]] expedition of 1898 and his consequent [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] work on the subject of [[kinship]].

==Biography==

===Family background===

Rivers was born in 1864 at Constitution Hill, [[Chatham, Kent]], son of Elizabeth (née Hunt) (16 October 1834 – 13 November 1897) and Henry Frederick Rivers (7 January 1830 – 9 December 1911).

Records from the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries show the Rivers family to be solidly middle-class, with many [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Church of England]] and [[Royal Navy]] associations.<ref name="slobodin">{{cite book | author = Richard Slobodin | title = W. H. R.

[[Image:Turner, The Battle of Trafalgar (1822).jpg|right|thumb|[[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']]]]

The senior Rivers was the master gunner aboard the ''Victory''. He kept a commonplace book (now held in the [[Royal Naval Museum]] library in [[Portsmouth]]); it has revealed and preserved the thoughts of many of the sailors aboard the ''Victory.''<ref name="trafalgar">{{cite book |author1=Tim Clayton |author2=Phil Craig | title = Trafalgar: The Men, The Battle, The Storm |url=https://archive.org/details/trafalgarmenbatt0000clay |url-access=registration | year = 2004 | publisher = Hodder}}</ref>

His son Midshipman Rivers, who claimed to be "the man who shot the man who fatally wounded Lord Nelson",<ref name="slobodin"/> was a model of heroism in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The seventeen-year-old midshipman nearly lost his foot when it was struck by a grenade; it was attached to him only "by a Piece of Skin abought 4&nbsp;inch above the ankle".<ref name="trafalgar"/>  Rivers asked first for his shoes, then told the gunner's mate to look after the guns, and told [[Captain Hardy]] that he was going down to the cockpit.<ref name="trafalgar"/> He endured the amputation of his leg four inches below the knee, without anaesthetic. According to legend, he did not cry out once during that nor during the consequent sealing of the wound with hot tar.<ref name="trafalgar"/> When Gunner Rivers, anxious about his son's welfare, went to the cockpit to ask after him, his son called out, "Here I am, Father, nothing is the matter with me; only lost my leg and that in a good cause."<ref name="trafalgar"/>

After the battle, the senior Rivers wrote a poem about his remarkable son, entitled "Lines on a Young Gentleman that lost his leg onboard the Victory in the Glorious action at Trafalgar":

{{quote|May every comfort Bless thy future life,

Born to Lieutenant William Rivers, R.N., and his wife, stationed at [[Deptford]],<ref name="slobodin"/> Henry Frederick Rivers followed many family traditions in being educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and entering the church.<ref name="slobodin"/> Having earned his [[B.A|Bachelor of Arts]] in 1857, he was ordained as a [[Church of England]] priest in 1858,<ref name="slobodin"/> and had a career that would span almost 50 years. In 1904, he was forced to tender his resignation due to "infirmities of sight and memory".<ref name="faith's">{{cite book | author = The Council of St. Faith's Church, Maidstone, Kent | title = Minutes of Council Meeting| year = 1904 | location = [[Maidstone, Kent]], Centre for Kentish Studies}}</ref>

[[Image:Offham Church.jpg|left|thumb|Image of the stained glass window of the church in [[Offham, Kent]] where Henry Rivers was curate from 1880 to 1889]]

In 1863, having obtained a curacy at Chatham in addition to a chaplaincy of the Medway Union, Henry Rivers was sufficiently established to marry Elizabeth Hunt, who was living with her brother James in [[Hastings]], not far from Chatham.<ref name="slobodin"/> He was later appointed to curacies in Kent at St Mary's, Chatham (1863-9), Tudeley (1877–80) and Offham (1880-9), and subsequently as Vicar of St Faith's, Maidstone from 1889 to 1904.<ref>''Cambridge University Alumni, 1261-1900'' - A Cambridge Alumni Database (ACAD)</ref>

The Hunts, like the Rivers family, were established with naval and Church of England connections.<ref name="slobodin"/> One of those destined for the pulpit was Thomas (1802–1851), but some quirk of originality set him off into an unusual career.<ref name="slobodin"/>  While an undergraduate at Cambridge, Thomas Hunt had a friend who stammered badly and his efforts to aid the afflicted student led him to leave the university without taking a degree in order to make a thorough study of speech and its defects.<ref name="BoaseODNB">{{cite book | author =G.

Forbes referred pupils to him for twenty-four years.<ref name="BoaseODNB"/>  Hunt's most famous case came about in 1842. George Pearson, the chief witness in a case related to an attempted attack on [[Queen Victoria]] by John Francis, was brought into court but was incapable of giving his evidence. After a fortnight's instruction from Hunt, he spoke easily, a fact certified by the sitting magistrate.<ref name="BoaseODNB"/> Hunt died in 1851, survived by his wife Mary and their two children. His practice was passed on to his son, James.<ref name="Stammer">{{cite book | author =James Hunt | title =Stammering and stuttering, their nature and treatment| publisher = London | year = 1861}}</ref>

James Hunt (1833–1869) was an exuberant character, giving to each of his ventures his boundless energy and self-confidence.<ref name="slobodin"/> Taking up his father's legacy with great zeal, by the age of 21 Hunt had published his compendious work, ''Stammering and Stuttering, Their Nature and Treatment''. This went into six editions during his lifetime and was reprinted again in 1870, just after his death, and for an eighth time in 1967 as a landmark in the history of speech therapy.<ref name="slobodin"/> In the introduction to the 1967 edition of the book, [[Elliot Schaffer]] notes that in his short lifetime, James Hunt is said to have treated over 1,700 cases of speech impediment, firstly in his father's practice and later at his own institute, Ore House near Hastings.<ref name="schaffer">{{cite book |author1=James Hunt |author2=Elliot Schaffer | title = Stammering and stuttering, their nature and treatment|url=https://archive.org/details/stammeringandst01huntgoog | edition = 8th | year = 1967 | publisher = New York: Hafner Publishing Co}}</ref> He set up the latter with the aid of a doctorate he had purchased in 1856 from the [[University of Giessen]] in Germany.<ref name="BrockODNB">{{cite book | author =W. H. Brock | title =Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: James Hunt| publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2004| title-link =Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}</ref>

In later, expanded editions, ''Stammering and Stuttering'' begins to reflect Hunt's growing passion for anthropology exploring, exploring the nature of language usage and speech disorders in non-European peoples.<ref name="slobodin"/> In 1856, Hunt had joined the [[Ethnological Society of London]] and by 1859 he was its joint secretary.<ref name="slobodin"/> But many of the members disliked his attacks on the religious and humanitarian agencies represented by missionaries and the anti-slavery movement.<ref name="BrockODNB"/>

As a result of the antagonism, Hunt founded the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Anthropological Society]] and became its president.<ref name="BrockODNB"/> Nearly 60 years later, his nephew W. He. R. Rivers was selected for this position.<ref name="langham">{{cite book | author =Ian Langham | title =The building of British social anthropology: W. H. R.

Even by Victorian standards, Hunt was a decided racist.<ref name="slobodin"/> His paper "On a Negro's Place in Nature", delivered before the BAAS in 1863, was met with hisses and catcalls.<ref name="BrockODNB"/> What Hunt considered "a statement of the simple facts"<ref name="negro">{{cite book | author =James Hunt | title =On a negro's place in nature| publisher =London: Trübner | year = 1863}}</ref> was thought by others to be a defence of the subjection and slavery of Africans in the Americas, and support of the belief in the plurality of human species.<ref name="BrockODNB"/>

In addition to his extremist views, Hunt led the society to incur heavy debts.<ref name="slobodin"/>  The controversies surrounding his conduct told on his health and, on 29 August 1869, Hunt died of "inflammation of the brain". <!-- Age? -->He was survived by his widow, Henrietta Maria, and five children.<ref name="BrockODNB"/>

His speech therapy practice was passed onto Hunt's brother-in-law, Henry Rivers, who had been working with him for some time.<ref name="BrockODNB"/> Rivers inherited many of Hunt's established patients, most notably The Reverend Charles L.

===Early life===

William Halse Rivers Rivers was the oldest of four children, with his siblings being brother Charles Hay (29 August 1865 – 8 November 1939) and sisters Ethel Marian (30 October 1867 – 4 February 1943) and Katharine Elizabeth (1871–1939).

[[File:Tonbridge School 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Tonbridge School]] where Rivers and his brother Charles were day-boys]]

William, known as "Willie" throughout his childhood,<ref name="slobodin"/> appears to have been named after his famous uncle of ''Victory'' fame; there was also a longstanding family tradition whereby the eldest son of every line would be baptised by that name.<ref name="slobodin"/> The origin of "Halse" is unclear. There may be some naval connection, as it has been suggested that it could have been the name of someone serving alongside his uncle.<ref name="slobodin"/> Slobodin states that it is probable that the second "Rivers" entered his name as a result of a clerical error on the baptismal certificate, but since the register is filled in by his father's hand, and his father performed the ceremony, this seems unlikely.<ref>[[s:Baptismal Record|Copy of Rivers's baptismal certificate]]</ref> Slobodin notes that a mistake on the registry of his birth but his name was changed from the mistaken "William False Rivers Rivers"<ref>[[s: Birth Register|Birth Register of "William False Rivers Rivers"]]</ref> to its later form, with "Halse" as the second name. This suggests that "Rivers" was intended as a given name as well as a surname.

Rivers suffered from a stammer that he never fully conquered. He had no [[sensory memory]], although he was able to visualise to an extent if dreaming, in a half-waking, half-sleeping state, or when feverish.<ref name="instinct">{{cite book | author =W. H. R. Rivers| title = Instinct and the Unconscious| publisher =British Psychological Society | year = 1919}}</ref> Rivers noted that in his early life- specifically before the age of five- his visual imagery was far more definite than it became in later life. He thought it was perhaps as good as that of the average child.<ref name="instinct"/>

At first, Rivers had concluded that his loss of visual imagery had resulted from his lack of attention and interest in it.<ref name="instinct"/>  But, as he later came to realise, while images from his later life frequently faded into obscurity, those from his infancy still remained vivid.<ref name="instinct"/>

As Rivers notes in ''Instinct and the Unconscious'', he was unable to visualise any part of the upper floor of the house he lived in until he was five. By contrast, Rivers was able to describe the lower floors of that particular house with far more accuracy than he had been able to with any house since. Although images of later houses were faded and incomplete, no memory since had been as inaccessible as that of the upper floor of his early home.<ref name="instinct"/>  Given evidence, Rivers came to conclude that something had happened to him on the upper floor of that house, the memory of which was entirely suppressed because it "interfered with [his] comfort and happiness".<ref name="instinct"/> In addition to that specific memory being inaccessible, his sensory memory in general appears to have been severely handicapped from that moment.

{{wikisource|Instinct and the Unconscious}}

If Rivers ever did access the veiled memory, he did not appear to make a note of it. The nature of the experience is open to conjecture. Author [[Pat Barker]], in the second novel of her ''[[Regeneration Trilogy]]'' related to Rivers and his work, ''[[The Eye in the Door]]'', suggested through her character Billy Prior, that Rivers's experience was traumatic enough to cause him to "put his mind's eye out".<ref name="barker2">{{cite book | author =Pat Barker| title = The Eye in the Door| publisher =[[Penguin Books]] | year = 1994}}</ref>

Rivers was a highly able child. Educated first at a Brighton preparatory school and, from the age of thirteen, as a dayboy at the prestigious [[Tonbridge School]], his academic abilities were noted from an early age.<ref name="slobodin"/> At the age of 14, he was placed a year above others of his age at school<ref>The Tonbridge school magazine – ''The Tonbridgian'' – from October 1878 notes that him to be in the IV form, usually reserved for 15 and 16&nbsp;year olds, when he was just 14</ref> and even within this older group he was seen to excel, winning prizes for [[Classics]] and all around attainment.<ref name="TonOct1878">{{cite journal |author=Tonbridge School |date=October 1878|title=Skinners' Day |journal=The Tonbridgian |pages=334–335}}</ref> Rivers's younger brother Charles was also a high achiever at the school; he too was awarded with the Good Work prize.<ref name="TonOct1878"/> He studied and became a [[civil engineer]]. After a bad bout of [[malaria]] contracted whilst in the [[Torres Straits]] with his brother, he was encouraged by the elder Rivers to take up outdoor work.<ref name="slobodin"/>

The teenage Rivers, whilst scholarly, was also involved in other aspects of school life. As the programme for the Tonbridge School sports day notes, on 12 March 1880 – Rivers's sixteenth birthday – he ran in the mile race. The year before this he had been elected as a member of the school debating society, no mean feat for a boy who at this time suffered from a speech impediment which was almost paralytic.<ref name="TonOct1879">{{cite journal |author=Tonbridge School |date=July 1879|title=Debating Society |journal=The Tonbridgian |pages=59}}</ref>

[[Image:Young Rivers.jpg|left|thumb|A young W.H.R Rivers]]

Rivers was set to follow family tradition and take his [[University of Cambridge]] entrance exam, possibly with the aim of studying Classics.<ref name="slobodin"/> But at the age of sixteen, he contracted [[typhoid fever]] and was forced to miss his final year of school.<ref name="Eagle1922">{{cite journal |author=L. E. Shore |year=1922 |title=W. H. R. Rivers |journal=The Eagle |pages=2–12}}</ref> Without the scholarship, his family could not afford to send him to Cambridge. With his typical resilience, Rivers did not dwell on the disappointment.

His illness had been severe, entailing long convalescence and leaving him with effects which at times severely handicapped him.<ref name="Eagle1922"/>  As L. E. Shore notes: "he was not a strong man, and was often obliged to take a few days rest in bed and subsist on a milk diet".<ref name="Eagle1922"/> The severity of the sickness and the shattering of dreams might have broken lesser men but for Rivers in many ways the illness was the making of him. Whilst recovering from the fever, Rivers had formed a friendship with one of his father's speech therapy students, a young Army surgeon. His plan was formed: he would study medicine and apply for training in the Army Medical Department, later to become the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]].<ref name="slobodin"/>

Inspired by this new resolve, Rivers studied medicine at the [[University of London]], where he matriculated in 1882, and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[London]]. He graduated at age 22, the youngest person to do so until recent times.<ref name="slobodin"/>

===Life as a ship's surgeon===

After qualifying, Rivers sought to join the army but was not passed fit. This was a byproduct of typhoid fever. As Elliot Smith was later to write, as quoted in a biography of Rivers: "Rivers always had to fight against ill health: heart and blood vessels." Along with the health problems noted by Shore and Smith, Rivers struggled with "tiring easily".

His sister Katharine wrote that when he came to visit the family, he would often sleep for the first day or two. Considering the volume of work that Rivers completed in his relatively short lifetime, Seligman wrote in 1922 that "for many years he seldom worked for more than four hours a day".<ref name="Geog1922">{{cite journal |author=C. G. Seligman |date=August 1922|title=Obituary: W. H. R. Rivers |journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=60 |pages=162–163}}</ref> As Rivers's biographer [[Richard Slobodin]] says that, "among persons of extraordinary achievement, only [[Descartes]] seems to have put in as short a working day".{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Rivers did not allow his drawbacks to dishearten him,<ref name="Geog1922"/> and he chose to serve several terms as a ship's surgeon, travelling to [[Japan]] and North America in 1887.<ref name="odnb">{{cite book | author = [[Michael Bevan (author)|Michael Bevan]] and [[Jeremy MacClancy]] | year = 2004 | chapter = Rivers, William Halse Rivers  | title = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography }}</ref> This was the first of many voyages; for, besides his great expeditions for work in the [[Torres Straits]] Islands, [[Melanesia]], [[Egypt]], [[India]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], he took holiday voyages twice to the [[West Indies]], three times to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]], to the United States, [[Norway]], and [[Lisbon]], as well as making numerous visits to [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Switzerland]], and lengthy ones to visit family in [[Australia]].<ref name="Eagle1922"/>

Such voyages helped to improve his health, and possibly to prolong his life.<ref name="slobodin"/> He also took a great deal of pleasure from his experiences aboard ship. On one voyage he spent a month in the company of playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]]; he later described how he spent "many hours every day talking – the greatest treat of my life".<ref name="slobodin"/>

==Beginnings of career in psychology==

Back in England, Rivers earned an M.D. (London) and was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]].<ref name="slobodin"/> Soon after, he became house surgeon at the Chichester Infirmary (1887–1889). Although he enjoyed the town and the company of his colleagues,<ref name="slobodin"/> an appointment at Bart's and the opportunity to return to working in research in medicine was more appealing. He became [[Senior house officer|house physician]] at St Bartholomew's in 1889 and remained there until 1890.<ref name="odnb"/>

At Bart's, Rivers had been a physician to [[Samuel Gee|Dr. Samuel Gee]].<ref name="WLB1936">{{cite journal |author=Walter Langdon-Brown |date=November 1936 |title= "To a Very Wise Man": W.H.R Rivers |journal= St. Bartholomew's Hospital Journal |pages=29–30 |author-link= Walter Langdon-Brown}}</ref> Those under Gee were conscious of his indifference towards, if not outright dislike of, the psychological aspects of medicine. [[Walter Langdon-Brown]] surmises that Rivers and his fellow Charles S. Myers devoted themselves to these aspects in reaction to Gee.<ref name="WLB1936"/>

Rivers's interests in neurology and psychology became evident in this period. Reports and papers given by Rivers at the Abernethian Society of St. Bart's indicate a growing specialisationi in these fields: ''Delirium and its allied conditions'' (1889), ''Hysteria'' (1891) and ''Neurasthenia'' (1893).

Following the direction of his passion for the workings of the mind as it correlates with the workings of the body, in 1891 Rivers became house physician at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.<ref name="odnb"/> Here he and [[Henry Head]] met and formed a lasting friendship.<ref name="Head1922">{{cite journal |author=Henry Head|date=June 1922 |title= Obituary: W.H.R Rivers, M.D., D.Sc, F.R.S.: An Appreciation|journal= St. Bartholomew's Hospital Journal |pages=1–3}}</ref>

Rivers's interest in the physiology of the nervous system and in "the mind", that is, in sensory phenomena and mental states,<ref name="slobodin"/> was further stimulated by work in 1891. He was  chosen to be one of [[Victor Horsley]]'s assistants in a series of investigations at [[University College, London]] that explored the existence and nature of electrical currents in the mammalian brain.<ref name="slobodin"/> His selection for this work demonstrated his growing reputation as a researcher.<ref name="slobodin"/>

[[Image:UCL Gower Street.jpg|right|thumb|View of the entrance to [[University College, London]]]]

In the same year, Rivers joined the [[Medical and Chirurgical Society of London|Neurological Society of London]] and presented ''A Case of Treadler's Cramp'' to a meeting of the society. The case demonstrated the ill effects of what is understood as repetitive motion injury. Such injuries sustained by factory workers, against which they had little protection or compensation, were part of the cost for millions of people of Britain's industrial supremacy.<ref name="slobodin"/>

Resigning from the National Hospital in 1892,<ref name="odnb"/> Rivers travelled to [[Jena]] to expand his knowledge of experimental psychology.<ref name="Head1922"/> Whilst in Jena, Rivers became fluent in German and attended lectures on both psychology and philosophy.<ref name="slobodin"/> He also became deeply immersed in the culture; in a diary he kept of the journey he comments on the buildings, picture galleries, church services, and education system, showing his wide interests and critical judgement.<ref name="Eagle1922"/> In this diary he also wrote that: "I have during the last three weeks come to the conclusion that I should go in for insanity when I return to England and work as much as possible at psychology."<ref name="slobodin"/>

After his return to England, he became a Clinical Assistant at the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]. In 1893, at the request of G. H Savage, he began assisting with lectures in mental diseases at [[Guy's Hospital]], emphasising their psychological aspect. At about the same time, invited by Professor Sully, he began to lecture on experimental psychology at [[University College, London]].<ref name=":0">From C. S. Myers's "Presidential Address" (1922), to the Psychology Section of the British Association. The address is included in Rivers's posthumously published ''Psychology and Politics'' (1923).</ref>

By 1893, when he was unexpectedly invited to lecture in Cambridge on the functions of the sense organs, he was already deeply read in the subject.<ref name="Head1922"/> He had been captivated by Head's accounts of the works of [[Ewald Hering]], and had avidly absorbed his views on colour vision and the nature of vital processes in living matter.<ref name="Head1922"/> He also prepared for this project by spending the summer working in [[Heidelberg]] with [[Emil Kraepelin]] on measuring the effects of fatigue.<ref name="odnb"/>

The offer of a Cambridge lectureship resulted from continuing evolution within the university's [[Natural Science]] [[Tripos]]. Earlier in 1893, Professor McKendrick, of [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], had examined subject and reported unfavourably on the scant knowledge of the special senses that was displayed by the candidates;<ref name="WLB1936"/> to correct this, [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Sir Michael Foster]]appointed Rivers as a lecturer. He became Fellow Commoner at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]].<ref name="WLB1936"/><ref>A "Fellow Commoner" is a student, or, in this case, lecturer, at the [[University of Cambridge]] who is given the right to "common", or dine, at the Fellow's table.</ref> He was made a [[Fellow]] of the college in 1902.<ref>{{acad|id=RVRS893WH|name=Rivers, William Halse Rivers}}</ref>

Rivers was stretched in his work, as he still had ongoing teaching commitments at Guy's hospital and at University College.<ref name="slobodin"/> In addition to these mounting responsibilities, in 1897 he was put in temporary charge of the new psychological laboratory at University College. That year Foster had assigned him a room in the Physiology Department at Cambridge for use in psychological research. As a result, Rivers is listed in the histories of experimental psychology as simultaneously the director of the first two psychological laboratories in Britain.<ref name="slobodin"/>

Rivers's work has been considered to have profound influence on Cambridge and in the scientific world in general. But, at the time, the Cambridge University Senate were wary of his appointment. [[Frederic Bartlett|Bartlett]] wrote: "how many times have I heard Rivers, spectacles waving in the air, his face lit by his transforming smile, tell how, in Senatorial discussion, an ancient orator described him as a 'Ridiculous Superfluity'!"<ref name="ajop50"/>

The opposition of the Senate resulted in limited support for Rivers's work in its early years.<ref name="slobodin"/> It was not until 1901, eight years after his appointment, that he was allowed the use of a small cottage for the laboratory, and budgeted thirty-five pounds annually (later increased to fifty) for purchase and upkeep of equipment.<ref name="slobodin"/>  For several years Rivers continued in this way until the Moral Science Board increased support;<ref name="ajop50"/> in 1903, Rivers and his assistants and students moved to another small building in [[St Tibbs Row]].<ref name="ajop50"/> These working spaces were characterised as "dismal", "damp, dark and ill-ventilated"<ref name="EB1957">{{cite book | author = Edwin Boring | title = A History of Experimental Psychology | year = 1957 | publisher = New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts}}</ref>  but they did not discourage the Cambridge psychologists. Psychology began to thrive: "perhaps, in the early days of scientific progress, a subject often grows all the more surely if its workers have to meet difficulties, improvise their apparatus, and rub very close shoulders one with another."<ref name="ajop50"/> In 1912 a well-equipped laboratory was finally built under the directorship of Charles S. Myers, one of Rivers's earliest and ablest pupils. A wealthy man, he supplemented the university grant with his own funds.<ref name="slobodin"/>

[[Image:My Cross Country Pictures 122.jpg|left|thumb|View of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]]]
The Cambridge psychologists and Rivers were initially most interested in the special senses: colour vision, optical illusions, sound-reactions, and perceptual processes.<ref name="ajop50"/> In these fields, Rivers was rapidly becoming eminent. He was invited to write a chapter on vision for Schäfer's ''Handbook of Physiology''. According to Bartlett, Rivers's chapter "still remains, from a psychological point of view, one of the best in the English Language".<ref name="ACH-FB1922">{{cite journal |author1=A.C Haddon |author2=F.C Bartlett |date=July 1922 |title= William Halse Rivers Rivers, M.D., F.R.S., President of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Born 1864, Died June 4, 1922|journal= [[Man Journal|Man]] |volume=22 |pages=97–104}}</ref> Rivers reviewed the work of previous investigators, incorporated his own, and critically examined the rival theories of colour vision. He noted clearly the significance of psychological factors in, for instance, the phenomena of contrast.<ref name="Eagle1922"/>

For his own experiments on vision, Rivers worked with graduate medical students [[Charles S. Myers]] and [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]. They assisted him and developed close friendships in the process of working together.<ref name="slobodin"/> Rivers also collaborated with [[Sir Horace Darwin]], a pioneer instrument maker, to improve apparatus for recording sensations, especially those involved in vision. This collaboration also resulted in a lifelong friendship between the two men.<ref name="slobodin"/>

In this period, Rivers also investigated the influence of stimulants: tea, [[coffee]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and a number of other drugs, on a person's capacity for both physical and mental work. His work under Kraepelin at [[Heidelberg]] had prepared him for this work. Rivers conducted some experiments on himself, for instance for two years giving up alcoholic beverages and tobacco, neither of which he liked, but also giving up all tea, coffee and cocoa as well.<ref name="Eagle1922"/> Initially he intended to explore physiological incentives for consuming these products, but he quickly realized that a strong psychological influence contributed to taking the substances.<ref name="Rivers-Webber">{{cite journal |author1=W.H.R Rivers |author2=H.N Webber |year=1906 |title=The influence of small doses of alcohol on the capacity for muscular work |journal= The British Journal of Psychology |volume=2 |pages=261–280}}</ref>

Rivers realised that part of the effects- mental and physical- that substances had were caused psychologically by the excitement of knowing that one is indulging.<ref name="Rivers-Webber"/> In order, to eliminate "all possible effects of suggestion, sensory stimulation and interest", Rivers ensured that the substances were disguised so that he could not ascertain, in any instance, whether he was taking a drug or a control substance.<ref name="Rivers-Webber"/><ref>Owing to the distinctive taste of alcohol, it was necessary for the control mixture to be able to disguise the taste. The mixture used was one containing [[capsicum]], [[cardamom]]s, [[chloroform]] and [[peppermint]].</ref> This was the first experiment of its kind to use this double-blind procedure.<ref name="slobodin"/> As a result of the importance attached to the study, Rivers was appointed in 1906 as [[Croonian Lecture]]r to the Royal College of Physicians.<ref name="ACH-FB1922"/>

In December 1897 Rivers's achievements were recognised by the University of Cambridge who honoured him with the degree of M.A. ''[[honorary degree|honoris causa]]''<ref name="ACH-FB1922"/> and, in 1904 with the assistance of [[James Ward (psychologist)|Professor James Ward]], Rivers made a further mark on the world of psychological sciences, founding and subsequently editing the [[British Journal of Psychology]].<ref name="ajop36"/>

Despite his many successes, Rivers was still a markedly reticent man in mixed company, hampered as he was by his stammer and innate shyness.<ref name="WLB1936"/> In 1897, Langdon-Brown invited Rivers to come and address the Abernethian Society. The occasion was not an unqualified success. He chose "Fatigue" as his subject, and before he had finished his title was writ large on the faces of his audience.<ref name="WLB1936"/> In the Cambridge physiological laboratory too he had to lecture to a large elementary class. He was rather nervous about it, and did not like it,<ref name="Eagle1922"/> his hesitation of speech made his style dry and he had not yet acquired the art of expressing his original ideas in an attractive form, except in private conversation.<ref name="WLB1936"/>

Among two or three friends, however, the picture of Rivers is quite different. His conversations were full of interest and illumination;<ref name="WLB1936"/> "he was always out to elicit the truth, entirely sincere, and disdainful of mere dialect."<ref name="WLB1936"/> His insistence on veracity made him a formidable researcher, as Haddon puts it, "the keynote of Rivers was thoroughness. Keenness of thought and precision marked all his work."<ref name="ACH-FB1922"/> His research was distinguished by a fidelity to the demands of experimental method very rare in the realms which he was exploring<ref name="ACH-FB1922"/> and, although often overlooked, the work that Rivers did in this early period is of immense import as it formed the foundation of all that came later.<ref name="ACH-FB1922"/>

==Torres Straits Expedition==
Rivers recognised in himself "the desire for change and novelty, which is one of the strongest aspects of my mental makeup"<ref name=ConflictDream>{{cite book|title=Conflict and Dreams|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.106714|first1=W.

The turning point came in 1898 when [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] seduced "Rivers from the path of virtue... (for psychology then was a chaste science)... into that of anthropology:"<ref>From a speech made after Haddon had been presented with the first Rivers Medal by the Royal Anthropological Institute on 27 January 1925– quoted in Langham, 1981</ref> He made Rivers first choice to head an expedition to the [[Torres Straits]].<ref name="langham"/> Rivers's first reaction was to decline, but he soon agreed on learning that [[C.S Myers]] and [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]], two of his best former students, would participate.<ref name="langham"/> The other members were [[Sidney Herbert Ray|Sidney Ray]], [[Charles Gabriel Seligman|C.G Seligman]], and a young Cambridge graduate named Anthony Wilkin, who was asked to accompany the expedition as photographer.<ref name="langham"/> In April 1898, the Europeans were transported with gear and apparatus to the Torres Straits.  Rivers was said to pack only a small handbag of personal effects for such field trips.<ref name="slobodin"/>

From [[Thursday Island]], several of the party found passage, soaked by rain and waves, on the deck of a crowded 47-foot [[ketch]]. In addition to sea sickness, Rivers had been badly sunburnt on his shins and for many days had been quite ill. On 5 May, in a bad storm nearing their first destination of [[Murray Island, Queensland|Murray Island]], the ship dragged anchor on the [[Great Barrier Reef|Barrier Reef]] and the expedition almost met disaster<ref name="slobodin"/> Later Rivers recalled the [[palliative effect]] of near shipwreck.<ref>''Instinct and the Unconscious'': "Not only may an injury occurring in the presence of danger fail wholly to be perceived, but the pain already present may completely disappear, even if it depends upon definite organic changes. On one occasion I was in imminent danger of shipwreck while suffering from severe inflammation of the skin over the shin-bones, consequent upon sun-burn, which made every movement painful. So long as the danger was present I moved about freely, quite oblivious to the state of my legs, and wholly free from pain. There was also striking absence of the fear I should have expected the incident to produce."</ref>

When the ketch dropped anchor, Rivers and Ray were at first too ill to go ashore. However the others set up a surgery to treat the native islanders and Rivers, lying in bed next-door tested the patients for [[colour vision]]: Haddon's diary noted "He is getting some interesting results."<ref name="slobodin"/> The warmth shown to the sickly Rivers by the Islanders contributed to strong positive feelings for the work and a deep concern for the welfare of Melanesians during the remainder of his life."<ref name="slobodin"/>

Rivers's first task was to examine first hand the colour vision of the islanders and compare it to that of Europeans.<ref name="langham"/><ref name="J.LMyers1923">{{cite journal |author=J.L Myers |date=January–June 1923 |title= W. H. R. Rivers |journal= Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=53 |pages=14–17 |doi=10.2307/2843748 |jstor=2843748}}</ref> In the course of his examinations of the visual acuity of the natives, Rivers showed that colour-blindness did not exist or was very rare, but that the colour vision of Papuans was not the same type as that of Europeans; they possessed no word for blue, and an intelligent native found nothing unnatural in applying the same name to the brilliant blue sea or sky and to the deepest black.<ref name="RoyalSoc1922">{{cite journal |author=Henry Head |date=January–June 1922 |title= W. H. R. Rivers |journal= Obituary Notices from the Proceedings of the Royal Society }}</ref>  "Moreover," Head goes on to state in Rivers's obituary notice, "he was able to explode to old fallacy that the 'noble savage' was endowed with powers of vision far exceeding that of civilised natives. Errors of refraction are, it is true, less common, especially myopia. But, altogether the feats of the Torres Straits islanders equalled those reported by travellers from other parts of the world, they were due to the power of attending to minute details in familiar and strictly limited surrounding, and not to supernormal visual acuity."<ref name="RoyalSoc1922"/>

It was at this point that Rivers began collecting family histories and constructing genealogical tables<ref name="RoyalSoc1922"/> but at this point his purpose appears to have been more biological than ethnological since such tables seem to have originated as a means of determining whether certain sensory talents or disabilities were hereditary.<ref name="A.C.HNature1922">{{cite journal |author=A.C Haddon |date=June 1922 |title= Dr. W. H. R. Rivers, F.R.S |journal= Nature |volume=109 |pages=786–787 |doi=10.1038/109786a0 |issue=2746|bibcode=1922Natur.109..786H |doi-access=free }}</ref> However, these simple tables soon took on a new prospective.

It was at once evident to Rivers that "the names applied to the various forms of blood relationship did not correspond to those used by Europeans, but belonged to what is known as a 'classificatory system'; a man's 'brothers' or 'sisters' might include individuals we should call cousins and the key to this nomenclature is to be found in forms of social organisation especially in varieties of the institution of marriage."<ref name="RoyalSoc1922"/> Rivers found that relationship terms were used to imply definite duties, privileges and mutual restrictions in conduct, rather than being biologically based as ours are. As Head puts it: "all these facts were clearly demonstrable by the genealogical method, a triumphant generalisation which has revolutionised ethnology."<ref name="RoyalSoc1922"/>

The Torres Straits expedition was "revolutionary" in many other respects as well. For the first time, British anthropology had been removed from its "armchair" and placed into a sound empirical basis, providing the model for future anthropologists to follow.<ref name="langham"/> In 1916, Sir Arthur Keith stated in an address to the Royal Anthropological Institute, that the expedition had engendered "the most progressive and profitable movement in the history of British anthropology."<ref name="langham"/>

While the expedition was clearly productive and, in many ways, arduous for its members, it was also the foundation of lasting friendships. The team would reunite at many points and their paths would frequently converge. Of particular note is the relationship between Rivers and Haddon, the latter of whom regarded the fact he had induced Rivers to come to the Torres Straits as his claim to fame.<ref name="Man1940">{{cite journal |author1=A.H. Quiggin |author2=E.S. Fegan |year=1940 |title= Alfred Cort Haddon |journal= Man }}</ref> It cannot be denied that both Rivers and Haddon were serious about their work but at the same time they were imbued with a keen sense of humour and fun. Haddon's diary from Tuesday 16 August reads thus: "Our friends and acquaintances would often be very much amused if they could see us at some of our occupations and I am afraid these would sometimes give occasion to the enemy to blaspheme – so trivial would they appear ... for example one week we were mad on [[Cat's cradle]] – at least Rivers, Ray and I were – McDougall soon fell victim and even Myers eventually succumbed."<ref name="langham"/> It may seem to be a bizarre occupation for a group of highly qualified men of science, indeed, as Haddon states: "I can imagine that some people would think we were demented – or at least wasting our time."<ref name="langham"/> However, both Haddon and Rivers were to use the string trick to scientific ends<ref>Rivers saw string figures as throwing light on protopathic, as opposed to epicritic, mental processes (for more on this, see Rivers's review of ''String Figures'' by Caroline Jayne in ''Folklore'' '''18'''- 1907). For Haddon, producing string figures became an unequalled means of winning the confidence of informants. After all, as his daughter Kathleen wrote, "who would suspect the guile of a man who sits among the children playing with a piece of string?"(Langham, 1981)</ref> and they are also credited as inventing a system of nomenclature that enabled them to be able to schematise the steps required and teach a variety of string tricks to European audiences.<ref name="langham"/>

The expedition ended in October 1898 and Rivers returned to England."<ref name="Eagle1922"/> In 1900, Rivers joined Myers and Wilkin in Egypt to run tests on the colour vision of the Egyptians; this was the last time he saw Wilkin, who died of [[dysentery]] in May 1901, aged 24.<ref name="slobodin"/><ref>Rivers and Haddon established the Wilkin Studentship at Cambridge in the young man's honour</ref>

===The Todas===
Rivers had already formed a career in physiology and psychology. But now he moved more definitively into anthropology. He wanted a demographically small, fairly isolated people, comparable to the island societies of the Torres Strait, where he might be able to get genealogical data on each and every individual. The Todas in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, with their population then about 700 plus, suited Rivers's criteria. And they had specific features of social organization, such as polyandrous marriage and a bifurcation of their society into so-called moieties that had interested historical evolutionists. Whether his fieldwork was initially so single-minded is questionable, however, since at first he looked at other local communities and studied their visual perception before fixing all his attention on the Todas.

Rivers worked among the Todas for less than six months during 1901–02, communicating with his Toda informants only through interpreters and lodged in an Ootacamund hotel. Yet he assembled a stunning collection of data on the ritual and social lives of the Toda people. Almost all who have subsequently studied the Todas have been amazed at the richness and the accuracy of Rivers's data. His book, "The Todas", which came out in 1906, is still an outstanding contribution to Indian ethnography, "indispensable: still only to be supplemented rather than superseded", as Murray Emeneau wrote in 1971. And it is little wonder that so famous a champion of anthropological fieldwork as Dr Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) declared Rivers to be his "patron saint of field work".

In the preface to this book Rivers wrote that his work was "not merely the record of the customs and beliefs of a people, but also the demonstration of anthropological method". That method is the collection of genealogical materials for the purpose of more fully investigating other aspects of social life, notably ritual. 
 
The first eleven chapters of "The Todas" represented in 1906 a novel approach to the presentation of ethnographic data, one that, under the influence of Malinowski, would later become a standard practice in British social anthropology. This is the analysis of a people's society and culture by presentation of a detailed description of a particularly significant institution. In the Toda case, it is the sacred dairy cult. But Rivers is unable to sustain this focus throughout the work, so after a brilliant opening, the book tails off somewhat. We get a good idea of the Toda dairies and the ideas of ritual purity that protect them; but then the author returns to the ready-made categories of the day: gods, magic, kinship, clanship, crime and so on, and says no more about the dairies. Moreover, he failed to discover the existence of matrilineal clans alongside the patrilineal ones. A second, and more important, limitation of his study is its failure to view Toda society as a local and specialized variant of—as A.L. Kroeber wrote—"higher Indian culture". Rivers's book has been largely responsible for the view (now not infrequently held by educated Todas themselves) that these are a people quite distinct from other South Indians.

When, in 1902, Rivers left the Nilgiri Hills and India too, he would never return. Moreover, after the publication of "The Todas" he wrote very little more about them.

=="A Human Experiment in Nerve Division"==

Upon his return to England from the Torres Strait, Rivers became aware of a series of experiments being conducted by his old friend Henry Head in conjunction with James Sherren, a surgeon at the London Hospital where they both worked.<ref name="langham"/> Since 1901, the pair had been forming a systematic study of nerve injuries among patients attending the hospital.<ref name="langham"/> Rivers, who had long been interested in the physiological consequences of nerve division,<ref name="Head1922"/> was quick to take on the role of "guide and counsellor".<ref name="NerveDivision">{{cite journal |author=W.H.R Rivers and [[Henry Head]] |year=1908 |title= A Human Experiment in Nerve Division |journal= Brain |volume= 31 | issue=3 |pages= 323–450 |doi=10.1093/brain/31.3.323|title-link=s:A Human Experiment in Nerve Division }}</ref>

It quickly became clear to Rivers, looking in on the experiment from a psycho-physical aspect, that the only way accurate results could be obtained from introspection on behalf of the patient is if the subject under investigation was himself a trained observer, sufficiently discriminative to realise if his introspection was being prejudiced by external irrelevancies or moulded by the form of the experimenter's questions, and sufficiently detached to lead a life of detachment throughout the entire course of the tests.<ref name="langham"/> It was in the belief that he could fulfil these requirements, that Head himself volunteered to act, as Langham puts it, "as Rivers's experimental guinea-pig."<ref name="langham"/>

So it was that, on 25 April 1903, the radial and external cutaneous nerves of Henry Head's arm were severed and sutured.<ref name="NerveDivision"/> Rivers was then to take on the role of examiner and chart the regeneration of the nerves, considering the structure and functions of the nervous system from an evolutionary standpoint through a series of "precise and untiring observations" over a period of five years.<ref name="Head1922"/>

{{wikisource|A human experiment in nerve division}}

At first observation, the day after the operation, the back of Head's hand and the dorsal surface of his thumb were seen to be "completely insensitive to stimulation with cotton wool, to pricking with a pin, and to all degrees of heat and cold."<ref name="NerveDivision"/> While cutaneous sensibility had ceased, deep sensibility was maintained so that pressure with a finger, a pencil or with any blunt object was appreciated without hesitation.<ref name="NerveDivision"/>

So that the distractions of a busy life should not interfere with Head's introspective analysis, it was decided that the experimentation should take place in Rivers's rooms.<ref name="NerveDivision"/> Here, as Head states, "for five happy years we worked together on week-ends and holidays in the quiet atmosphere of his rooms at St. John's College."<ref name="RoyalSoc1922"/> In the normal course of events, Head would travel to Cambridge on Saturday, after spending several hours on the outpatient department of the London Hospital. On these occasions, however, he would find that he was simply too exhausted to work on the Saturday evening so experimentation would have to be withheld until the Sunday. If, therefore, a long series of tests were to be carried out, Head would come to Cambridge on the Friday, returning to London on Monday morning. At some points, usually during Rivers's vacation period, longer periods could be devoted to the observations.<ref name="RoyalSoc1922"/> Between the date of the operation and their last sitting on 13 December 1907, 167&nbsp;days were devoted to the investigation.<ref name="RoyalSoc1922"/>

Since Head was simultaneously collaborator and experimental subject, extensive precautions were taken to make sure that no outside factors influenced his subjective appreciation of what he was perceiving:<ref name="langham"/> "No questions were asked until the termination of a series of events; for we found it was scarcely possible... to ask even simple questions without giving a suggestion either for or against the right answer... The clinking of ice against the glass, the removal of the kettle from the hob, tended to prejudice his answers... [Rivers] was therefore particularly careful to make all his preparations beforehand; the iced tubes were filled and jugs of hot and cold water ranged within easy reach of his hand, so that the water of the temperature required might be mixed silently."<ref name="NerveDivision"/>

Moreover, although before each series of tests Head and Rivers would discuss their plan of action, Rivers was careful to vary this order to such an extent during the actual testing that Head would be unable to tell what was coming next.<ref name="NerveDivision"/>

Gradually during the course of the investigation, certain isolated spots of cutaneous sensibility began to appear; these spots were sensitive to heat, cold and pressure.<ref name="NerveDivision"/> However, the spaces between these spots remained insensitive at first,  unless sensations- such as heat or cold- reached above a certain threshold at which point the feeling evoked was unpleasant and usually perceived as being "more painful" than it was if the same stimulus was applied to Head's unaffected arm.<ref name="NerveDivision"/> Also, although the sensitive spots were quite definitely localised, Head, who sat through the tests with his eyes closed, was unable to gain any exact appreciation of the locus of stimulation.<ref name="langham"/> Quite the contrary, the sensations radiated widely, and Head tended to refer them to places remote from the actual point of stimulation.<ref name="NerveDivision"/>

[[Image:Experiment in nerve division 1903-1907.JPG|left|frame|[[Henry Head]] and W. H. R. Rivers experimenting in Rivers's rooms (1903–1907)]]

This was the first stage of the recovery process and Head and Rivers dubbed it the "protopathic",<ref name="NerveDivision"/> taking its origins from the [[Middle Greek]] word ''protopathes'', meaning "first affected".<ref name="langham"/> This protopathic stage seemed to be marked by an "all-or-nothing" aspect since there was either an inordinate response to sensation when compared with normal reaction or no reaction whatever if the stimulation was below the threshold.<ref name="NerveDivision"/>

Finally, when Head was able to distinguish between different temperatures and sensations below the threshold, and when he could recognise when two compass points were applied simultaneously to the skin, Head's arm began to enter the second stage of recovery.<ref name="NerveDivision"/> They named this stage the "epicritic", from the Greek ''epikritikos'', meaning "determinative".<ref name="langham"/>

From an evolutionary perspective, it soon became clear to Rivers that the [[Cutaneous innervation#Types of sensory neurons|epicritic nervous reaction]] was the superior, as it suppressed and abolished all protopathic sensibility.<ref name="NerveDivision"/> This, Rivers found, was the case in all parts of the skin of the male anatomy except one area where protopathic sensibility is unimpeded by epicritic impulses: the [[glans penis]].<ref name="NerveDivision"/> As Langham points out, with special references to "Rivers's reputed sexual proclivities",<ref>Langham also finds it of interest, in lieu of Rivers's sexual leanings, that the only internal area of protopathic sensitivity the investigators were to find was that of the lower alimentary canal (see Head, Rivers and Sherren, "The Afferent Nervous System from a New Aspect", ''Brain'' '''28'''- 1905)</ref> it is at this point that the experiment takes on an almost farcical aspect to the casual reader.<ref name="langham"/> It may not seem surprising to us that when Rivers was to apply a needle to a particularly sensitive part of the glans that "pain appeared and was so excessively unpleasant that [Head] cried out and started away";<ref name="NerveDivision"/> indeed, such a test could be seen as a futility verging on the masochistic. Nor would we necessarily equate the following passage with what one might normally find in a scientific text:

"The foreskin was drawn back, and the penis allowed to hang downwards. A number of drinking glasses were prepared containing water at different temperatures. [Head] stood with his eyes closed, and [Rivers] gradually approached one of the glasses until the surface of the water covered the glans but did not touch the foreskin. Contact with the fluid was not appreciated; if, therefore, the temperature of the water was such that it did not produce a sensation of heat or cold, Head was unaware that anything had been done."<ref name="NerveDivision"/>

However, the investigations, bizarre as they may seem, did have a sound scientific basis since Rivers especially was looking at the protopathic and epicritic from an evolutionary perspective.<ref name="NerveDivision"/> From this standpoint it is intensely interesting to note that the male anatomy maintains one area which is "unevolved" in so much as it is "associated with a more primitive form of sensibility".<ref name="NerveDivision"/> Using this information about the protopathic areas of the human body, Rivers and Head then began to explore elements of man's psyche.<ref name="langham"/> One way in which they did this was to examine the [[Goose bumps|"pilomoter reflex"]] (the erection of hairs). Head and Rivers noted that the thrill evoked by aesthetic pleasure is "accompanied by the erection of hairs"<ref name="NerveDivision"/> and they noted that this reaction was no greater in the area of skin with protopathic sensibility than it was in the area of the more evolved epicritic, making it a purely psychologically based phenomena.<ref name="NerveDivision"/> As Langham puts it: "The image of a man reading a poem to evoke aesthetic pleasure while a close friend meticulously studies the erection of his hairs may seem ludicrous. However, it provides a neat encapsulation of Rivers's desire to subject possibly protopathic phenomena to the discipline of rigorous investigation."<ref name="langham"/>

 }}</ref> By degrees he became more absorbed in anthropological research. But though he was now an ethnologist rather than a psychologist he always maintained that what was of value in his work was due directly to his training in the psychological laboratory. In the laboratory he had learnt the importance of exact method; in the field he now gained vigour and vitality by his constant contact with the actual daily behaviour of human beings.

During 1907–8 Rivers travelled to [[Solomon Islands|the Solomon Islands]], and other areas of [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]. His two-volume ''History of Melanesian Society'' (1914), which he dedicated to St Johns,<ref name="HistMel"/>   presented a diffusionist thesis for the development of culture in the south-west Pacific.<ref name="odnb"/> In the year of publication he made a second journey to Melanesia, returning to England in March 1915, to find that war had broken out.

==The Great War==

When Rivers returned to England in spring 1915, he had trouble at first finding a place for himself in the war effort.<ref name=":0" /> Following the footsteps of his former student—the current director of the Cambridge Psychology Laboratory—[[Charles S Myers|C.S. Myers]], the 51-year-old W.H.R. Rivers signed up to serve as a civilian physician at the [[Maghull Military Hospital]] near Liverpool.<ref name="slobodin" /> Upon his arrival in July 1915, Rivers was appointed as a psychiatrist and thus he re-entered into the study of "insanity."<ref name="slobodin" />

"Insanity" in this case entailed working with soldiers who had been diagnosed as suffering from any of a wide range of symptoms, which were collectively referred to as "[[shell shock]]." These soldiers were known to demonstrate symptoms such as temporary blindness, memory loss, paralysis, and uncontrollable crying.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Europe Since 1914: Encyclopedia of the Age of War and Reconstruction|publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons|year = 2006|location = Detroit, MI|chapter-url = http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=68e38a773150a58e15b8ce0ae86c33fa&action=2&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CCX3447000901&userGroupName=mlin_m_cambrls&jsid=610181483d9a5e64da4b8aa0cd26a8a5|chapter = War Neuroses|editor-last = Merriman|editor-first = John|volume = 5|editor-last2 = Winter|editor-first2 = Jay|pages = 2699–2705}}</ref> As such, by the time W.H.R. Rivers was assigned to Maghull War Hospital, it was known as the "centre for abnormal psychology," and many of its physicians were employing techniques such as dream interpretation, psychoanalysis and hypnosis to treat shell shock, also known as the war neuroses.<ref name="slobodin" />

Rivers himself was a well-read psychologist and so was already quite familiar with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], and other [[Psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalysts]].<ref name="slobodin" /> In fact, Rivers was quite sympathetic to some of Freud's ideas.<ref name=":0" /> As such, Rivers joined the band of doctors at Maghull who devoted themselves to understanding the origins and treatment of the "war neuroses" under the guidance of R.G.

After about a year of service at Maghull War Hospital, Rivers was appointed a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], and his two youthful dreams—to be an army doctor and to "go in for insanity"—were realized when he was transferred to [[Craiglockhart War Hospital]] near [[Edinburgh]], Scotland in order to help "clean house" following a scandal.<ref name="slobodin" /><ref name=":0" /> There, Rivers treated officers who had been diagnosed with "shell shock," and he also began formulating his theory regarding the origin and treatment of the war neuroses. {{quote|Rivers, by pursuing a course of humane treatment, had established two principles that would be embraced by American military psychiatrists in the [[World War II|next war]].

[[Image:rivers2.jpg|left|frame|W. H. R. Rivers outside Craiglockhart]]

Rivers's methodology for treating the war neuroses are often, and somewhat unfairly, said to have stemmed from [[Sigmund Freud]]. While it is true that Rivers was aware of and was influenced by Freud's theories and by the practice of psychoanalysis, he did not blindly subscribe to all of Freud's premises.<ref name="slobodin" /><ref name="instinct" /> Most importantly, Rivers saw the instinct of [[self-preservation]] rather than the sexual instinct, as the driving force behind war neuroses.<ref name="instinct" /><ref>{{cite journal | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/history_workshop_journal/v058/58.1raitt.html | last = Raitt | first = Suzanne

It is on this belief regarding the origins of the war neuroses that he formed his "talking cure." Rivers' "talking cure" was primarily based on the ancient belief of [[catharsis]]: the idea that bringing repressed memories into the light of consciousness rids memories and thoughts of their power.<ref name=":2" /> As a result, Rivers spent most of his days talking with the officers at Craiglockhart, guiding them through a process Rivers referred to as autogonosis.<ref name="slobodin" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title = Modern nostalgia: Siegfried Sassoon, trauma and the Second World War I|last = Hemmings|first = Robert|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|year = 2008|location = Edinburgh|pages = 54–55|chapter = Witnessing and survival: The challenge of 'autogonosis' in the interwar years}}</ref> Rivers' autogonosis consisted of two parts. The first part included "re-education," or educating the patient about the basics of [[psychology]] and [[physiology]]. River's method also consisted of helping a soldier comprehend that the illness he was experiencing was not "strange" nor permanent.<ref name="slobodin" /><ref name=":2" /> To Rivers, the war neuroses developed from ingrained ways of reacting, feeling, or thinking: namely, the attempt to wittingly [[Repression (psychological)|repress]] all memories of traumatic experiences or unacceptable emotions.<ref name=":2" />  Once a patient could understand the source(s) of his troubles (which could be conscious, unconscious, environmental, or a combination), Rivers could then help him contrive ways to overcome these patterns and thus free himself from and/or at least adjust to the illness.<ref name="slobodin" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

Rivers' approach to treating the war neuroses made him a pioneer in his day; while he was not the first to advocate humane treatment methods for the war neuroses,<ref name=":1" /> he was one of the few to do so in a time when there was much debate over the cause and thus the "correct" treatment for [[shell shock]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Report of the War Office Committee of enquiry into "shell shock|publisher = Imperial War Museum|year = 1922|location = London|edition = 2004}}</ref> (See the Wikipedia article on [[Lewis Yealland]] and faradization for an alternative treatment method.)  Furthermore, Rivers encouraged his patients to express their emotions in a time when society encouraged men to keep a "stiff upper-lip." River's method, and his deep concern for every individual he treated, made him famous among his clients. Both [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[Robert Graves]] wrote highly of him during this time.<ref name="slobodin" /><ref name=":3" />

=== Rivers and Sassoon ===
Sassoon came to Rivers in 1917 after publicly protesting against the war and refusing to return to his regiment, but was treated with sympathy and given much leeway until he voluntarily returned to France.<ref>{{cite book | first = Max | last = Egremont | title = Siegfried Sassoon: a Life | url = https://archive.org/details/siegfriedsassoon0000egre | url-access = registration | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-374-26375-2 }}</ref> For Rivers, there was a considerable dilemma involved in "curing" his patients simply in order that they could be sent back to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to die. Rivers's feelings of guilt are clearly portrayed both in fiction and in fact. Through Pat Barker's novels and in Rivers's works (particularly ''Conflict and Dream'') we get a sense of the turmoil the doctor went through. As Sassoon wrote in a letter to Robert Graves (24 July 1918):

{{quote|O Rivers please take me. And make me<br>Go back to the war til it break me...}}

Rivers did not wish to "break" his patients, but at the same time he knew that it was their duty to return to the front and his duty to send them. There is also an implication (given the pun on Rivers's name along with other factors) that Rivers was more to Sassoon than just a friend.  Sassoon called him "father confessor", a point that [[Jean Moorcroft Wilson]] picks up on in her biography of Sassoon; however, Rivers's tight morals would have probably prevented a closer relationship from progressing:

{{quote|Rivers's uniform was not the only constraint in their relationship. He was almost certainly homosexual by inclination and it must quickly have become clear to him that Sassoon was too. Yet neither is likely to have referred to it, though we know that Sassoon was already finding his sexuality a problem. At the same time, as an experienced psychologist Rivers could reasonably expect Sassoon to experience "transference" and become extremely fond of him. [[Paul Fussell]] suggests in ''[[The Great War and Modern Memory]]'' ({{ISBN|0195019180}}) that Rivers became the embodiment of the male "dream friend" who had been the companion of Sassoon's boyhood fantasies. Sassoon publicly acknowledged that "there was never any doubt about my liking [Rivers]. He made me feel safe at once, and seemed to know all about me".

But Sassoon's description of the doctor in ''Sherston's Progress'', lingering as it does on Rivers's warm smile and endearing habits – he often sat, spectacles pushed up on forehead, with his hands clasped around one knee – suggests that it was more than liking he felt. And privately he was rather franker, telling Marsh, whom he knew would understand, that he "loved [Rivers] at first sight".}}

Not only Sassoon, but his patients as a whole, loved him and his colleague [[Frederic Bartlett]] wrote of him {{quote|Rivers was intolerant and sympathetic. He was once compared to [[Moses]] laying down the law. The comparison was an apt one, and one side of the truth. The other side of him was his sympathy. It was a sort of power of getting into another man's life and treating it as if it were his own. And yet all the time he made you feel that your life was your own to guide, and above everything that you could if you cared make something important out of it.
<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bartlett, F. C. | year = 1922 | title = Obituary notice of WHR Rivers | journal = [[The Eagle (magazine)|The Eagle]] | pages = 2–14 }}</ref>}}

Sassoon described Rivers's [[Doctor-patient relationship#Bedside manner|bedside manner]] in his letter to Graves, written as he lay in hospital after being shot (a head wound that he had hoped would kill him – he was bitterly disappointed when it did not):

{{quote|But yesterday my reasoning Rivers ran solemnly in,<br>With peace in the pools of his spectacled eyes and a wisely omnipotent grin;<br>And I fished in that steady grey stream and decided that I<br>after all am no longer the Worm that refuses to die.<ref>Letter to Robert Graves, 1917, The War Poems of Siegfried Sassoon, Faber and Faber.</ref>}}
Rivers was well known for his compassionate, effective and pioneering treatments; as Sassoon's testimony reveals, he treated his patients very much as individuals.

=== Instinct and the Unconscious: A Contribution to a Biological Theory of the Psycho-Neuroses ===
Following his appointment at Craiglockhart War Hospital, Rivers published the results of his experimental treatment of patients at Craiglockhart in ''[[The Lancet]]'', "On the Repression of War Experience",<ref name=":2">{{cite journal|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/comment/rivers.htm|journal=The Lancet|title=The Repression of War Experience|author=W.

In the same year he published his findings in ''The Lancet'', Rivers also composed an article on the various types of "[[Psychotherapy|psycho-therapeutics]]" in practice at the time.<ref name="slobodin" /><ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics: Picts-Sacraments|last = Rivers|first = W.H.R.|publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons|year = 1919|location = New York|pages = 433–440|editor-last = Hastings|editor-first = James|volume = X|chapter = Psycho-therapuetics}}</ref> Rivers' personal and complete theory on the origin of the "psycho-neuroses," including the war neuroses, was not to be published until 1920 with the publication of ''Instinct and the Unconscious: A Contribution to a Biological Theory of the Psycho-Neuroses''.<ref name="instinct" />

River's theory of the neuroses incorporates everything Rivers had researched up until this point and was designed to "consider the general biological function of the process by which experience passes into the region of the unconscious...."<ref name="instinct" /> (pp.&nbsp;5–6). In other words, Rivers' goal was to outline an umbrella theory which would both explain neuroses and neurological issues as he had encountered them (see the subsection "A Human Experiment in Nerve Division" above) .

In attempting to construct such an umbrella theory, Rivers accepted that the unconscious exists and that the contents of the unconscious are entirely inaccessible to a person except through the processes of hypnosis, dreaming, or psychoanalysis. Rivers further defined the unconscious as a repository of instincts and associated experiences (i.e. memories) which are painful or not useful to the organism.<ref name="instinct" />

"Instincts," in this regard, are actions which an organism performs without learning and which are executed without the mediating influence of thought. As such, the action has an "all-or-none" aspect to it: it either does not occur at all or it occurs with all of its force. To this end, Rivers included the protopathic sensations,<ref name="NerveDivision" /> mass-reflex actions (as observed in spinal-cord injury patients), and basic emotions (i.e. anger, fear) as instincts.<ref name="instinct" />

Rivers further asserted that all painful or un-useful instincts are naturally kept out of conscious awareness (i.e. in the unconscious) by suppression. Suppression—in this view—is a natural and "unwitting" (unintentional) method for removing painful instincts from consciousness and confining them in the unconscious. Neuroses, therefore, develop when something in the natural process of suppression is disrupted so that a suppressed instinct and its associated emotion are released from the unconscious. Rivers cites two possible reasons for the "escape" of such instincts from the unconscious: either the instinct became too strong to contain, or the normal reserves which typically suppress it were weakened. It is important to note, however, that the etiology of war neuroses is not simply the escape of instincts from the unconscious and the ensuing conflict. More often than not, Rivers believed that the way in which such conflict is resolved (or is attempted to be resolved) also greatly influences the manifestation of the neuroses.<ref name="instinct" />

In regards to the war neuroses, Rivers believed that the disease's manifestation stems from the escape of the "self-preservation" or "danger instincts" from the unconscious. These "danger instincts," as Rivers conceives of them, include at least five types of reflexive reactions to danger: (i) fear as manifested by flight, (ii) aggression as manifested by fighting, (iii) the suppression of all emotion in order to complete complex tasks which leads to safety, (iv) terror as manifested by immobility, and (v) the suppression of all physical resources as manifested by collapsing. Typically, reactions i, ii, iv, and v are suppressed so that humans can remain calm in the face of fear and can complete complex actions which lead to safety. When all five "self-preservation" instincts are repeatedly aroused for long periods of time, such as during exposure to war, the instincts gain power and eventually "escape" from the unconscious. As such, the emotions of fear, aggression, and terror arise into consciousness, as do their associated responses. These emotions and their suggested actions create great conflict in the consciousness, however: "fear" and "terror" are far from socially acceptable in war. In order to deal with the conflict created by the "escaped" instincts, Rivers posited that the mind must do something to provide immediate relief.  It is this attempt to achieve relief from mental conflicts that leads to war neuroses.<ref name="instinct" />

For example, Rivers proposed that officers and soldiers who suffer from night terrors do so because they are trying to wittingly repress emotions and their associated instincts back into the unconscious.<ref name=":2" /> Repression, according to Rivers, is never adequate for removing conflict; it is only fruitful when a person can exert a conscious effort to do so. As a result, the repressed instincts, along with their associated emotions and memories, seep into consciousness when soldiers are sleeping.<ref name="instinct" /><ref name=":2" /> The result is night terrors.

In an alternative scenario, wartime hysteria can be explained as the body's suppression of normal physiological functioning in order to avoid the scenario which activates the danger instincts and releases the associated emotion of fear into consciousness. Hysterical soldiers often presented with symptoms of paralysis and diminished or lost sensory capacities, even in the absence of anxiety or depression.These physiological symptoms, although distressing in themselves, make it impossible for a soldier to be returned to the front line. Thus, the body compensates for its inability to suppress the danger instincts in the face of war by making it so that the soldier must avoid warfare altogether.<ref name="instinct" />

Overall, Rivers attributed the neuroses to both (i) the escape of painful instincts and their associated emotions from the unconscious and (ii) the mind's unsuccessful efforts to force such instincts and their emotions back into the conscious.<ref name="instinct" /> While Rivers' theory contains some [[Freudian]] elements,<ref name="slobodin" /> it is not simply a restatement of psychoanalytic theory; Rivers' theory of the neuroses draws heavily on the neurological observations and conclusions Rivers and [[Henry Head]] drew from their work on nerve regeneration.<ref name="NerveDivision" />

In retrospect, Rivers' particular method of treating the war neuroses and his theory of the origin of neuroses—while pioneering in their day—have failed to leave a huge mark on the history of psychology.<ref name=":4" /> However, the ''general'' contributions of [[Shell shock|psychiatrists treating war neuroses]], in combination with the overwhelming prevalence of the neuroses during the [[World War I|Great War]], led to a revolution in the British perspective of [[Mental Illness|mental illness]] and its treatment.

==Post war==

After the war, Rivers became "another and far happier man – diffidence gave place to confidence, reticence to outspokenness, a somewhat laboured literary style to one remarkable for ease and charm".<ref>Myers 1922</ref> He is quoted as saying "I have finished my serious work and I shall just let myself go." In those post war years, his personality seemed to change dramatically. The man who had been most at home in his study, the laboratory, or the field now dined out a good deal, had joined clubs, went yachting and appeared to welcome rather than shun opportunities for public speaking.<ref name="slobodin"/><ref name="odnb"/> Always having been a voracious reader, he now began reading in philosophy, as he had not done for some years, and also in imaginative literature. Not all of his friends from former years welcomed these changes; some felt that, along with his shyness, his scientific caution and good sense may have deserted him to a degree but most people who saw how happy Rivers had become agreed that the slight alterations to his character were for the better.<ref name="slobodin"/>

Rivers had visited his college frequently during the war although, having resigned his position as lecturer, he held no official post. However, upon his return from the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1919, the college created a new office for him – "Praelector of Natural Science Studies"<ref name="slobodin"/> – and he was given a free rein to do as he pleased. As [[Leonard E. Shore]] recalled in 1923: "when I asked him if he would undertake that work... his eyes shone with a new light I had not seen before, and he paced his rooms for several minutes full of delight."<ref name="slobodin"/> He took his new position to be a mandate to get to know every science student and indeed every other student at [[St. Johns, Cambridge]], and at other colleges. He would arrange "At Homes" in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall.<ref name="slobodin"/> He formed a group called ''[[The Socratics]]'' and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including [[H. G. Wells]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and Sassoon.<ref name="slobodin"/> Sassoon (Patient B in ''Conflict and Dream''), remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor.  They shared [[Socialist]] sympathies.

Rivers died of a [[strangulated hernia]] in the summer of 1922, shortly after being named as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate for the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]].<ref name="slobodin"/> He had agreed to run for parliament, as he said:

He had been taken ill suddenly in his rooms at St John's on the evening of Friday 3 June, having sent his servant home to enjoy the summer festivities.

==Others' opinions of Rivers==

===Poetry===
In the poem ''The Red Ribbon Dream'', written by [[Robert Graves]] not long after Rivers's death, he touches on the peace and security he felt in Rivers's rooms:

:For that was the place where I longed to be
:And past all hope where the kind lamp shone.

An anonymously written poem ''Anthropological Thoughts'' can be found in the Rivers collection of the Haddon archives at Cambridge.<ref>[http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/troufs/anth4616/video/Wm_Rivers.html "Everything is Relatives: William Rivers"]</ref>  There is a reference that indicates that these lines were written by [[Charles Elliot Fox]],<ref name="slobodin"/> missionary and ethnographer friend of Rivers.

===Quotations===
In Sassoon's autobiography (under the guise of ''[[Sherston trilogy|The Memoirs of George Sherston]]'') Rivers is one of the few characters to retain their original names. There is a whole chapter devoted to Rivers and he is immortalised by Sassoon as a near demi-god who saved his life and his soul. Sassoon wrote:

{{quote|I would very much like to meet Rivers in the next life. It is difficult to believe that such a man as he could be extinguished.|||preface to "Medicine, Magic and Religion"}}

Rivers was much loved and admired, not just by Sassoon. Bartlett wrote of his experiences of Rivers in one of his obituaries, as well as in many other articles, as the man had a profound influence on his life:

{{quote|On June 3 last year I was walking through the grounds of St. John's College, here in Cambridge, when I met Dr. Rivers returning from a stroll. He was full of energy and enthusiasm, and began at once to talk about certain new courses of lectures which he proposed to deliver at the Psychological Laboratory during the present year. On the evening of the next day I heard that he was dangerously ill. As I approached the College on the morning of June 5 I saw the flag at half mast. He had, in fact, died in the early afternoon of the preceding day. Never have I known so deep a gloom settle upon the College as fell upon it at that time. There was hardly a man-young or old-who did not seem to be intimately and personally affected. Rivers knew nearly everybody. As [[Praelector]] of Natural Sciences at St. John's he interviewed all the science freshmen when they came first into residence and, in an amazing number of cases, he kept in close touch with them throughout their Cambridge career. Everybody who came into contact with him was stimulated and helped to a degree which those who are acquainted only with his published works can never fully realise... it is of Rivers as a man that we think; of his eager and unconquerable optimism, and of his belief in the possible greatness of all things human. Whatever may be the verdict of the years upon his published works, the influence of his vivid personality will remain for all who knew him as one of the best things that have ever entered their lives.||| }}

Rivers's legacy continues even today in the form of [[The Rivers Centre]], which treats patients suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] using the same famously humane methods as Rivers had.<ref>[http://www.riverscentre.org.uk/ The Rivers Centre]</ref> There is also a Rivers Memorial Medal, founded in 1923, which is rewarded each year to an anthropologist who has made a significant impact in his or her field. Appropriately, Haddon was the first to receive this award in 1924.<ref>[http://www.therai.org.uk/honours/prior_huxley.html Prior Recipients] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712145950/http://www.therai.org.uk/honours/prior_huxley.html |date=12 July 2007 }}</ref>

==In fiction==

{{quote|He was a very humane, a very compassionate person who was tormented really by the suffering he saw, and very sceptical about the war, but at the same time he didn't feel he could go the whole way and say no, stop.|||Pat Barker}}

Sassoon writes about Rivers in the third part of ''[[Sherston trilogy|The Memoirs of George Sherston]]'', ''[[Sherston trilogy|Sherston's Progress]]''. There is a chapter named after the doctor and Rivers appears in the book as the only character to retain his factual name, giving him a position as a sort of demi-god in Sassoon's semi-fictitious memoirs.

The life of W. H. R. Rivers and his encounter with Sassoon was fictionalised by [[Pat Barker]] in the ''Regeneration Trilogy'', a series of three books including ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'' (1991), ''[[The Eye in the Door]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Ghost Road]]'' (1995). The trilogy was greeted with considerable acclaim, with ''The Ghost Road'' being awarded the [[Booker Prize]] in the year of its publication. ''Regeneration'' was filmed in 1997 with [[Jonathan Pryce]] in the role of Rivers.

The first book, ''Regeneration'' deals primarily with Rivers's treatment of Sassoon at Craiglockhart. In the novel we are introduced to Rivers as a doctor for whom healing patients comes at price. The dilemmas faced by Rivers are brought to the fore and the strain leads him to become ill; on sick leave he visits his brother and the Heads and we learn more about his relationships outside of hospital life. We are also introduced in the course of the novel to the Canadian doctor Lewis Yealland, another factual figure who used [[electric shock]] treatment to "cure" his patients. The juxtaposition of the two very different doctors highlights the unique, or at least unconventional, nature of Rivers's methods and the humane way in which he treated his patients (even though Yealland's words, and his own guilt and modesty lead him to think otherwise).

''The Eye in the Door'' concentrates, for the most part, on Rivers' treatment of the fictional character of Prior. Although Prior's character may not have existed, the facts that he makes Rivers face up to did – that something happened to him on the first floor of his house that caused him to block all visual memory and begin to stammer. We also learn of Rivers' treatment of officers in the airforce and of his work with Head. Sassoon too plays a role in the book- Rivers visits him in hospital where he finds him to be a different, if not broken, man, his attempt at 'suicide' having failed. This second novel in the trilogy, both implicitly and directly, addresses the issue of Rivers' possible homosexuality and attraction to Sassoon. From Rivers' reaction to finding out that Sassoon is in hospital to the song playing in the background ('You Made Me Love You') and Ruth Head's question to her husband, "Do you think he's in love with him?" we get a strong impression of the author's opinions on Rivers' sexuality.

''The Ghost Road'', the final part of the trilogy, shows a side of Rivers not previously seen in the novels. As well as his relationship with his sisters and father, we also learn of his feelings for Charles Dodgson- or Lewis Carroll. Carroll was the first adult Rivers met who stammered as badly as he did and yet he cruelly rejected him, preferring to lavish attention on his pretty young sisters. In this novel the reader also learns of Rivers' visit to Melanesia; feverish with [[Spanish flu|Spanish Flu]], the doctor is able to recount the expedition and we are provided with insight both into the culture of the island and into Rivers' very different "field trip persona".

Rivers appears briefly in [[The God of the Hive]], the tenth novel in the Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes series by mystery writer [[Laurie R. King]], in which he is the author of a medical letter, written during the war, concerning one of that novel's characters.
