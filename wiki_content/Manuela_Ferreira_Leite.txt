'''Maria Manuela Dias Ferreira Leite''' <small>[[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]] [[Order of Prince Henry|GCIH]]</small> (born [[Lisbon]], 3 December 1940), commonly known as '''Manuela Ferreira Leite''' ({{IPA-pt|mɐnuˈɛlɐ fɨˈʁɐjɾɐ ˈlɐjtɨ}}), is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[economist]], [[pundit]] and retired [[politician]].

==Background==
She was born in Lisbon, Portugal.
Manuela Ferreira Leite comes from a family of many generations of famous lawyers, but she has chosen to follow finance and economics instead. Her brother [[José Eugénio Dias Ferreira]] is a Lisbon lawyer and a [[political commentator]] and [[sports commentator]]. She is a daughter of Carlos Eugénio Dias Ferreira (b. [[Lisbon]], 18 May 1908), a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in [[Law]] from the [[Faculty of Law]] of the [[University of Lisbon]] and a [[lawyer]], and wife Julieta Teixeira de Carvalho, a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in [[Engineering]] from the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]] of the [[Technical University of Lisbon]] and an [[engineer]], daughter of José Teixeira de Carvalho and wife Etelvina Ferreira de Carvalho. Her paternal grandfather José Eugénio Dias Ferreira ([[Lisbon]], 13 November 1882 – [[Lisbon]], 17 January 1953) was also a lawyer from the [[University of Coimbra]], being a natural son of [[Minister (government)|Minister]] and [[Minister-counselor|Counselor]] [[José Dias Ferreira]] by an unknown mother.

She is a fifth cousin of her non-immediate predecessor [[Pedro Santana Lopes]].

==Career==
She is a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in [[Finances]] from the ISEG - ''Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão'' (formerly known as ''ISCEF - Instituto Superior de Ciências Económicas e Financeiras''), a noted economics and finance school of the [[Technical University of Lisbon]].

Manuela Ferreira Leite has in the past held several positions within the Portuguese government, including [[Minister of Education]] during [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]]'s cabinet between 1993 and 1995, and 112th [[Finance Minister|Minister of State and Finances]] during [[Durão Barroso]] cabinets between 6 April 2002 and 2004. In both cases her politics of contention was targeted for its alleged excessiveness. In Education, as so many of her predecessors and successors but with worse opposition and manifestations, she had to deal with the issue of [[tuition]]s, which even though of low value remains hard to afford by many [[college student]]s.
In 2006, she was non-executive administrator of the Portuguese [[Banco Santander Totta]].

She was also, between 2006 and 2008, member of the [[Council of State (Portugal)|Council of State]], designated by the [[President of Portugal]].

She was elected leader of the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]] on 31 May 2008, leading the party during the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|2009 legislative elections]]. She was unable to defeat the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] led by [[José Sócrates]], although achieving a slight increase in number of votes and seats. As leader of the major party outside the government, she was the Leader of the Opposition. She was succeeded as party leader by [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] on 9 April 2010.

After leaving PSD leadership she retired from active party politics (although she is still a member of the party). She currently has a weekly programme where she comments about politics and current affairs at the cable news channel [[TVI 24]].

==Personal life==
She was married to Rui Leite, a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in [[Economics]] from the Instituto Superior de Ciências Económicas e Financeiras of the [[Technical University of Lisbon]] and an [[Economist]], from whom she is now divorced and has three children:
* Nuno Dias Ferreira Leite, married at the Church of Campo Grande in Campo Grande, [[Lisbon]]), on 6 July 2006 to Mónica da Cruz Rocha Campos
* João Dias Ferreira Leite
* Ana Dias Ferreira Leite, married at the Church of Santos in Santos-o-Velho, [[Lisbon]], on 3 December 2005 to João Maria de Gouveia Durão de Quintanilha e Mendonça, born in [[Lisbon]], [[Alvalade (Lisbon)|Alvalade]], on 3 November 1978, only son of three children of João Maria de Azevedo de Quintanilha e Mendonça (b. 17 May 1952) and wife Maria Joana Guizado de Gouveia Durão, and had issue:
** ''Maria Ferreira Leite de Quintanilha e Mendonça (b. [[London]], [[Middlesex]], 24 April 2006)''
** ''João Maria Ferreira Leite de Quintanilha e Mendonça (b. [[London]], [[Middlesex]], 30 May 2008)''
** ''Vasco Ferreira Leite de Quintanilha e Mendonca (b. [[London]], [[Middlesex]], 17 September 2012)''
