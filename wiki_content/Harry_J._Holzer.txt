==Research==
Holzer's research has focused on the labor market problems of low-wage workers and other disadvantaged groups, particularly minority workers. He has studied the question of how employer characteristics, hiring practices and the job quality affect job opportunities for less-skilled workers, especially when they create "mismatches" between worker skills and those sought by employers, and between their respective geographic locations (or "spatial mismatch").

Holzer studied employer data extensively and implemented surveys of about 7000 firms during the 1990s on their hiring practices, skill needs and workforce characteristics. He analyzed trends in job quality and their effects on upward mobility for low-wage workers using LEHD{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2019}} data on workers and firms from the [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. He analyzed data on postsecondary education and employment outcomes, especially for disadvantaged workers.

Holzer's more recent work focuses on the challenges low-income youth and adults face in American higher education and in the job market. He has written extensively about the employment problems of disadvantaged men (especially those with criminal records), advancement prospects for the working poor, and workforce development policy.<ref>{{cite news |title=Plight Deepens for Black Men, Studies Warn |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 20, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/20/national/20blackmen.html }}</ref> He also has written about welfare reform, discrimination, [[affirmative action]], job training programs, and the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]].

Holzer's research on employment issues and policy has been funded by grants from the [[Joyce Foundation]], the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], the [[Institute for Research on Poverty]], the [[Upjohn Institute]], the U.S. Department of Labor, the [[National Science Foundation]], [[Ford Foundation]], [[Mott Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], the [[Smith Richardson Foundation]], the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]], and the [[Public Policy Institute of California]].
