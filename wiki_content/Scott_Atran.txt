==Early life and education==
Atran was born in New York City in 1952. While a student, he became assistant to anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He received his BA from [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]], MA from [[Johns Hopkins University]], and PhD in [[anthropology]] from [[Columbia University]].

==Career==
Atran has taught at Cambridge University, [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], the [[École pratique des hautes études]] and [[École Polytechnique|École polytechnique]] in Paris, and [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] in New York City. He is emeritus research director in anthropology at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] and member of the [[Jean Nicod Institute]] at the [[École normale supérieure (Paris)|École normale supérieure]]. He is also research professor of [[public policy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Michigan]], founding fellow of the Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict at [[Oxford University]], and cofounder of ARTIS International.

===Early years===
In 1974 he originated a debate at the [[Royaumont Abbey]] in France on the nature of universals in human thought and society.<ref>{{cite book| editor-first= Lawrence| editor-last= Kritzman| title= The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought| place= New York| publisher= Columbia University Press| year= 2006| pages= [https://archive.org/details/columbiahistoryo2006unse/page/179 179–180]| isbn= 978-0-231-10791-4| url= https://archive.org/details/columbiahistoryo2006unse/page/179}}</ref> Other participants included linguist [[Noam Chomsky]], psychologist [[Jean Piaget]], anthropologists [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]],<ref>{{cite web| last= Kwong |first= Emily |url=  http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs20091117-01.2.6 |title=Columbia antro dept. remembers Claude Lévi-Strauss |publisher=Columbia Spectator |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> and biologists [[François Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]].

He has collaborated on research on how political negotiations could be made more likely to produce agreement. Atran and the psychologists Jeremy Ginges and [[Douglas Medin]] and political scientist Khalil Shikaki conducted an experiment that surveyed "600 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, more than 500 Palestinian refugees, and more than 700 Palestinian students, half of whom identified with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad."<ref name="sacred bounds">{{cite journal |first1=Jeremy |last1=Ginges |first2=Scott |last2=Atran |first3=Douglas |last3=Medin |first4=Khalil |last4= Shikaki |title=Sacred bounds on rational resolution of violent political conflict |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |year=2007 |volume=104 |issue=18 |pages=7357–60 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701768104 |pmid=17460042 |pmc=1863499 |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.7357G |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Pinker Angels">{{cite book| first= Steven| last= Pinker| title= The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined| publisher= Viking Press| year= 2011| isbn= 978-0-670-02295-3| url= https://archive.org/details/betterangelsofou00pink}}</ref>{{rp|638}} The researchers divided the subjects into three groups, each presented with a different "hypothetical peace deal." In the basic situation, those surveyed were presented with "a two-state solution in which the Israelis would withdraw from 99 percent of the West Bank and Gaza but would not have to absorb Palestinian refugees"; the proposal "did not go over well."<ref name="Pinker Angels" />{{rp|638}} For the second group, the hypothetical deal "was sweetened with cash compensation from the United States and the European Union, such as a billion dollars a year for a hundred years, or a guarantee that the people would live in peace and prosperity. With these sweeteners on the table, the nonabsolutists, as expected, softened their opposition a bit. But the absolutists, forced to contemplate a taboo tradeoff, were even more disgusted, angry, and prepared to resort to violence."<ref name="Pinker Angels" />{{rp|638–39}} But for the third group, the proposed two-state solution was "augmented with a purely symbolic declaration by the enemy in which it compromised on one of its sacred values."

In the deal presented to Israeli settlers, the Palestinians "would give up any claims to their right of return" or "would be required to recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel";<ref name="Pinker Angels" />{{rp|639}} in that presented to the Palestinians, Israel "would recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Palestinians to their own state and would apologize for all wrongs done to the Palestinian people," or would "give up what they believe is their sacred right to the West Bank" or would "symbolically recognize the historic legitimacy of the right of return [without in fact granting it]".<ref name="sacred bounds" /> In summarizing the result, cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] claims, "Unlike the bribes of money or peace, the symbolic concession of a sacred value by the enemy, especially when it acknowledges a sacred value on one's own side, reduced the absolutists' anger, disgust, and willingness to endorse violence."<ref name="Pinker Angels" />{{rp|639}}

In a study of Middle East leaders published in [[Science (journal)]], Atran interviewed leaders, as distinct from popular views. In the earlier responses, people rejected material concessions without symbolic concessions, but were open to negotiations that started with symbolic concessions. Leaders responded the same way, except that they saw the symbolic concession as only an introduction to significant material concessions as well.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atran |first=Scott |title=Sacred Barriers to Conflict Resolution |volume=317 |issue=5841 |pages=1039–1040 |journal= Science |date=August 24, 2007 |doi=10.1126/science.1144241 |pmid=17717171 |citeseerx=10.1.1.394.7878 |s2cid=131373222 }}</ref>

For example, when the researchers asked [[Musa Abu Marzouk]], deputy chairman of Hamas, about a trade-off for peace without granting a right of return, he said “No.” When he was offered a trade-off with a substantial material incentive, he said “No” even more emphatically; “we do not sell ourselves for any amount.” But when he was offered an apology, he said “Yes,” although an apology would only be a beginning. “Our houses and land were taken away from us and something has to be done about that.”

Similarly, when the researchers asked [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] (then opposition leader), “Would you seriously consider accepting a two-state solution following the 1967 borders if all major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, were to recognize the right of the Jewish people to an independent state in the region?” he said, “Yes, but the Palestinians would have to show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations and then allow some border adjustments so that Ben Gurion [Airport] would be out of range of shoulder-fired missiles.”

====Field research on terrorism====
His work on the ideology and social evolution of transnational terrorism, which has included fieldwork with [[mujahedin]] and supporters in Europe, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, and North Africa, has challenged common assumptions. Cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] summarizes some of Atran's findings thus: 
{{quote|Far from being ignorant, impoverished, nihilistic, or mentally ill, suicide terrorists tend to be educated, middle class, morally engaged, and free of obvious psychopathology. Atran concluded that many of the motives may be found in nepotistic altruism... [Atran shows that] [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian terrorist groups [hold] out a carrot rather than a stick to the terrorist's family in the form of generous monthly stipends, lump-sum payments, and massive prestige in the community.... Atran has [also] found that suicide terrorists can be recruited without these direct incentives. Probably the most effective call to martyrdom is the opportunity to join a happy band of brothers. Terrorist cells often begin as gangs of underemployed single young men who come together in cafes, dorms, soccer clubs, barbershops, or Internet chat rooms and suddenly find meaning in their lives by a commitment to the new platoon.... Commitment to the group is intensified by religion, not just the literal promise of paradise but the feeling of spiritual awe that comes from submerging oneself in a crusade, a calling, a vision quest, or a jihad. [Atran writes that religion] may also turn a commitment to a cause into a sacred value — a good that may not be traded off against something else, including life itself. The commitment can be further stoked by the thirst for revenge, which in the case of militant Islamism takes the form of vengeance for the harm and humiliation suffered by any Muslim anywhere on the planet at any time in history, or for symbolic affronts such as the presence of infidel soldiers on sacred Muslim soil.<ref name="Pinker Angels" />{{rp|356–57}} }}

Atran has summarized his work and conclusions: 
{{quote|When you look at young people like the ones who grew up to blow up trains in Madrid in 2004, carried out the slaughter on the London underground in 2005, hoped to blast airliners out of the sky en route to the United States in 2006 and 2009, and journeyed far to die killing infidels in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia; when you look at whom they idolize, how they organize, what bonds them and what drives them; then you see that what inspires the most lethal terrorists in the world today is not so much the Koran or religious teachings as a thrilling cause and call to action that promises glory and esteem in the eyes of friends, and through friends, eternal respect and remembrance in the wider world that they will never live to enjoy.... Jihad is an egalitarian, equal-opportunity employer: ...fraternal, fast-breaking, thrilling, glorious, and cool.| Scott Atran, Testimony before U.S. Senate<ref name="Pinker Angels" />{{rp|357–58}} }}

Regarding Atran's analysis of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] as a revolutionary movement of "world-historic proportions,"<ref>{{cite news| last=Atran |first=Scott |url=https://aeon.co/essays/why-isis-has-the-potential-to-be-a-world-altering-revolution |title=ISIS is a Revolution |work=AEON |date=December 15, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Atran |first=Scott |url=https://instagloss.com/read/tempsreel.nouvelobs.com-monde-20160129.obs3681-l-etat-islamique-est-une-revolution-par-scott-atran.html |title=L'Etat islamique est une révolution, par Scott Atran |work=L'OBS |language= French| date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref> a writer for ''The New York Times'' considers Atran: 
{{quote|...a top anthropologist in Paris [who has combined] his research among disaffected youth with insights from such disparate figures as Hitler, Burke, Darwin and Hobbes, as well as close observation of the Islamic State’s advance into a 'globe-spanning jihadi archipelago'. He argues that we dismiss ISIS at our peril, and that in fact, we do much to promote its growth. Some of his historical conclusions will be controversial, but this is French intellectualism at its most profound — and most useful. Here’s a telling anecdote: When [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the French filmmaker [[René Clair]] watched '[[Triumph of the Will]]' (1935), [[Leni Riefenstahl]]’s visual paean to National Socialism, 'Chaplin laughed but Clair was terror-stricken, fearing that, if it were shown more widely, all might be lost in the West'.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nordland |first=Ron |url= http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/what-were-reading-120/ |title=The Allure of ISIS |work=The New York Times  |date=January 12, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref>}}

[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] accompanied Atran to frontlines in the battle against ISIS in Iraq, where he and his research team were assessing "will to fight" among the combatants: 
{{quote|Atran  fleshes out what he calls the 'Devoted Actor Framework' [as opposed to standard 'rational actor' frameworks], which pulls sacred values [which are immune to material trade offs] and identity fusion [complete merging of individual identity with group identity] into a single theory and offers advice for beating ISIS: 'The science suggests that sacred values are best opposed with other sacred values that inspire devotion, or by sundering the fused social networks that embed those values.' Left unspoken: How do you offer an equally inspiring alternative? By what method can those social networks be sundered? Atran doesn’t pretend to know the answer, but he does think that current attempts at so-called "countermessaging" are destined to fail because those messages are 'disembodied from the social networks in which ideas are embedded and given life.' Scholarly squabbles aside, there is near-universal admiration, bordering on awe, for how Atran is able to collect data in the midst of a violent conflict."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bartlett |first=Tom |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Scientist-Who-Talks-to/236521 |title=The Road to ISIS: An unorthodox anthropologist goes face to face with ISIS.

A series of experimental studies directed by Atran and social psychologist Ángel Gómez<ref>{{cite journal |title=The devoted actor's will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |year=2017 |volume=1 |issue=9 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3 |pmid=31024146 |pages=673–679 | last1 = Gómez | first1 = Ángel | last2 = López-Rodríguez | first2 = Lucía | last3 = Sheikh | first3 = Hammad | last4 = Ginges | first4 = Jeremy | last5 = Wilson | first5 = Lydia | last6 = Waziri | first6 = Hoshang | last7 = Vázquez | first7 = Alexandra | last8 = Davis | first8 = Richard | last9 = Atran | first9 = Scott|s2cid=46825422 }}</ref> performed with captured ISIS fighters, fighters of the Kurdistan Workers Party ([[PKK]]), [[Peshmerga]], Iraq Army and Arab Sunni Militia in Iraq, as well as with thousands of ordinary European citizens, have further elaborated the Devoted Actor framework in an effort to “help to inform policy decisions for the common defense.” According to reporting from ''CNN'':
{{quote|The researchers discovered that three crucial factors motivate both ISIS fighters and those fighting them: a deep commitment to sacred values, the readiness to forsake family for those values, and the perceived spiritual strength of the group or community that the fighter represents. [But] 'in our material world, we have underestimated or underplayed the spiritual dimension of human action,' [Atran] said. 'Doing so runs the risk of leaving ourselves open to people who are motivated by deeper spiritual and sacred values and virtues, and I think that's the greatest danger we face.'<ref>{{cite news|last=Howard |first=Jacqueline |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/04/health/isis-fighters-human-behavior-study/index.html |title=What motivates ISIS fighters -- and those who fight against them |work=CNN  |date=September 4, 2017 |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}</ref> }}

Atran argues in an interview in ''The Washington Post'' that: "Never in history have so few people with so few means caused so much fear."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gebelhoff |first=Robert |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2017/02/03/rethinking-the-war-on-terror-with-the-help-of-science/ |title=Rethinking the war on terrorism, with the help of science |work=The Washington Post  |date=February 3, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref> He and his research colleagues at ARTIS International contend that: 
{{quote|Despite intense efforts by intelligence agencies and countless conferences, articles, and books, fundamental aspects of terrorism remain unclear: What identifies terrorists before they act; how do they radicalize; what motivates their violence; when do they act; what countermeasures are most effective? These efforts to find answers have fallen short in part because... policymakers tend to fit such information to prevailing paradigms in foreign policy, military doctrine, and criminal justice, each with serious drawbacks when applied to terrorism."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Challenges in researching terrorism from the field | first1= Scott| last1= Atran| first2= Robert| last2= Axelrod| first3= Richard| last3= Davis| first4= Baruch| last4= Fischhoff |journal=Science |volume=355 |issue=6323 |pages=352–354 |date=January 27, 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aaj2037 |pmid=28126773 | bibcode= 2017Sci...355..352A| s2cid= 206653764}}</ref> }}

Atran and colleagues propose an alternative approach, driven by theoretically-framed field research that ground-truths big data and informs policy-making while maintaining intellectual independence. In 2017, Atran co-authored a groundbreaking paper with Angel Gomez, Lucia Lopez-Rodriguez, Hammad Sheikh, Jeremy Ginges, Lydia Wilson, Hoshang Waziri, Alexandra Vazquez, and Richard Davis. Titled 'The Devoted Actor's Will to Fight and the Spiritual Dimension of Human Conflict',<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gómez|first1=Ángel|last2=López-Rodríguez|first2=Lucía|last3=Sheikh|first3=Hammad|last4=Ginges|first4=Jeremy|last5=Wilson|first5=Lydia|last6=Waziri|first6=Hoshang|last7=Vázquez|first7=Alexandra|last8=Davis|first8=Richard|last9=Atran|first9=Scott|date=September 2017|title=The devoted actor's will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=1|issue=9|pages=673–679|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3|pmid=31024146|s2cid=46825422|issn=2397-3374}}</ref> the piece focuses on the spiritual dimensions of conflict based upon field work in Iraq with combatants and lab studies, assessing non-utilitarian dimensions of conflict. Atran and his team have validated aspects of these behavioral findings in recent neuroimaging studies of radicalized individuals in Europe, including greater willingness to fight and die for sacred versus non-sacred values that involves inhibition of deliberative reasoning in favor of rapid, duty-bound responses.<ref>{{cite web|last=Atran| first=Scott |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-people-become-radicalized/?redirect=1 |title=How People Become Radicalized: Neuroimaging shows social marginalization and sacred values are key factors |work=Scientific American |date=January 28, 2019 |accessdate=June 3, 2019}}</ref>

Atran's debates with [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Dan Dennett]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and others during the 2006 [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival|Beyond Belief]] symposium on the limits of reason and the role of religion in modern society highlight the differences between these authors, who see religion as fundamentally false beliefs associated with primitive cosmology, as well as politically and socially repressive, and Atran who sees unfalsifiable but semantically absurd religious beliefs and binding ritual obligations as historically critical to the formation and social cohesion of large-scale societies and current motivators for both conflict and cooperation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/bb.html |title=The Reality Club: BEYOND BELIEF |work=Edge.org |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Gray |first=John |url=http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/gray_12_10.html |title= The Privilege of Absurdity |work=Literary Review |date=December 2010 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last=Bartlett |first=Tom |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Does-Religion-Really-Poison/133457/ |title=Dusting Off GOD: A new science of religion says God has gotten a bad rap |journal =The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/06/god_and_the_ivory_tower| title= God and the Ivory Tower |work=Foreign Policy |date=August 6, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref>
