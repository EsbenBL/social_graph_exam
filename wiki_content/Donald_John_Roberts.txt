== Work ==
Roberts' research focuses on the design, governance and management of organizations, especially in an international context. He also has published extensively on industrial competition and the influence of differences in information among parties on strategic behavior.

=== Games of incomplete information in economic modeling ===
With [[Paul Milgrom]] he was instrumental in introducing the use of games of incomplete information into economic modeling and also with bringing the methods of [[ordinal optimization|lattice programming]] into the study of [[monotone comparative statics]] in economic analysis.

Most recently, he has been involved in two path-breaking controlled experiments in large firms examining the effects of changing management practices. One study involves Indian cotton weaving firms. The other involves a large Chinese service company.

== Selected publications ==
Roberts is the author of more than 70 scholarly articles and co-author of the first textbook on the economics of organization and management.
