==''Yurugu''==
Ani's 1994 work, ''Yurugu: An Afrikan-Centered Critique of European Cultural Thought and Behavior'', examined the influence of European culture on the formation of modern institutional frameworks, through [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]], from an African perspective.<ref name="Bush2004" /><ref name="ConferenceAsumah2002">{{cite book|author1=New York African Studies Association.

}}
Examining the causes of global [[white supremacy]], Ani argued that European thought implicitly believes in its own superiority, stating: "European culture is unique in the assertion of political interest".<ref name="Bush2004">{{cite book|author=Melanie E. L. Bush|title=Breaking the Code of Good Intentions: everyday forms of whiteness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNoky-bvSr0C&pg=PA28|access-date=4 July 2011|date=July 28, 2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-2864-2|page=28}}</ref>

In ''Yurugu'', Ani proposed a tripartite conceptualization of culture, based on the concepts of 
#''Asili'', the central seed or "germinating matrix" of a culture,
#''Utamawazo'', "culturally structured thought" or worldview, "the way in which the thought of members of a culture must be patterned if the ''asili'' is to be fulfilled", and
#''Utamaroho'', a culture's "vital force" or "energy source", which "gives it its emotional tone and motivates the collective behavior of its members".<ref name="Hawthorne2002-17-19" /><ref name="Howe1999" /><ref name="Ani1994xxv">{{cite book|author=Ani|title=Yurugu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBxmAAAAMAAJ|access-date=September 17, 2011|year=1994|page=xxv|isbn=9780865432482}}</ref>

The terms Ani uses in this framework are based on [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. ''Asili'' is a common Swahili word meaning "origin" or "essence"; ''utamawazo'' and ''utamaroho'' are neologisms created by Ani, based on the Swahili words ''utamaduni'' ("civilisation"), ''wazo'' ("thought") and ''roho'' ("spirit life").<ref name="Howe1999" /><ref name="Mazrui2004">{{cite book|author=Alamin M. Mazrui|title=English in Africa: after the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAYAaa2IwCcC&pg=PA101|access-date=4 July 2011|year=2004|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-689-6|page=101}}</ref><ref name="Hawthorne2002">{{cite book|author=Susan Hawthorne|title=Wild politics: feminism, globalisation, bio/diversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Um-ImUBOIb4C&pg=PA388|access-date=4 July 2011|year=2002|publisher=Spinifex Press|isbn=978-1-876756-24-6|page=388}}</ref> The ''utamawazo'' and ''utamaroho'' are not viewed as separate from the ''asili'', but as its manifestations, which are "born out of the ''asili'' and, in turn, affirm it."<ref name="Ani1994xxv"/>

Ani characterised the ''asili'' of European culture as dominated by the concepts of separation and control, with separation establishing dichotomies like "man" and "nature", "the European" and "the other", "thought" and "emotion" – separations that in effect end up negating the existence of "the other", who or which becomes subservient to the needs of (European) man.<ref name="Hawthorne2002-17-19" /> Control is disguised in universalism as in reality "the use of abstract 'universal' formulations in the European experience has been to control people, to impress them, and to intimidate them."<ref name="Ani199472">{{cite book|author=Ani|title=Yurugu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBxmAAAAMAAJ|access-date=January 19, 2012|year=1994|page=72|isbn=9780865432482}}</ref>

According to Ani's model, the ''utamawazo'' of European culture "is structured by ideology and bio-cultural experience", and its ''utamaroho'' or vital force is domination, reflected in all European-based structures and the imposition of Western values and civilisation on peoples around the world, destroying cultures and languages in the name of progress.<ref name="Hawthorne2002-17-19" /><ref name="Higgs2000">{{cite book|author=Philip Higgs|title=African Voices in Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaoOhJIZ5ZoC|access-date=4 July 2011|year=2000|publisher=Juta and Company Ltd|isbn=978-0-7021-5199-6|page=172}}</ref>

The book also addresses the use of the term [[Maafa]], based on a Swahili word meaning "great disaster", to describe [[slavery]].  [[African-centered]] thinkers have subsequently popularized and expanded on Ani's conceptualization.<ref name="Dagbovie2010" /> Citing both the centuries-long history of slavery and more recent examples like the [[Tuskegee study]], Ani argued that Europeans and white ''Americans'' have an "enormous capacity for the perpetration of physical violence against other cultures" that had resulted in "antihuman, genocidal" treatment of blacks.<ref name="Dagbovie2010">{{cite book|author=Pero Gaglo Dagbovie|title=African American History Reconsidered|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMum6d1bX-cC&pg=PA191|access-date=July 4, 2011|date=15 March 2010|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07701-2|page=191}}</ref><ref name="Ani1994427434">{{cite book|author=Ani|title=Yurugu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBxmAAAAMAAJ|access-date=September 17, 2011|year=1994|pages=427, 434|isbn=978-0-86543-248-2}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
Philip Higgs, in ''African Voices in Education'', describes ''Yurugu'' as an "excellent delineation of the ethics of harmonious coexistence between human beings", but cites the book's "overlooking of structures of social inequality and conflict that one finds in all societies, including indigenous ones," as a weakness.<ref name="Higgs2000"/>{{rp|175}} [[Molefi Kete Asante]] describes ''Yurugu'' as an "elegant work".<ref>[[Molefi Kete Asante]], "[https://books.google.com/books?id=bsayWnizUD0C&pg=PA198 Afrocentricity, Race, and Reason]", in [[Manning Marable]], ed., ''Dispatches from the Ebony Tower: intellectuals confront the African American experience'' (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|978-0-231-11477-6}}, page=198. Accessed: July 4, 2011.</ref> Stephen Howe accuses Ani of having little interest in actual Africa (beyond romance) and challenges her critique of "Eurocentric" logic since she invests heavily in its usage in the book.<ref name="Howe1999">{{cite book|author=Stephen Howe|title=Afrocentrism: mythical pasts and imagined homes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFrm19cZhugC&pg=PA247|access-date=July 4, 2011|year=1999|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-228-7|pages=247–248}}</ref>
