'''Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar''' ({{IPA-all|bhɪməɑo ɹæmdʒi ɑmbɛdkɑə}}; 14 April 1891&nbsp;– 6 December 1956) was an Indian [[jurist]], [[economist]], and [[Social Reformer|social reformer]] who fought economic and social discrimination against  the [[Untouchability|untouchables]] (now ''[[dalits]]'') in India's [[Hinduism|Hindu]] society, and who later renounced Hinduism and inspired the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]]. Ambedkar served as chairman of the [[Constituent Assembly of India|drafting committee]] of the Constitution of India, and [[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Minister of Law and Justice]] in the [[First Nehru ministry|first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru]] from 1947 to 1951. He is also referred to by the honorific '''Babasaheb''' ({{respell|BAH|bə|}} {{respell|SAH|hayb}}). 

Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning [[doctorate]]s in economics from both [[Columbia University]] and the [[London School of Economics]], gaining a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html |title=Archives released by LSE reveal BR Ambedkar's time as a scholar |date=9 February 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050301/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html |archive-date=9 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to [[Buddhism]], initiating mass conversions of Dalits.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism |date=2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0691157863 |editor-last=Buswell |editor-first=Robert Jr |editor-link=Robert Buswell Jr. |location=Princeton, NJ |page=34 |editor-last2=Lopez |editor-first2=Donald S.

In 1990, the ''[[Bharat Ratna]]'', India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation ''[[Jai Bhim]]'' (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. 

==Early life==
Ambedkar was  born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of [[Mhow]] (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) in  the [[Central Provinces]] (now in [[Madhya Pradesh]]).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |title=Ambedkar and Untouchability: Fighting the Indian Caste System |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-231-13602-1 |location=New York |page=2}}</ref> He was the 14th and last child of [[Ambedkar family|Ramji Maloji Sakpal]], an army officer who held the rank of [[Subedar]], and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.<ref name="Columbia">{{Cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html |title=In the 1890s |last=Pritchett |first=Frances |format=PHP |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907040421/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html |archive-date=7 September 2006 |access-date=2 August 2006}}</ref> His [[Ambedkar family|family]] was of [[Marathi people|Marathi]] background from the town of [[Ambadawe]] ([[Mandangad|Mandangad taluka]]) in [[Ratnagiri district]] of modern-day [[Maharashtra]].

Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school [[peon]], and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as ''"No peon, No Water"''.<ref name="Waiting for Visa">{{Cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html |title=Waiting for a Visa |last=Ambedkar |first=B.

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to [[Satara district|Satara]] two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons&nbsp;– Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao&nbsp;– and two daughters&nbsp;– Manjula and Tulasa&nbsp;– of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was ''Sakpal'' but his father registered his name as ''Ambadawekar'' in school, meaning he comes from his native village '[[Ambadawe]]' in Ratnagiri district.<ref name="loksatta.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/ |title=आंबडवे नाव योग्यच – खासदार अमर साबळे |date=14 April 2016|access-date=20 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.loksatta.com/kgtocollege-news/international-standard-educational-complex-at-original-village-of-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-446635/lite/ |title=डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर यांचे मूळ गाव आंबवडे येथे आंतरराष्ट्रीय दर्जाचे शैक्षणिक संकुल |date=18 April 2014|access-date=20 August 2021}}</ref><ref name="m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com">{{Cite web | url=https://m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MUM-ambedkars-teacher-family-saving-memories-of-ambedkar-5489831-NOR.html | title=आंबेडकर गुरुजींचं कुटुंब जपतंय सामाजिक वसा, कुटुंबानं सांभाळल्या 'त्या' आठवणी}}</ref><ref name="Ambavadekar">{{Cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263871 |title=Bhim, Eklavya |publisher=outlookindia.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811223316/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263871 |archive-date=11 August 2010 |access-date=17 July 2010}}</ref> His [[Devrukhe]] [[Brahmin]] teacher, Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from 'Ambadawekar' to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in school records.<ref>{{cite web

==Education==
===Post-secondary education===
In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at [[Elphinstone High School]]. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The match per the customs prevailing at that time was [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged]]  by the couple's parents.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Keer |first1=Dhananjay |title=Dr. Ambedkar: life and mission. |date=1971 |publisher=Popular Prakashan. |location=Mumbai India |isbn=81-7154-237-9 |page=20 |edition=Third |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Dr_Ambedkar/B-2d6jzRmBQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ambedkar+ramabai&pg=PP17&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>

===Studies at the University of Bombay===
[[File:Young Ambedkar.gif|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a student]]
In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered [[Elphinstone College]], which was affiliated to the [[University of Bombay]], becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities".

By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government.

===Studies at Columbia University===
In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar moved to the United States. He had been awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] ([[Gaekwad]] of [[Princely State of Baroda|Baroda]]) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at [[Wallach Hall|Livingston Hall]] with Naval Bhathena, a [[Parsi]] who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, ''Ancient Indian Commerce''. Ambedkar was influenced by [[John Dewey]] and his work on democracy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html |title=Ambedkar teacher |date=31 March 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403032535/http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html |archive-date=3 April 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1916 he completed his second thesis, ''National Dividend of India – A Historic and Analytical Study'', for another M.A.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html |title=Bhimrao Ambedkar |website=columbia.edu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115211/http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html |archive-date=10 February 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 9 May, he presented the paper ''[[Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development]]'' before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]].

===Studies at the London School of Economics===

In October 1916, he enrolled for the [[Bar examination|Bar course]] at [[Gray's Inn]], and at the same time enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]] where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on a different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.<ref name="Columbia3" /> He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921.

==Opposition to untouchability==

As Ambedkar was educated by the [[Princely State of Baroda]], he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time.

Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the [[Southborough Committee]], which was preparing the [[Government of India Act 1919]].

Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. [[Dhananjay Keer]] notes that "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the doctor".

While practising law in the [[Bombay High Court]], he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution [[Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha]], intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "[[Dalit|outcastes]]", at the time referred to as depressed classes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |title=Dr. Ambedkar |publisher=National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008195805/http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |archive-date=8 October 2012 |access-date=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the defence of Dalit rights, he started many periodicals like ''Mook Nayak'', ''Bahishkrit Bharat'', and ''Equality Janta''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Benjamin |first=Joseph |date=June 2009 |title=B.

By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against [[untouchability]]. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples. He led ''[[Mahad Satyagraha|a satyagraha]]'' in [[Mahad]] to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank of the town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&smid=23&pmid=1&id=857 |title=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar |publisher=Maharashtra Navanirman Sena |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041016/https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&smid=23&pmid=1&id=857 |archive-date=10 May 2011 |access-date=26 December 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the [[Manusmriti]] (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text.

In 1930, Ambedkar launched the [[Kalaram Temple|Kalaram Temple movement]] after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers assembled at [[Kalaram Temple]] satygraha making one of the greatest processions of [[Nashik]].

He went on to suggest that the communities he worked with were twenty times more oppressed by Congress policies than were Indian Muslims; he clarified that he was criticizing Congress, and not all Hindus.<ref name="dr-ambedkar">{{cite book |title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission |last=Keer |first=Dhananjay |year=2005 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=[[Mumbai]] |isbn=81-7154-237-9 |pages=330 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-2d6jzRmBQC |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> Jinnah and Ambedkar jointly addressed the heavily attended Day of Deliverance event in [[Bhindi Bazaar]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]], where both expressed "fiery" criticisms of the Congress party, and according to one observer, suggested that Islam and Hinduism were irreconcilable.<ref name="dr-ambedkar"/><ref name="man-who-divided-india">{{cite book |title=The Man Who Divided India: An Insight Into Jinnah's Leadership and Its Aftermath |last=Zakaria |first=Rafiq |year=2001 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=[[Mumbai]] |isbn=81-7154-892-X |pages=79 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbM6622HXCcC |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref>

After the [[Lahore resolution]] (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled ''Thoughts on Pakistan'', which analysed the concept of "Pakistan" in all its aspects. Ambedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab and Bengal should be redrawn to separate the Muslim and non-Muslim majority parts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite "understand the nature of their own demand". Scholar Venkat Dhulipala states that ''Thoughts on Pakistan'' "rocked Indian politics for a decade". It determined the course of dialogue between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for the [[Partition of India]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Sialkoti |first=Zulfiqar Ali |title=An Analytical Study of the Punjab Boundary Line Issue during the Last Two Decades of the British Raj until the Declaration of 3 June 1947 |url=http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |work=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture |volume=XXXV |issue=2 |year=2014 |pages=73–76}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Dhulipala |first=Venkat |title=Creating a New Medina |date=2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z6TBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-05212-3 |ref={{sfnref|Dhulipala, Creating a New Medina|2015}} |pages=124,&nbsp;134,&nbsp;142–144,&nbsp;149}}</ref>

In his work ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]'', Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the [[Scheduled Castes Federation]], although it performed poorly in the 1946 elections for [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Later he was elected into the constituent assembly of [[Bengal]] where [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was in power.<ref name="Firstpost 2015" />

Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of [[Rajya Sabha]], probably an appointed member. He tried to enter [[Lok Sabha]] again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.

Ambedkar also criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the [[Partition of India]], he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.

<blockquote>
No words can adequately express the great and many evils of polygamy and concubinage, and especially as a source of misery to a Muslim woman. Take the caste system. Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. [...] [While slavery existed], much of its support was derived from Islam and Islamic countries. While the prescriptions by the Prophet regarding the just and humane treatment of slaves contained in the Koran are praiseworthy, there is nothing whatever in Islam that lends support to the abolition of this curse. But if slavery has gone, caste among Musalmans [Muslims] has remained.<ref name="Ambedkar">{{Cite book |last=Ambedkar |first=Bhimrao Ramji |title=Pakistan or the Partition of India |publisher=Thackers Publishers |year=1946 |location=Bombay |pages=215–219 |chapter=Chapter X: Social Stagnation |access-date=8 October 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html}}</ref></blockquote>

==Drafting India's Constitution==

Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new Congress-led government invited Ambedkar to serve as the nation's first [[Minister of Law and Justice|Law Minister]], which he accepted. On 29 August, he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and was appointed by the Assembly to write India's new Constitution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/facts.htm |title=Some Facts of Constituent Assembly |website=Parliament of India |publisher=National Informatics Centre |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104514/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/facts.htm |archive-date=11 May 2011 |access-date=14 April 2011 |quote=On 29 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly set up an Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of B.

[[Granville Austin]] described the [[Indian Constitution]] drafted by Ambedkar as 'first and foremost a social document'. 'The majority of India's constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement.'<ref>{{Citation |last=Austin |first=Granville |title=The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

The text prepared by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of [[civil liberties]] for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of [[reservation in India|reservations]] of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled caste]]s and [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Class]], a system akin to [[affirmative action]]. India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.<ref name="Sheth">{{Cite journal |last=Sheth |first=D.

Ambedkar opposed [[Article 370]] of the [[Constitution of India]], which granted a special status to the [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|State of Jammu and Kashmir]], and which was included against his wishes. [[Balraj Madhok]] reportedly said, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader, [[Sheikh Abdullah]]: "You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it." Then Sk. Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to [[N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar|Gopal Swami Ayyangar]], who in turn approached [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Patel]], saying Nehru had promised Sk. Abdullah the special status. Patel got the Article passed while Nehru was on a foreign tour. On the day the article came up for discussion, Ambedkar did not reply to questions on it but did participate on other articles. All arguments were done by Krishna Swami Ayyangar.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sehgal |first=Narender |title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes |publisher=Utpal Publications |year=1994 |location=Delhi |chapter=Chapter 26: Article 370 |access-date=17 September 2013 |chapter-url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905070936/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html |archive-date=5 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |title=Why Ambedkar refused to draft Article 370 |last=Tilak |publisher=Indymedia India |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207095529/http://www.india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |archive-date=7 February 2004 |access-date=17 September 2013}}</ref>{{quote box

His theory of State Socialism had three points: state ownership of agricultural land, the maintenance of resources for production by the state, and a just distribution of these resources to the population. He emphasised a free economy with a stable Rupee which India has adopted recently.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} He advocated birth control to develop the Indian economy, and this has been adopted by Indian government as national policy for family planning. He emphasised equal rights for women for economic development.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Ambedkar's views on agricultural land was that too much of it was idle, or that it was not being utilized properly. He believed there was an "ideal proportion" of production factors that would allow agricultural land to be used most productively. To this end, he saw the large portion of people who lived on agriculture at the time as a major problem. Therefore, he advocated industrialization of the economy to allow these agricultural labourers to be of more use elsewhere.<ref name="Ingle M R" />

Ambedkar was trained as an economist, and was a professional economist until 1921, when he became a political leader. He wrote three scholarly books on economics:

A number of unfinished typescripts and handwritten drafts were found among Ambedkar's notes and papers and gradually made available.

A memorial for Ambedkar was established in his [[Delhi]] house at 26 Alipur Road. His birthdate is celebrated as a public holiday known as [[Ambedkar Jayanti]] or [[Bhim Jayanti]].

===Religion===

Ambedkar said in 1935 that he was born a Hindu but would not die a Hindu. He viewed Hinduism as an "oppressive religion" and started to consider conversion to any other religion.<ref name="Rao1999">{{cite book|author=Anupama P.

Ambedkar viewed Christianity to be incapable of fighting injustices. He wrote that "It is an incontrovertible fact that Christianity was not enough to end the slavery of the Negroes in the United States. A civil war was necessary to give the Negro the freedom which was denied to him by the Christians."<ref>{{cite book|title=For the Solution of the "Caste" Question, Buddha is Not Enough, Ambedkar is Not Enough Either, Marx is a Must|author=[[Ranganayakamma]]|page=404}}</ref>

Ambedkar criticized distinctions within Islam and described the religion as "a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction".<ref name="RoyBecker2020">{{cite book|author1=Anupama Roy|author2=Michael Becker|title=Dimensions of Constitutional Democracy: India and Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrzoDwAAQBAJ|date=1 June 2020|publisher=Springer Nature|isbn=9789811538995|pages=120}}</ref>

He opposed conversions of depressed classes to convert to Islam or Christianity added that if they converted to Islam then "the danger of Muslim domination also becomes real" and if they converted to Christianity then it "will help to strengthen the hold of Britain on the country".<ref name="Keer1971">{{cite book|author=Dhananjay Keer|title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-2d6jzRmBQC&pg=PA280|year=1971|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-237-6|pages=280–}}</ref>

=== Aryan Invasion Theory ===
Ambedkar viewed the [[Shudras]] as Aryan and adamantly rejected the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryan invasion theory]], describing it as "so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago" in his 1946 book ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]''.<ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51">Bryant, Edwin (2001). ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 50–51. {{ISBN|9780195169478}}</ref> Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally being "part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society", but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on [[Brahmins]].<ref>Bryant, Edwin. ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 50.</ref>

According to Arvind Sharma, Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''anās''  in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].<ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005">Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 849.</ref> Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:

{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.<ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005" />}}

Ambedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|outside India]], and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself. According to Ambedkar, the Rig Veda says Aryans, Dāsa and Dasyus were competing religious groups, not different peoples.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Arvind|author-link=Arvind Sharma|date=2005|title=Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4139922|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=73|issue=3|pages=843–870|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfi081|issn=0002-7189|jstor=4139922}}</ref>

=== Communism ===
Ambedkar's views on Communism were expressed in his essay "Buddhism and Communism." He accepted the Marxist theory that the privileged few's exploitation of the masses perpetuated poverty and its issues. However, he did not see this exploitation as purely economic, theorizing that the cultural aspects of exploitation are as bad or worse than economic exploitation. In addition, he did not see economic relationships as the only important aspect of human life. He also saw Communists as willing to resort to any means to achieve proletarian revolution, including violence, while he himself saw democratic and peaceful measures as the best option for change. Ambedkar also opposed the Marxist idea of controlling all the means of production and private ownership of property: seeing the latter measure as not able to fix the problems of society. In addition, rather than advocating for the eventual annihilation of the state as Marxism does, Ambedkar believed in a classless society, but also believed the state would exist as long as society and that it should be active in development.<ref name=":0" />

==In popular culture==
Several films, plays, and other works have been based on the life and thoughts of Ambedkar. 
* Indian director [[Jabbar Patel]] made a documentary titled ''Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar'' in 1991; he followed this with a full-length feature film ''[[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (film)|Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]]'' in 2000 with [[Mammootty]] in the lead role.<ref>{{cite news
