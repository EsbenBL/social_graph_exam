'''Otis Dudley Duncan''' (December 2, 1921 in [[Nocona, Texas]] – November 16, 2004, in [[Santa Barbara, California]]) was "the most important quantitative [[sociologist]] in the world in the latter half of the 20th century", according to sociologist [[Leo Goodman]].<ref>{{citation|title=Otis Dudley Duncan, quantitative sociologist par excellence: Path analysis, loglinear methods, and Rasch models|first=Leo A.|last=Goodman|authorlink=Leo Goodman|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=25|issue=2|year=2007|pages=129–139|doi=10.1016/j.rssm.2007.05.005}}.</ref> His book ''The American Occupational Structure'', which received the [[American Sociological Association]]'s [[Sorokin Award]], documented how parents transmit their societal status to their children. Duncan compiled his thoughts on the major issues of the field into ''Notes on Social Measurement'', which he considered his greatest work.

== Biography and career ==
One of the most influential sociologists in history, Otis Dudley Duncan was instrumental in transforming mainstream American sociology into a quantitatively based [[empirical]] social science in the second half of the twentieth century.  His key scholarly contributions include the introduction of [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] to sociology; the measurement of occupational [[socioeconomic]] standing with an index (Duncan Socioeconomic Index); the study of intergenerational occupational mobility; the spatial analysis of residential patterns; the application and advancement of [[log-linear model]]s and [[Rasch model]]s for categorical social science data; and a landmark treatise on social measurement (Duncan 1984).

Duncan’s best known work is a 1967 book that he coauthored with [[Peter Blau]], ''The American Occupational Structure''.  Based on quantitative analyses of the first large national survey of [[social mobility]] in the United States, the book elegantly depicts the process by which parents transmit their social standing to their children, particularly through affecting the children’s education.  The book’s impact went far beyond its analyses of occupational mobility.  Using [[statistical survey|survey]] data and [[statistical]] techniques, it showed how an important sociological topic could be analyzed effectively and rigorously with appropriate [[Statistics|quantitative]] methods.  The work helped inspire a new generation of sociologists to pursue quantitative sociology. Today a worldwide community of sociologists specializing in [[social stratification]] and social mobility still work on elaborating the Blau-Duncan model to include such additional factors as [[cognitive ability]], race, and social context in studying the transmission of social standing from one generation to the next.

Duncan retired in 1987, taking up pursuits such as composing [[electronic music]] and [[computer graphics]]. In 2000 he joined his local [[humanism|Humanist Society]] which led him to publish new work on the prevalence of [[creationism]], tolerance of [[atheist]]s, support for [[euthanasia]] and other such issues.
