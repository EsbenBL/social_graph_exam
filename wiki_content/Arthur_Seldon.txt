==Biography==
Arthur Seldon was born Abraham Margolis in the [[East End of London]] to Masha and Pinhas Margolis.  They came to Britain from Kiev fleeing the anti-semitic pogroms in 1903 or 1904.  Abraham was probably born at Mrs Levy's Maternity Home, Petticoat Lane, near Aldgate, London.  Masha and Pinchas Margolis were married in Kiev; he was probably born at Perioslav, a village near Kiev.  The family were very poor: Pinchas worked making caps at a Jewish immigrant's factory called Goldstein & Co, Commercial Road, Stepney and, they lived at 12 Marks Street, Aldgate.  It was not until after they moved to 13 Beeford Street, Stepney that Abraham was actually born.  His oldest brother Jack was born in 1906, and a sister Bess in 1910; brothers Susman and Solly Margolis changed their names to Cecil Margolis and Sidney Margolis respectively; only Abraham changed his whole name.  His mother Masha had two brothers Ben and Morris Kopelolt who had also come to London as refugees.  When his parents both died in the [[Spanish flu]] [[pandemic]] of 1918, his uncle’s families took the boys in, and then sent them away to school.  Abraham was put up for adoption by a cobbler, Pinchas Slaberdain, and his wife Eva at 154 Oxford Street, Commercial Road, Stepney.  Arthur Seldon never forgot where he came from, and the intense poverty that had shaped his family's arrival in this country.  But rather than turning for help to socialism he worked hard, first at school, and then to get a tertiary education becoming self-reliant.

Aged only eight he remembered cheering on the Labour candidate for Stepney in the 1924 General election campaign.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Abraham was educated at elementary school [[Raine's Foundation School|Sir Henry Raine's Grammar School]].  There in 1928 he was impressed by History master E J Hayward's interpretation of cottage industry's transition to capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurseldon.org/content/newspaper/liberaljournal.asp|title=Arthur Seldon|website=www.arthurseldon.org}}</ref>  A scholarship paid for the [[London School of Economics]] where he read [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Arnold Plant]] and [[Lionel Robbins]] served to deepen his interest in [[classical liberalism]].  [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s ''[[Road to Serfdom]]'' introduced him to [[Austrian School|Austrian economics]].  Seldon helped found the small university's student Liberal Society.  He retained anti-fascist principles as war drew nearer.

He served with the army in North Africa and Italy during the war.  Arthur married Marjorie in 1948, and continued to be involved with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].  He was chairman of its committee on the elderly from 1948 to 1949.

Seldon was working at the Brewer's Society in 1956 when approached by [[Alfred Suenson-Taylor, 1st Baron Grantchester|Lord Grantchester]] to be asked if he wanted to join a new 'Think Tank' just set up by [[Antony Fisher]] on the advice of Friedrich Hayek, founder of the Chicago School of economics and champion of free market [[neoliberalism]].  Seldon wrote a first pamphlet still only 20 years of age, called "The Intellectuals and Socialism" (1937) in which he criticised the Keynesian state and its bureaucracy as "second hand dealers in ideas."<ref name=Robinson>Colin Robinson, ''Arthur Seldon: A Life of Liberty'', Profile Books, (London, 2009), {{ISBN|978-1846682490}} pp. 35, 60</ref> Ralph Harris was appointed General Director of the new [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] and Arthur was Editorial Adviser.  Antony, later Lord Fisher left a legacy of think tanks that he had founded all around the world.  "The State Versus Market" pamphlet was published when he was still only twenty years old, based on a book review, it explained the benefits of market competition.

Seldon joined the Liberal Party.  He was on a Committee of Enquiry chaired by [[Elliott Dodds]] into the distribution of property, exploring the idea of "ownership for all," and the effects of statist maldistribution.  In "The Drift to Corporate State" he severely criticised the corporatist industrial policy being against state monopoly.  It was an idea endorsed by the [[Liberal Assembly]] ten years earlier in 1948.  In another pamphlet in 1957, the IEA published "Pensions in a Free Society" commented freely on the Liberal [[Beveridge Report]] of 1942 into founding of the state pension system.  Seldon generated editorial copy: edited recruited authors, made available titles to a wider audience.  Pamphlets were of between 10,000 and 15,000 words and as such represented a new form of political literature.  It was also Seldon's inspiration to produce series, such as Hobart Papers, Occasional Papers, and Readings etc.

Seldon was also involved in the famous [[1962 Orpington by-election|Orpington by-election]] in 1962, in which the Liberal Party gained the seat from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and weakened the confidence of the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] administration.  A neoliberal [[Free markets|free marketeer]], he influenced the policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/15/obituaries/arthur-seldon-economist-is-dead-at-89.html|title=Arthur Seldon, Economist, Is Dead at 89|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=15 October 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

In 1970 Seldon invited Milton Friedman at the IEA, quick to recognise the value of monetarist policy.  The ideas imported from Chicago had a great influence on members of the Conservative party, especially [[Enoch Powell]], Sir [[Keith Joseph]], and Margaret Thatcher.  Public Choice Theory analysed the relations between the State and voluntary activity.  He organised a conference in 1978 called "Economics in Britain" – the American economist James Buchanan, founder of Public Choice was invited.  In 1980 Seldon founded the IEA's "Economic Journal".  Seldon gained a reputation as an exceptionally competent editor.  He would, according to Ralph Harris, re-write poor pamphlets to such an extent as to almost become its co-author.  In "Vote Motive" he found a voice that was most profound and influential, shaping the post-modern ethos for electioneering and party politics.<ref name=Robinson />

Seldon won the Fisher Arts Literary Prize in 1991, although it was established by the founder of IEA, so nobody minded the eternal paradox, for his book ''Capitalism''.  He received an honorary degree in 1999 from the [[University of Buckingham]].
