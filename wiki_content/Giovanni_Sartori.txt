==Biography==
Born in [[Florence]] in 1924, Sartori graduated in Political and Social Sciences at the [[University of Florence]] in 1946. He stayed on at he University of Florence, teaching History of Modern Philosophy and Doctrine of the State starting in 1946. He became a lecturer in Modern Philosophy (1950–56) and in Political Science (1956–63), and subsequently professor of Sociology (1963–66). Sartori became full professor of Political Science and taught at Florence University from 1966 to 1976.<ref>[https://www.senato.it/application/xmanager/projects/leg18/file/sartori_biobibliografia_def.pdf Giovanni Sartori, "Note biografiche e bibliografia," 2018, p. 21]</ref>

During this time, Sartori founded the first modern Political Science academic post in Italy, and was Dean of the newly formed University of Florence's Department of Political Science.<ref>[https://www.senato.it/application/xmanager/projects/leg18/file/sartori_biobibliografia_def.pdf Giovanni Sartori, "Note biografiche e bibliografia," 2018, p. 21]</ref>

Sartori also taught at the European University Institute (1974–76) and then became professor of Political Science at [[Stanford University]] (1976–79). Finally, Sartori served as Albert Schweitzer Professor in the Humanities at [[Columbia University]] from 1979 to 1994 and was appointed [[Professor Emeritus]].[http://www.giovannisartori.it/en/biography/]<ref>https://ecpr.eu/Prizes/PrizeWinners.aspx?PrizeID=5</ref><ref>[https://www.senato.it/application/xmanager/projects/leg18/file/sartori_biobibliografia_def.pdf Giovanni Sartori, "Note biografiche e bibliografia," 2018, p. 20]</ref>

==Research==
Sartori's interests were wide-ranging, but his lasting contributions were largely on political parties, constitutional design, and perhaps most significantly, concept analysis.

===On concepts===
Sartori was deeply interested in the formation, analysis, and use of political concepts.  He observed that political science, for better or worse, lacked the coordination in terminology that he presumed to exist in the physical and biological sciences.  He encouraged a more "intentional" use of concepts, with the objective of furthering a shared understanding of ideas.  In 1970, he and others established the first permanent research committee of the newly created [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA).  The committee, [https://www.concepts-methods.org Research Committee on Concepts and Methods] (RC 01), was intended to ameliorate the "Tower of Babel problem" in political science, and is still active.

Sartori's 1970 article "Concept Misformation in Comparative Politics" published in ''[[The American Political Science Review]]'' is prominent in the field,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Evan S.|date=2010|title=Bridging the Qualitative-Quantitative Divide: Best Practices in the Development of Historically Oriented Replication Databases|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.041007.155222|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=37–59|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.041007.155222|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref> leading Gary Goertz to write, "There are few articles in political science that deserve the predicate "classic," but Sartori's ... merits the label."<ref>Gary Goertz. ''Concept Formation''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006. p. 69</ref> Sartori's notions of "conceptual traveling" (the application of a concept from one case to a new case) and "conceptual stretching" (the mismatch that happens when a concept does not fit a new case) is influential in social science methodology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=David|last2=Mahon|first2=James E.|date=1993|title=Conceptual "Stretching" Revisited: Adapting Categories in Comparative Analysis|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=4|pages=845–855|doi=10.2307/2938818|jstor=2938818|s2cid=2155412|issn=0003-0554|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0ps3z02q}}</ref> Conceptual stretching is frequently used as a criticism of studies that employ large-N quantitative analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Evan S.|date=August 2005|title=Nested Analysis as a Mixed-Method Strategy for Comparative Research|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=99|issue=3|pages=435–452|doi=10.1017/s0003055405051762|s2cid=16326902|issn=0003-0554}}</ref>

===On parties and party systems===
Sartori's ''Parties and Party Systems: A Framework for Analysis'' (1976) is a book that is seen as having as "outstanding, lasting significance to the field" on study on political parties.<ref>Peter Mair, "Introduction," in Giovanni Sartori, ''Parties and Party Systems: A Framework for Analysis''. Colchester; ECPR Press, 2005, p. xviii.</ref> The book provides a comprehensive and authoritative approach to the classification of party systems.
