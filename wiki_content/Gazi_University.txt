'''Gazi University''' ({{lang-tr|Gazi Üniversitesi}}) is a public [[university]] primarily located in [[Ankara, Turkey]].
It was established in 1926 by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] as Gazi Teacher Training Institute. In 1982, it was reorganized by merging with the Bolu Academy of Engineering and Architecture, Ankara Academy of Economics and Commercial Sciences, the Ankara College of Technical Careers, the Ankara Girls' College of Technical Careers, and the Ankara State Academy of Engineering and Architecture to become a large metropolitan university as part of the act which created the Board of Higher Education. Prior to 1982 when the Board of Higher Education Law came into effect, institutes of higher education in Turkey were organized under different structures as universities, academies, institutes, and schools. In 1992 faculties  and vocational schools in Bolu became [[Abant Izzet Baysal University]].

Gazi University comprises 21 faculties, 4 schools, 11 vocational schools of higher education, 52 research centers and 7 graduate institutes. The student enrollment of Gazi University has reached approximately 77,000 in total of whom about 1,500 come from the [[Turkic states]] of [[Central Asia]]. Five thousand students are enrolled in graduate programmes. The total size of the teaching faculty exceeds 3,000 persons.

==Campuses==
Gazi University is a ''city-university'' which has a multitude of campuses around [[Ankara]], the capital city of Turkey. Its main campus is situated in Beşevler.

== Gazi University Central Library ==

The library subscribes to 700 periodicals in foreign languages and 600 in Turkish, and provides access to 20,000 on-line journals and 30 on-line databases. Collections are predominantly in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. Library orientation programs are organized for new Gazi students.

==Achievements==
[[Turkey]]'s third face transplant, a partial face transplant, was  performed on March 17, 2012 on Hatice Nergis, a twenty-year-old woman, at the university's hospital by a team led by surgeon [[Selahattin Özmen]]. The patient from [[Kahramanmaraş]] had lost her upper jaw six years prior, including mouth, lips, palate, teeth and nasal cavity by a firearm accident, and was unable to eat. She had undergone in the past around 35 reconstructative plastic surgery operations. The donor was a 28-year-old woman in [[Istanbul]], who committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2012/03/23/gazi-yuz-naklini-damardan-bagladi |newspaper=[[Sabah (Newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Gazi, yüz naklini 'damardan' bağladı |author=Cantürk, Safure |date=2012-03-23 |language=tr |access-date=2012-03-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1260147&title=ucuncu-yuz-nakli-gazi-universitesi-tip-fakultesi-hastanesinde-basladi |newspaper=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]] |title=Üçüncü yüz nakli Gazi Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi Hastanesi'nde başladı |date=2012-03-17 |language=tr |access-date=2012-03-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319141259/http://zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1260147&title=ucuncu-yuz-nakli-gazi-universitesi-tip-fakultesi-hastanesinde-basladi |archive-date=2012-03-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25331432/ |newspaper=NTV MSNBC |title=Üçüncü yüz nakli bir kadına  |date=2012-03-17 |language=tr|access-date=2012-03-26 }}</ref>
