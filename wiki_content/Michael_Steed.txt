He was born in 1940 in [[Kent]], where his father was a farmer. He has written extensively on political parties and elections.

==Education and early life==
He was educated at [[St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate]], and at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. In 1960, the South African authorities refused him entry to [[Sharpeville]] to deliver food aid to victims of the [[Sharpeville massacre|Sharpeville shootings]].<ref>"Not allowed in Sharpeville: Cambridge student barred", ''The Guardian'', London, 23 August 1960.</ref>

From 1963 to 1965, Steed undertook postgraduate research at [[Nuffield College]], Oxford, under [[David Butler (academic)|Dr. David Butler]]. At the same time he was active in the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]], particularly on the issue of [[apartheid in South Africa]].<ref>"Young Liberals protest to Home Secretary", ''The Guardian'', London, 30 March 1964.</ref> He became national Vice-Chairman of the Young Liberals.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.andrewwhitehead.net/the-land-song.html |title=The Land Song |website=Andrew Whitehead |date=May 2011 |access-date=20 April 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1966, Steed became Lecturer in Government at [[Manchester University]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Parry, Geraint|title=Participation in politics|others=Anderson, Bryce,, Arblaster, Anthony,, Austin, Dennis, 1922-, Bulpitt, Jim,, Dodd, C. H. (Clement Henry),, Evans, Michael|year=1972|isbn=0-87471-131-2|location=Manchester|oclc=587215}}</ref> a post he held for many years until taking early retirement through ill health. As a psephologist, he became a specialist in the detailed analysis of election results from a sociological point of view, for many years providing media such as ''The Observer'' and ''The Economist'' with texts making such complexities as "percentage swing" accessible to the lay reader.<ref>E.g. Peter Pulzer and Michael Steed, "What your votes foretell", ''The Observer'', London, 12 April 1964.</ref> In the late-1960s and throughout the 1970s, he made regular television appearances on "election night" programmes, often at the side of [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Bob McKenzie]] who popularised the "swingometer" based on the concept of [[Swing (politics)|swing]] devised by David Butler.<ref>E.g. "The Night of the Machines: Clive James on the BBC's great election spectacular", ''The Observer'', 13 October 1974.</ref> Steed was to develop a more complex formula for calculating swing, sometimes known among psephologists as "Steed swing" to differentiate it from "Butler swing".

From 1964 to 2005, Steed, latterly in conjunction with Professor [[John Curtice]], was responsible for the statistical analysis in David Butler's regular Nuffield election studies entitled "The British General Election of ....".<ref>Richard Rose, "The Nuffield election studies come of age", ''The Times'', London, 27 October 1966, p.13.</ref><ref>David McKie, "A man with a franchise to unlock the secret of the ballot", ''The Guardian'', London, 15 April 1988.</ref>

==Political activity and views==
Steed was a leading member of the "radical" wing of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] which in the late-1960s and 1970s found itself at odds with the parliamentary party and then-leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] over a number of issues. In particular, Steed and his colleagues felt that "the party must shift attention away from personalities to a wide-ranging debate about ideology, principles and policies".<ref>"Liberal calls to end 'slanging': Leader will face his critics", ''The Times'', London, 17 June 1968, p.2.</ref><ref>"Renewed challenge to Thorpe leadership", ''The Guardian'', London, 15 September 1969.</ref> He contributed several articles to the radical monthly, ''New Outlook''. For a time, he was an elected member of the Liberal Party's national executive.

Michael Steed has always been an ardent [[pro-European]], and his study of parties and elections soon came to embrace continental as well as UK politics.<ref>E.g. Michael Steed, "De Gaulle no longer a 'national' leader", ''The Guardian'', London, 23 December 1965.</ref> In 1969, he called for a common European currency.<ref>"Flexible pound urged", ''The Times'', London, 20 September 1969, p.15.</ref>

At the 1971 [[Liberal Assembly]], he successfully moved the major pro-European resolution, noting however that the then-EEC, in which decisions were taken by "a secret cabal", must be made more democratic. National sovereignty, he argued, would "die away as a European democracy of widely diffused power was created and exercised at all levels" in "a close political union of the people of Europe".<ref>"Common Market poll rejected", ''The Guardian'', London, 18 September 1971.</ref><ref>"Goal of unity in EEC", ''The Times'', 18 September 1971, p.23.</ref>

Steed consistently called for wide-ranging constitutional reform, including devolution all round, with elected regional governments, a more proportional election system, and the abolition of a [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s right to dissolve Parliament on a whim.<ref>See e.g. Michael Steed, "Changing the rules of the general election game", ''The Times'', 19 June 1975, p.14.</ref> This last objective was finally achieved by the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/contents/enacted Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

He stood as the Liberal Party candidate at the 1967 [[Brierley Hill]] by-election<ref>"Liberal choice is lecturer", ''The Guardian'', London, 8 April 1967.</ref> and the 1973 [[Manchester Exchange (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Exchange]] by-election, in which he pushed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] into third place.<ref>John Chartres, "Domestic issues dominate by-election", ''The Times'', London, 14 June 1973, p.3.</ref> At the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]], he was the party's candidate for Truro. For the February 1974 general election, he stood at Manchester Central.<ref>''The Times'', London, 14 February 1974, p.7.</ref> In the 1979 European elections, he was the Liberal candidate for Greater Manchester North, where he was defeated by veteran [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Barbara Castle]].<ref>[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ "David Boothroyd's United Kingdom Election Results"].</ref> At the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], he was the Liberal Party candidate for Burnley.

In 1976, Steed designed the new system for the election of the Leader of the Liberal Party.<ref>"As Thorpe storm rises Steel says 'I'm staying'", ''The Observer'', London, 7 March 1976.</ref>

Steed was elected President of the Liberal Party 1978–79.<ref>"Next Liberal president", ''The Guardian'', 7 October 1977.</ref>

For many years, he was a leading light in the [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality]], serving on its executive committee and for a time as its treasurer. During a period of time when there was still great hostility to gay rights, he spoke out at public meetings, including an acrimonious one in [[Burnley]] in 1971 over the proposed establishment of a gay club, at which he shared the platform with [[Ray Gosling]]. This meeting has come to be seen as a watershed in the emergence of a national grassroots gay rights movement in Britain.<ref>"Tempers fly at 'club' meeting", ''Burnley Express'', 3 August 1971.</ref>

In 1975, with his former CHE colleague Paul Temperton, he founded ''Northern Democrat'', a magazine calling for democratic regional government.<ref>"Power to the North urged", ''The Guardian'', 7 February 1975.</ref><ref>"Growing concern in North at devolution proposals", ''The Times'', London, 4 November 1976, p.4.</ref> This later developed into the Campaign for the North, an all-party group pressing for devolution for the English regions; as well as Scotland and Wales, with Steed as chairman and Temperton as director, using funding from the Rowntree Trust.<ref>John Chartres, "Northern campaign against 'London chauvinism'", ''The Times'', London, 30 August 1977, p.3.</ref><ref>James Lewis, "Crying halt to South-east oligarchy: Northern grass roots movement seeks an end to 'over-centralisation'", ''The Guardian'', London, 23 May 1978.</ref>

==Retirement==
In his retirement, Steed has returned to his native [[East Kent]], where he remains active in local Liberal Democrat politics. In July 2008, he was elected to [[Canterbury City Council]].

He is currently Honorary Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the [[University of Kent]]. He has also been Senior Research Fellow of the Federal Trust.
He is a trustee of the Canterbury Commemoration Society, and a Vice-President of the [[Electoral Reform Society]], and was a Trustee of the Arthur McDougall Fund until 2017.

In 2012, Michael Steed was elected to the Council of the [[Social Liberal Forum]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://socialliberal.net/2012/09/09/social-liberal-forum-announce-newly-elected-council/ |publisher=Social Liberal Forum |date=9 September 2012 |title= Social Liberal Forum announce newly elected Council}}</ref>
