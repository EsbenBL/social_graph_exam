She is a co-author of ''The State of Working America 2002–3'' and ''Hardships in America: The Real Story of Working Families''.

Boushey was announced as chief economist on the Clinton-Kaine transition following the [[2016 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in July 2016.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

In 2019, she published ''Unbound: How Economic Inequality Constricts Our Economy and What We Can Do About It'', which was called "outstanding" and "piercing" by reviewers and named one of the best economics books of 2019 by [[Martin Wolf]] of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/39d5bd82-0bf5-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84|title=Subscribe to read {{!}} Financial Times|website=www.ft.com|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2019/10/16/the-distressing-growth-of-wealth-inequality-of-boomers/|title=The Distressing Growth Of Wealth Inequality Of Boomers|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614993/the-years-best-books-on-the-economy-we-live-in/|title=The best books in 2019 on the economy we live in|last=Rotman|first=David|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en-US|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> She is also the author of ''Finding Time: The Economics of Work-Life Conflict'' and a co-editor of ''[[After Piketty|After Piketty: The Agenda for Economics and Inequality]]'', a volume of 22 essays about how to integrate inequality into economic thinking.

In August 2020, Boushey was featured in a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article focusing on her role in the [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|Biden presidential campaign]] and the work that she and Equitable Growth have been doing in the wake of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]]. Shortly after Biden's victory in November 2020, it was announced that Boushey would serve as a member of Biden's [[Council of Economic Advisers]].<ref name="auto1" /><ref name="BidenAppointed" />

=== Analysis of women's participation in the labor force ===
In response to a series of articles in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that claimed that highly educated women were dropping out of the labor force because of "the motherhood movement", Boushey published results of [[econometric analysis]] that showed that the opposite was true and that these women, along with women and workers in the economy as a whole, were merely suffering the effects of the U.S. recession and [[jobless recovery]].<ref name="NYT 2008">{{cite news |last1=Uchitelle |first1=Louis |title=Economy drives women out of U.S. workforce |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/business/worldbusiness/22iht-jobs.4.14695747.html |access-date=September 2, 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=July 22, 2008}}</ref> [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] economists Emy Sok and Sharon Cohany found that, in 2005, the participation rate of married mothers with preschoolers was 60%, about 4 percentage points lower than its peak in 1997 and 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Emy|last1=Sok|first2=Sharon R.|last2=Cohany|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2007/02/art2full.pdf|title=Trends in labor force participation of married mothers of infants|journal=[[Monthly Labor Review]]|date=February 2007}}</ref> Economist Saul Hoffman found that, between 1984 and 2004, the presence of children has had a smaller negative impact on the labor force participation of all women aged 25–44 years. This finding confirms Boushey's report of a declining child penalty. However, this effect varies greatly by marital status: The labor force participation rate of ''single'' mothers aged 25–44 years increased 9 percentage points between 1993 and 2000, while the rate for single women aged 25–44 years with children aged 5 years or younger jumped a full 14 percentage points over the same period. In contrast, the labor force participation rate for ''married'' mothers increased 1 percentage point, and the rate for married women with children aged 5 years or younger was flat.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Saul D.|last=Hoffman|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2009/02/art1full.pdf|title=The changing impact of marriage and children on women's labor force participation|journal=[[Monthly Labor Review]]|date=February 2009}}</ref>

=== Criticism from staff ===
After Boushey's role in the Biden administration was announced, [[Claudia Sahm]], a former employee at Equitable Growth, accused her of mismanagement. Sahm claimed that she had been pushed out of her job after publishing a blog post regarding [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[elitism]] in economics that Boushey took issue with. Equitable Growth denied Sahm's account. [[WikiLeaks|Wikileaks]] documents mention that five former staff members cited Boushey's management as a factor in their resignations.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-12-02|title=Biden CEA Pick Heather Boushey Criticized by Former Staffer|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/biden-cea-pick-boushey-criticized-by-former-staffer-sahm|access-date=2020-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Biden top economic adviser facing accusations of mismanagement, verbal abuse|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/02/biden-economic-adviser-heather-boushey-mismanagement-442408|access-date=2020-12-03|website=POLITICO|language=en}}</ref>

== Personal life ==

On March 31, 2007, Boushey married [[Todd Tucker]],<ref name="nyt marriage" /> formerly research director of the [[Global Trade Watch]] division of [[Public Citizen]], who specializes in the legal, economic, and political consequences of [[trade agreement]]s, including the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).
