==History==

===Founding and early history===
[[File:Iowa_old_capitol_1855.jpg|thumb|right|[[Iowa Old Capitol Building]], Iowa City, 1855]]

The University of Iowa was founded on February 25, 1847, just 59 days after Iowa was admitted to the [[United States|Union]]. The Constitution of the State of Iowa refers to a State University to be established in Iowa City "without branches at any other place."<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCartney|first1=David|title=University Archivist|url=http://spectator.uiowa.edu/2010/december/oldgold.html|publisher=The University of Iowa Spectator|access-date=December 14, 2014|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68TA5cHcR?url=http://spectator.uiowa.edu/2010/december/oldgold.html|archive-date=June 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The legal name of the university is the '''State University of Iowa''', but the [[Iowa Board of Regents|Board of Regents]] approved using "'''The University of Iowa'''" for everyday usage in October 1964.<ref>Board of Regents minutes, October 21–24, 1964, pages 170-171</ref>

The first faculty offered instruction at the university beginning in March 1855 to students in the Old Mechanics Building, located where Seashore Hall is now. In September 1855, there were 124 students, of whom forty-one were women. The 1856–57 catalog listed nine departments offering [[Classical language|ancient languages]], modern languages, intellectual [[philosophy]], [[moral philosophy]], [[history]], [[natural history]], [[mathematics]], [[natural philosophy]], and [[chemistry]]. The first president of the university was [[Amos Dean]].

The original campus consisted of the [[Iowa Old Capitol Building]] and the {{convert|10|acre|m2}} (4.05 hectares) of land on which it stood. Following the placing of the cornerstone July 4, 1840, the building housed the Fifth Legislative Assembly of the [[Territory of Iowa]] (December 5, 1842) and then became the first capitol building of the State of Iowa on December 28, 1846. Until that date, it had been the third capitol of the Territory of Iowa. When the capitol of Iowa was moved to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] in 1857, the Old Capitol became the first permanent "home" of the University.

In 1855, the university became the first public university in the United States to [[list of mixed-sex colleges and universities in the United States|admit men and women on an equal basis]]. In addition, Iowa was the world's first university to accept creative work in theater, writing, music, and art on an equal basis with academic research.<ref name="University of Iowa Firsts">{{cite web | title=University of Iowa Firsts| url=http://www.uiowa.edu/facts/UI-firsts/index.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515022742/http://www.uiowa.edu/facts/UI-firsts/index.htm| archive-date=May 15, 2006}}</ref>

The university was one of the first institutions in America to grant a law degree to a woman ([[Mary B. Hickey Wilkinson]], 1873), to grant a law degree to an African American ([[Alexander Clark|Alexander G. Clark, Jr.]] in 1879), and to put an African American on a varsity athletic squad ([[Frank Holbrook]] in 1895). The university awarded its first [[doctorate]] in 1898.<ref name="University of Iowa Firsts"/>

===20th century–present===

The university was the first state university to recognize the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Allied Union (in 1970).<ref name="University of Iowa Firsts"/>

The University of Iowa established the first law school west of the [[Mississippi River]]. It was the first university to use television in education, in 1932, and it pioneered in the field of [[standardized testing]].<ref>{{Cite news | title=About Iowa – The University of Iowa| url=http://www.uiowa.edu/homepage/about-UI/index.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407024607/http://www.uiowa.edu/homepage/about-UI/index.html| archive-date=April 7, 2005}}</ref> Also, the University of Iowa was the first Big Ten institution to promote an African American to the position of administrative vice president. ([[Phillip Hubbard]], promoted in 1966)

Under the leadership of Carl Seashore in 1922, Iowa became the first university in the United States to accept creative projects as theses for advanced degrees. Traditionally, graduate study culminates in the writing of a scholarly thesis, but Iowa accepted creative works including a collection of poems, a musical composition, or a series of paintings to  be presented to the graduate college in support of a degree. In so doing, Iowa established a creative standard in qualifying for the Master of Fine Arts degree and secured a place for writers and artists in the academy. The university's Program in Creative Writing, known worldwide as the [[Iowa Writers’ Workshop]], was founded in 1936 with the gathering together of writers of both poetry and fiction. It was the first creative writing program in the country, and it became the prototype for more than 300 writing programs, many of which were founded by Workshop alumni. The workshop remains the most prestigious creative writing program in the country and one of the most selective graduate programs of any kind, typically admitting fewer than five percent of its applicants.

In 2015, the [[Iowa Board of Regents]] selected [[Bruce Harreld]], a business consultant with limited experience in academic administration, to succeed Sally Mason as president. The regents' choice of Harreld provoked criticism and controversy on the UI campus due to his corporate background, lack of history in leading an institution of higher education, and the circumstances related to the search process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-Controversial-Search-Ends/232861/|title=A Controversial Search Ends With a Controversial Chief for the U. of Iowa|last1=Kelderman|first1=Eric|date=September 4, 2015|last2=Mcintire|first2=Mary Ellen|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|issn=0009-5982|access-date=May 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625044231/http://chronicle.com/article/A-Controversial-Search-Ends/232861/|archive-date=June 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/higher-education/university-of-iowa-liberal-arts-college-faculty-rebukes-new-president-20150924|title=University of Iowa Liberal arts college faculty rebukes new president {{!}} The Gazette|website=The Gazette|access-date=May 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617084919/http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/higher-education/university-of-iowa-liberal-arts-college-faculty-rebukes-new-president-20150924|archive-date=June 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/do-businesspeople-make-good-university-presidents|title=Do Businesspeople Make Good University Presidents?|last=Vara|first=Vauhini|date=September 10, 2015|newspaper=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|access-date=May 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520112615/http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/do-businesspeople-make-good-university-presidents|archive-date=May 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/higher-education/regents-acted-in-bad-faith-in-university-of-iowa-president-search-aaup-concludes-20151210|title=Regents acted 'in bad faith' in University of Iowa president search, AAUP concludes {{!}} The Gazette|website=The Gazette|access-date=May 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421052649/http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/higher-education/regents-acted-in-bad-faith-in-university-of-iowa-president-search-aaup-concludes-20151210|archive-date=April 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  The regents said they had based their decision on the belief that Harreld could limit costs and find new sources of revenue beyond tuition in an age of declining state support for universities.<ref name=":0" />

==Campus==

[[File:University of Iowa Collegiate Gothic.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics|General Hospital's]] [[collegiate Gothic]] tower is prevalent on the west side of campus]]
[[File:Seamans Center Iowa City Iowa 2002-12-08.jpeg|thumb|right|Seamans Center for the Engineering Arts and Sciences]]

The University of Iowa's main campus is located in [[Iowa City]]. The campus is roughly bordered by Park Road and U.S. Highway 6 to the north and Dubuque and Gilbert Streets to the east. The [[Iowa River]] flows through the campus, dividing it into west and east sides.

Of architectural note is the [[Pentacrest]] which comprises five major buildings&mdash;[[Iowa Old Capitol Building|Old Capitol]], Schaeffer Hall, MacLean Hall, Macbride Hall, and Jessup Hall&mdash;at the center of the University of Iowa Campus. The Pentacrest reflects the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] in addition to [[Greek Revival]] architectural styles and the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture, which is dominant in sections of the campus east of the [[Iowa River]]. The Old Capitol was once the home of the state legislature and the primary government building for the State of Iowa but is now the symbolic heart of the university with a restored ceremonial legislative chamber and a museum of Iowa history.

Also on the east side of the campus are six residence halls (Burge, Daum, Stanley, Currier, Mayflower, and Catlett), the Iowa Memorial Union, the [[Women's Resource & Action Center]], the Pappajohn Business Building, Seamans Center for the Engineering Arts and Sciences, the Lindquist Center ([[University of Iowa College of Education|home of the College of Education]]), Phillips Hall (the foreign language building), Van Allen Hall (home to physics and astronomy), Trowbridge Hall (home to Earth & Environmental Sciences, as well as the Iowa Geological Survey), the English-Philosophy Building, the Becker Communication Building, the Adler Journalism Building, [[Voxman Music Building]], and the buildings for biology, chemistry, and psychology. The Main Library can also be found on the east side.

The Colleges of Law, Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and [[Public health]] are on the west side of the Iowa River, along with the [[University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics]], and the Theatre Building. Additionally, five residence halls (Hillcrest, Slater, Rienow, Parklawn, and Petersen), [[Kinnick Stadium]], and [[Carver-Hawkeye Arena]] are located on the west campus.

The campus is home to several museums, including the [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]], the [[Iowa Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]], the Old Capitol Museum, the Medical Museum, the Athletic Hall of Fame and Museum, and Project Art at the University Hospitals and Clinics.

A flood of the Iowa River in 2008 had a major impact on several campus buildings, forcing many to temporarily or permanently close. The Iowa Memorial Union was closed for some time while its lower level was renovated. The arts campus, which included Hancher Auditorium, Voxman Music Building, Clapp Recital Hall, and the Theatre Building, sustained significant damage. Hancher Auditorium was rebuilt near its current site on the West bank of the Iowa River, and Voxman Music Hall was constructed adjacent to downtown Iowa City and the main campus on South Clinton Street. The new Hancher Auditorium and the new Voxman Music Building opened in 2016.

The Oakdale Campus, which is home to some of the university's research facilities and the driving simulator, is located north of [[Interstate 80]] in adjacent [[Coralville, Iowa|Coralville]].

===Campus Public Art Collection===

The University of Iowa holds and continues to commission an extensive collection of public art. The program began under the Iowa State 'Art in State Buildings Program,' one of the first percent for art programs in the United States<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-12-19|title=Art in State Buildings|url=https://iowaculture.gov/arts/opportunities/calls-artists/art-state-buildings|access-date=2020-07-11|website=IDCA|language=en}}</ref> since repealed in 2017. The collection includes many important works, including works by artists: Sol LeWitt (2-3-1-1, 1994); [[El Anatsui]] (Anonymous Creature 2009); [[Dale Chihuly]] (Forest Amber and Gilded Chandelier, 2004); [[Auguste Rodin|August Rodin]] (Jean de Fiennes, draped, 1889); [[Peter Randall-Page]] (Ridge and Furrow, 2011).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Art on Campus {{!}} Facilities Management|url=https://www.facilities.uiowa.edu/campus-spaces/art-campus|access-date=2020-07-11|website=www.facilities.uiowa.edu}}</ref>
