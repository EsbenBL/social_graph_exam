===The state and democracy===
Munck, in his work with [[Sebastián L. Mazzuca]], has advanced the argument that the process of [[state formation]], and the resulting level of [[state capacity]], affects the process of democratization as well as the quality of democracy. In ''A Middle-quality Institutional Trap'' (2020), Mazzuca and Munck maintain that "States can make democracy and democracy can make States," but that they do so "only under certain macroconditions, which trigger the causal mechanisms that make the State–democracy interaction a virtuous cycle." They compare advanced democracies to Latin America and show that "in Latin America, the State–democracy interaction has not generated a virtuous cycle." They explain the poor quality of Latin American democracies in terms of various factors, including the legacy of state formation in the nineteenth century.<ref>Sebastián L. Mazzuca and Gerardo L. Munck, ''A Middle-quality Institutional Trap: Democracy and State Capacity in Latin America.'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2020, p. 63.</ref>
