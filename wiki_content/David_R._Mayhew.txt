==Writings==
In ''[[Congress: The Electoral Connection]]'', Mayhew argued that much of the organization of the [[United States Congress]] can be explained as the result of re-election seeking behavior by its members. In ''Divided We Govern'', he disputed the previously accepted notion that, when Congress and the presidency are controlled by different parties, less important legislation is passed than under unified government. The book won the 1992 Richard E. Neustadt prize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/|title=Welcome &#124; Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu}}</ref> Princeton professor R. Douglas Arnold, another student of Mayhew's, noted that the academic literature on Congress can be cleanly categorized as coming “before” or “after” ''Congress: The Electoral Connection''.<ref>{{Cite web|title="Wisdom and Humility:" A Fitting Tribute to David Mayhew {{!}} Institution for Social and Policy Studies|url=https://isps.yale.edu/news/blog/2013/06/%E2%80%9Cwisdom-and-humility%E2%80%9D-a-fitting-tribute-to-david-mayhew|access-date=2021-04-30|website=isps.yale.edu}}</ref>

His 2011 book, ''Partisan Balance: Why Political Parties Don't Kill the U.S. Constitutional System'' (Princeton University Press, 2011), contends that majoritarianism largely characterizes the American system. The wishes of the majority tend to nudge institutions back toward the median voter. ''Partisan Balance'' won the 2011 Leon D. Epstein Outstanding Award from the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref>http://blog.press.princeton.edu/2011/05/16/david-mayhew-wins-the-2011-leon-d-epstein-award/</ref>

In his most recent work, ''The Imprint of Congress'', Mayhew makes a case for studying the consequences of Congress's activities, not just the aspirations, processes, and optics associated with those activities.  The book analyzes congressional participation in a series of policy impulses that have invested the United States from the 1790s through recent times.
