==Career==
Conley is best known for his contributions to understanding how health and [[socioeconomic status]] are transmitted across generations. To this end, his research has examined the role of family wealth (as distinct from income) in status attainment, investigated the role of prenatal environment and birth weight on educational outcomes, addressed the causes and consequences of sibling differences in class status; and explored gene-environment interactions in family and economic life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.princeton.edu/faculty/dalton-conley|title=Dalton Conley - Princeton University Faculty Bio|date=2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816124753/https://sociology.princeton.edu/faculty/dalton-conley|archive-date=2016-08-16}}</ref>

His first book, ''[[Being Black, Living in the Red]]'' (1999), focuses on the role of family wealth in perpetuating class advantages and racial inequalities in the [[Post–civil rights era in African-American history|post-Civil Rights era]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Being Black, Living in the Red|last=Conley|first=Dalton|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=9780520261303}}</ref>

He has studied the role of health in the status attainment process. A seminal article entitled, "Is Biology Destiny: Birth Weight and Life Chances" (with Neil G. Bennett, American Sociological Review 1999) and his second book, which emerged from this and related pieces, ''The Starting Gate: Birth Weight and Life Chances'' (with Kate Strully and Neil G. Bennett, 2003) showed the importance of [[birth weight]] and [[prenatal]] health to later socioeconomic outcomes, reversing the typical way sociologists viewed the health-economics relationship and anticipated a robust research literature on early life health conditions as they affect later socioeconomic processes and outcomes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Starting Gate: Birth Weight and Life Chances|last=Conley|first=Dalton|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520239555|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/startinggatebirt0000conl}}</ref>

''The Pecking Order'', which followed in 2004, showed the importance of within-family, ascriptive factors in determining sibling differences in socioeconomic success, thereby challenging the usual association of intra-household differences with the greater salience of achievement and/or meritocracy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Pecking Order: Which Siblings Succeed and Why |last=Conley|first=Dalton|publisher=Pantheon|year=2004|isbn=0375421742|url=https://archive.org/details/peckingorderwhic00conl}}</ref>

''Elsewhere, U.S.A.: How We Got from the Company Man, Family Dinners and the Affluent Society to the Home Office, BlackBerry Moms and Economic Anxiety'' (2009) chronicles how American society has moved from embodying [[Max Weber]]'s Protestant ethic in the 19th and early 20th centuries to [[William H. Whyte]]'s "social ethic" during the mid-20th century to today's "elsewhere ethic", in which the pressure from high and rising income inequality within the knowledge economy interacts with telecommunications technologies to shift the income elasticity of labor supply such that higher skilled professionals work ever longer hours, thereby altering family life and tearing down once-sacrosanct boundaries of the modern era such as those between work and leisure, public and private, and even self and other.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elsewhere, U.S.A.: How We Got from the Company Man, Family Dinners, and the Affluent Society to the Home Office, BlackBerry Moms, and Economic Anxiety|last=Conley|first=Dalton|publisher=Pantheon|year=2009|isbn=978-0375422904|url=https://archive.org/details/elsewhereusa00conl}}</ref>

In 2014, he published the satirical book, ''Parentology: Everything You Wanted to Know About the Science of Raising Children but Were Too Exhausted to Ask''. This book uses his own quirky parenting decisions—such as naming his first child a letter of the alphabet, getting his kids as many pets as possible in their NYC apartment, and setting up a homework economy of bribery—as a trope to humorously discuss the science of child development.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parentology: Everything You Wanted to Know About the Science of Raising Children but Were Too Exhausted to Ask|last=Conley|first=Dalton|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2014|isbn=978-1476712659}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/36898/parentology-parenting-with-science-and-experimentation/|title=Parent Like a Mad Scientist |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2014}}</ref>

In 2017, his newest book, ''The Genome Factor: What the Social Genomics Revolution Reveals About Ourselves, Our History and the Future'' (Princeton University Press), co-authored with Jason Fletcher, will be released.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10801.html|title=The Genome Factor - Princeton University Press|date=24 January 2017|isbn=9780691164748|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|last2=Fletcher|first2=Jason}}</ref> This volume argues that the nature-nurture debate is over.  Now that many large scale social surveys collect genetic data, researchers who study behavior and social life can obtain a complete picture of how the forces of genetics and the environment interact to produce human outcomes. Conley and Fletcher address topics ranging from the role of genes in social mobility, genetic and social assortative mating, the difference between race and genetic ancestry and the potential rise of a genotocracy as foreshadowed by the 1997 film, [[Gattaca]].

His best-selling introduction to sociology textbook is ''You May Ask Yourself'', currently in its 6th edition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist |last=Conley|first=Dalton|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2015|isbn=978-0393937732}}</ref>

In addition to these works, Conley is the author of the acclaimed sociological memoir ''Honky'' (2000), which examines Conley's own childhood growing up white in an inner-city neighborhood of housing projects of New York City. ''Honky'' explores the intersection of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]] in America, outlining the subtle but profoundly important privileges even an impoverished white boy enjoys over his darker-skinned peers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Honky|last=Conley|first=Dalton|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|isbn=0520215869|url=https://archive.org/details/honky00conl}}</ref>

Conley's work has also appeared in many mainstream media publications. He has written many op-ed pieces for ''[[The New York Times]]'' on topics ranging from the calculation of slavery reparations to roommate random assignment to the dividend tax and its relation to corporate personhood. He is frequently interviewed for articles on race, family, and socioeconomic status.
