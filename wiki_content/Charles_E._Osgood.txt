== Early life and education ==
Charles Egerton Osgood was born in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], on 20 November 1916.<ref name=":0" /> His father was a manager at the [[Jordan Marsh]] department store in Boston.<ref name=":0" /> Osgood described having an unhappy childhood as his parents were divorced by the time he was six.<ref name=":0" /> When he was ten, his aunt, Grace Osgood, gave him a copy of [[Roget's Thesaurus|Roget's ''Thesaurus'']].<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /> This gift was described by Osgood an “object of aesthetic pleasure”, sparking his fascination with words and their meanings.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" />

Osgood attended [[Brookline High School]], where he began writing for the school newspaper, and eventually founded a school magazine.<ref name=":0" /> Osgood attended [[Dartmouth College]] where he intended to graduate and work as a writer for newspapers. During his second year, he enrolled in a class taught by Theodore Karwoski, thus inspiring him to switch his major in order to pursue a degree in psychology.

Charles Osgood earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1939 from Dartmouth, and in the same year, married Cynthia Luella Thornton.<ref name=":5">{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Staff|title=Osgood, Charles Egerton (1916–1991)|date=2010|encyclopedia=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|pages=1|publisher=American Cancer Society|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0627|isbn=9780470479216}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Citation|last=Rieber|first=Robert W.|chapter=Osgood, Charles|date=2012|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the History of Psychological Theories|pages=746–748|editor-last=Rieber|editor-first=Robert W.|publisher=Springer US|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0463-8_259|isbn=9781441904638}}</ref> Osgood then went on to study at [[Yale University]] where he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1945.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0" /> During his time at Yale, he worked as an assistant for Robert Sears, and collaborated with the likes of [[Arnold Gesell]], [[Walter Richard Miles|Walter Miles]], Charles Morris, and Irvin Child.

Hull|Clark Hull]].<ref name=":0" /> Though Osgood was heavily influenced through working alongside Hull; he stated the experience was one of the determining reasons for him pursuing a career as a researcher, rather than a clinician.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=A History of psychology in autobiography.|date=1930|publisher=Clark University Press|others=Murchison, Carl, 1887-1961,, Boring, Edwin Garrigues, 1886-1968|isbn=0804714924|location=Worcester, Mass.|oclc=964288}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

==Career==
Osgood was a [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] interested in psycholinguistics, and research. He was an instructor at Yale from 1942 to 1946, where he earned his doctorate degree.<ref name=":2" /> He worked for the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development 1946 to 1947, serving as a research associate that worked on training of B-29 gunners.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of special education : a reference for the education of children, adolescents, and adults with disabilities and other exceptional individuals|last=Reynolds, Vannest, Flecher-Janzen|first=Cecil, Kimberly, Elaine|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2014|isbn=9780470949405|location=Hoboken, New Jersey}}</ref> During this period, Osgood also worked as an assistant professor of psychology at the [[University of Connecticut]] from 1946 to 1949.<ref name=":5" /> Osgood then went on to become an associate professor at the University of Connecticut from 1949 to 1952, and eventually as professor of psychology and communications from 1952 onward.<ref name=":3" /> He completed a majority of his work during his time at the University of Illinois, Urbana, which, along with the Institute of Communications, funded many of his works.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=No Boundaries: University of Illinois Vignettes|last=Hoddeson|first=Lillian|publisher=Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|year=2004|isbn=0-252-02957-7|location=United States of America|pages=[https://archive.org/details/noboundariesuniv0000unse/page/218 218-220]|url=https://archive.org/details/noboundariesuniv0000unse/page/218}}</ref> Osgood would often submit himself to his own experiments get a better grasp of what his subjects may experience.<ref name=":02" /> At Illinois, Osgood was active in aiding in the hiring processes, and even arranged interviews for women at the university during times when women were facing sexism in the field of psychology.<ref name=":02" /> From 1957 to 1965, Osgood served as the Director of the Institute of Communications Research, and starting in 1965, he became the Director of the Center for Advanced Study.<ref name=":3" /> He was also elected as the director of the Centre of Comparative Psycholinguistics at the university from 1963 to 1982.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/51920.html|title=Charles E. Osgood|website=National Academy of Sciences|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref>

In addition to this,Osgood completed a fellowship at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] at Stanford University from 1958 to 1959;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://casbs.stanford.edu/people/charles-e-osgood|title=Charles E. Osgood {{!}} Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences|website=casbs.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> and was given an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Dartmouth College in 1962.<ref name=":3" /> Osgood also acted as a visiting professor at the [[University of Hawaii]] from 1964 to 1965.<ref name=":3" />

==Death and unfinished research==
Charles Osgood's career ended somewhat abruptly and prematurely after developing an acute case of [[Korsakoff syndrome|Korsakoff's syndrome]].<ref name=":0" /> He was left with severe [[anterograde amnesia]], but recovered well enough to continue working, though in a much lighter capacity as he was restricted to working from home.<ref name=":0" />

Toward the end of his career, Osgood decided to devote his time to three main projects. With the help of other scholars, Osgood intended on completing the interpretation of data obtained from the cross-cultural project; along with publishing 2 books, one of them, a summary of his theory of psycholinguistics (to be titled ''Toward an Abstract Performance Grammar''), and the other on international affairs.<ref name=":0" /> Osgood was never able to complete any of these due to the effects of his illness, which, after a few years, forced him into complete retirement, until his death on September 15, 1991.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0" />

== Works and contributions ==
Osgood worked on many studies mainly on [[cross-cultural studies]] in different aspects. He devoted most of his time to studies regarding [[Social psychology|Social Psychology]], Cognitive-Behaviour Psychology and also on [[Psycholinguistics]]. He was renowned for four of his major works and these works have pathed the way for future researchers by facilitating them for validating their works with researches tools proposed by Osgood, also promoting international research studies on cross-cultural topics.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Tzeng|first1=Oliver C.S.|last2=Landis|first2=Dan|last3=Tzeng|first3=Diana Y.|date=2012|title=Charles E.

===Mediation theory===
Osgood's Mediation theory&mdash;The [[psycholinguistics]] foundations in human behaviour and communication process.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=OSGOOD|first=CHARLES E.|title=Commentary on "the Semantic Differential and Mediation Theory"|date=1971|journal=Linguistics|volume=9|issue=66|doi=10.1515/ling.1971.9.66.88|s2cid=144893813|issn=0024-3949}}</ref>

Osgood proposed the mediation theory which suggested that the physical stimuli exist in our environment have elicited our internal response and lead to our interpretation of the underlined meaning of those presented stimulus. With our 3-level of thought process, we will have our internal stimuli, which are our thoughts and emotion towards the physical stimulus and the internal stimulus will bring up the outward response(s), which are visible feedbacks to the physical stimulus in the environment. Osgood also suggested that by measuring the visible outward response we can determine the intensity of emotion that has been brought up by the physical stimulus.<ref name=":7" />

Osgood also proposed a two-stage Meditation learning theory in the language acquisition process in 1954. The theory suggested that the use of language is an expression of mental process which is related to the cultural context of an individual. It suggested that the language acquisition process involves coding and decoding of the psychological structure within the language. His research in [[language]], [[cognition]], and [[neurophysiology]] had provided insight into future studies about multilingual language acquisition with a cross-cultural framework.<ref name=":6" />

===Semantic technique&mdash;the cross-cultural research tool ===
Osgood introduced a semantic technique for researchers to measure the connotative meaning of objects and concepts from the human Ecology aspect. The Semantic differential technique focused on three affective dimensions of Evaluation, Potency, and Activity (E-P-A) to evaluate social and cultural related concepts in a valid and reliable way. The practice of the semantic differential technique is being used broadly in social and behavioural science studies.<ref name=":6" />

=== Development of the atlas of affectivemeanings (1960s–1980s)===
To further improve the validity of the semantic differential technique, Osgood took the lead to develop the Atlas of Affective Meanings project from the 1960s to the 1980s. The project is indices of the affective meanings with 20 basic and derived measures of over 600 functionally equivalent concepts by analyzing over 30 language/culture communities from Mexico, Brazil, Japan, [[Hong Kong]], Thailand, India, Iran, Lebanon, Israel, Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, German, Netherlands, Finland, etc.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Francis M.|last2=Osgood|first2=Charles E.|date=1973|title=A Cross-Cultural Study of the Affective Meanings of Color|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=135–156|doi=10.1177/002202217300400201|s2cid=145582905|issn=0022-0221}}</ref>

With the development of the Atlas, affective meanings are used as universal functional markers with the E-P-A dimension and they have high validity in measuring indigenous and cross-cultural comparisons. These affective meanings are being widely applied on social-cultural studies on [[social dynamics]], [[international communication]], mental illness [[Social stigma|stigma]] and connotation of racial concepts, etc. It has a great contribution to the development of cross-cultural researches and also international communications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Osgood|first=Charles E.|title=Objective Indicators of Subjective Culture|date=1977|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=285|issue=1 Issues in Cro|pages=435–450|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1977.tb29371.x|bibcode=1977NYASA.285..435O|s2cid=85653053|issn=0077-8923}}</ref><ref name=":6" />

===Graduated reciprocation in tension reduction (GRIT) strategies ===
With the rise of the [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]] race that was brought up by the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. Osgood proposed the GRIT strategies (Graduated Reciprocation in Tension reduction) in 1962, which means to provide a psychological approach to resolve the tension brought up from the nuclear arm race between the two superpowers. The GRIT strategies are based on the concept of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] and used to rebuild a negotiation platform for two parties who are deadlocked. The introduction of GRIT strategies not only reduced the tension between the two superpowers but also has contributed to solving various social, cultural and political conflicts worldwide.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindskold|first=Svenn|date=1978|title=Trust development, the GRIT proposal, and the effects of conciliatory acts on conflict and cooperation.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=85|issue=4|pages=772–793|doi=10.1037//0033-2909.85.4.772|issn=0033-2909}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=An alternatives to war or surrender, 2. printing|last=Osgood, Charles E.|date=1970|oclc=474006160}}</ref><ref name=":6" />
