==Life and career==
Thomas Attwood was born in [[Halesowen]], then a detached part of [[Shropshire]], and attended Halesowen Grammar School (now [[Earls High School]]) before being moved to [[Wolverhampton Grammar School]]. On 12 May 1806, Attwood married Elizabeth Carless from Lower Ravenhurst Farm, an area which is now part of the [[Moor Pool]] estate.<ref name=Family>{{cite book|last=Moss|first=David J|title=Thomas Attwood: The Biography of a Radical|url=https://archive.org/details/thomasattwoodbio0000moss|url-access=registration|date=1990|page=[https://archive.org/details/thomasattwoodbio0000moss/page/31 31]|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0-7735-0708-6}}</ref> They had two sons, George de Bosco Attwood (15 March 1808), who stood unsuccessfully for the [[Walsall (UK Parliament constituency)|Walsall constituency]] in the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832 general election]], and Thomas Aurelius Attwood (4 March 1810).<ref name=Family /> Their daughter Angela married [[Daniel Wakefield (judge)|Daniel Wakefield]] with whom she emigrated to New Zealand.<ref>{{cite book |title=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage|Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manatū Taonga]] |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/wakefield-daniel/1 | editor-first=A.

He founded the [[Birmingham Political Union]] in 1830. This was a political organization campaigning for cities, and large towns such as Birmingham, to be directly represented in Parliament. The Birmingham Political Union was foremost among groups lobbying the government for the passage of a [[Reform Bill]] to achieve this aim. The [[Days of May]] in 1832 brought the people's struggle for wider [[enfranchisement]] to a head, and the [[Great Reform Act]] was passed on 15 May 1832. After this success he became one of the first two [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) for [[Birmingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham]] (along with [[Joshua Scholefield]]) on 12 December 1832, a position he held until 1839.

Attwood lived at [[Grove Park, Birmingham|The Grove]], a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house in [[Harborne]], [[Birmingham]], between 1823 and 1846. He died in [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]] in 1856.

A [[grade II listed]] statue of Thomas Attwood by local sculptor [[Peter Hollins]] stood in Calthorpe Park from 1859 to 1974<ref>Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851 by Rupert Gunnis</ref> then moved to Larches Green, Sparkbrook, Birmingham between 1974 and 2008, but is now in store. A 1993 bronze statue sat, having left his plinth, and scattered his bronze pages, on the steps of [[Chamberlain Square]] in Birmingham until 2016 when works to demolish the Central Library and rebuild Chamberlain Square began. The statue was reinstalled in 2020 once the works were completed.

Attwood Street, a residential street in [[Halesowen]], commemorates his achievements.
