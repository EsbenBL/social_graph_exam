In 1972 Visco began his career at the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]] and in 1990 he was named head of the research department; from 1997 to 2002 he was chief economist of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] ([[OECD]]) and on 9 January 2007 he was named deputy director general of the Bank of Italy (alongside Giovanni Carosio) and a member of its ''Direttorio'' (Board of Directors).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Finanza%20e%20Mercati/2006/12/bankitalia201206bocciarelli.shtml?uuid=47e0cc00-9007-11db-bf71-00000e25108c&DocRulesView=Libero|title=Giovanni Carosio e Ignazio Visco nel Direttorio di Bankitalia|author=Bocciarelli, Rossella|work=Il Sole 24 Ore|date=20 December 2006|access-date=21 October 2011|language=it}}</ref>

On 24 October 2011 Visco was named to succeed [[Mario Draghi]] as governor of the Bank of Italy by [[President of Italy|Italian President]] [[Giorgio Napolitano]].<ref name="berlu"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Italian President Signs Decree to Name Visco Bank of Italy Head|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-24/italian-president-signs-decree-to-name-visco-bank-of-italy-head.html|date=24 October 2011|first=Jeffrey|last=Donovan|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref>

Starting from 1 January 2013, in accordance with Legislative Decree 95/12 (converted into law, with modifications, from Law no.135/2012), he also holds the position of chairman of the joint governing board of the [[Italian Insurance Supervisory Authority]] ([[IVASS]]).{{fact|date=September 2018}}

During his time in office, Visco came under fire for failing to effectively tackle Italy’s banking woes. In October 2017, the country’s ruling centre-left Democratic Party submitted a motion in parliament calling for new leadership at the Bank of Italy, casting doubt on Visco’s chances of being reappointed to a second term.<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Politi | date=17 October 2017 | url=https://www.ft.com/content/d7969083-e06f-39a7-9579-7e1c51e054cd?mhq5j=e7 | title=Italy's ruling party looks to oust central bank chief | work=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref> Following a proposal made by Prime Minister [[Paolo Gentiloni]] and his cabinet to renominate Visco and the endorsement of the Bank of Italy’s high council, however, President [[Sergio Mattarella]] signed a decree to reappoint Visco for a second six-year term.<ref>Giada Zampano (27 October 2017), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-19/un-s-61-billion-pension-fund-gets-new-chief-after-shortfalls UN's $61 Billion Pension Fund Gets New Chief After Shortfalls] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Politi | date=27 October 2017 | url=https://www.ft.com/content/9ef74470-f704-3f2f-b065-e6ce69598435 | title=Italian president approves Visco second term as Bank of Italy governor | work=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref><ref>Steve Scherer and Gavin Jones (27 October 2017), [https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-italy/bank-of-italys-visco-gets-second-term-despite-renzi-dissent-idUKKBN1CW1J9 Bank of Italy's Visco gets second term despite Renzi dissent] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>
