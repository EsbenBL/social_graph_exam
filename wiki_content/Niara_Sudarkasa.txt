==Biography==
Niara Sudarkasa was born Gloria Albertha Marshall on August 14, 1938, in [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]. Niara was a [[gifted student]] who skipped several grades in [[primary school|elementary]]. She graduated from high school and accepted early admission to [[Fisk University]] on a [[Ford Foundation]] scholarship when she was 15 years old. She left Fisk and transferred to [[Oberlin College]], where she earned a Bachelor's Degree in 1957.<ref>{{Citation|last=Burgess|first=Marjorie|title=Sudarkasa, Niara 1938–|date=1993|work=Contemporary Black Biography|volume=4|pages=239–240|editor-last=Bigelow|editor-first=Barbara Carlisle|publisher=Gale|language=English}}</ref>  She received her [[master's degree]] in anthropology from [[Columbia University]]. While completing her Ph.D. she taught at Columbia University, becoming the first [[African-American]] woman to teach there when she earned her [[Ph.D.]] in 1964.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.aed.org/About/Niara_Sudarkasa.cfm "Niara Sudarkasa"].

Soon after earning her Ph.D., Sudarkasa was appointed assistant professor of anthropology at [[New York University]], the first black woman to hold that position. She was also the first African American to be appointed to the Department of Anthropology at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1969. While at Michigan, she became involved in civil rights and student issues. When she left Michigan in 1986, Sudarkasa became the first female to serve as president of [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in [[Pennsylvania]].

During Surdarkasa's presidency at Lincoln University the school increased enrollment, strengthened its undergraduate and international programs and put into place an ambitious minority recruitment effort.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the late 1990s, after concerns over improper use of university funds, nepotism, and other financial irregularities led the state to withhold its $11m budget contribution, Sudarkas resigned from Lincoln University.<ref>[http://diverseeducation.com/article/8587/# Sudarkasa’s epilogue – Niara Sudarkasa, Lincoln University – Interview]</ref><ref>[http://diverseeducation.com/article/8586/# Sudarkasa resigns in wake of state’s audit report – Lincoln University, Niara Sudarkasa]</ref><ref>[http://diverseeducation.com/article/8555/# Art, audits, and allegations – Lincoln University, President Niara Sudarkasa]</ref><ref>[http://articles.philly.com/1998-09-16/news/25756914_1_severance-package-lincoln-president-physical-plant Lincoln U.
