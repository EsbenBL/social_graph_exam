==Background and education==
John Geanakoplos was born to a [[Greek Americans|Greek-American]] family of scholars. His father was the late Professor Emeritus at Yale [[Deno Geanakoplos]] ({{lang-el|Κωνσταντίνος Γιαννακόπουλος}}), a renowned [[Greek Americans|Greek-American]] historian of Byzantine cultural and religious history, and his mother, Effie Geanakoplos, was an instructor in psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: Deno Geanakoplos|url=http://news.yale.edu/2007/10/11/memoriam-deno-geanakoplos|work=Yale News|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=2017-06-21|date=October 11, 2007}}</ref> In 1970 Geanakoplos won the [[U.S. Open Chess Championship|United States Junior Open Chess Championship]]. He received his B.A. in mathematics from Yale University in 1975 ([[summa cum laude]]), and his M.A. in mathematics and his Ph.D. in economics under [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Jerry R. Green|Jerry Green]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1980. In 1980 he became an assistant professor of economics at Yale University, rising to associate professor in 1983, full professor in 1986, and the James Tobin Professor of Economics in 1994.

==Professional career==

In 1996-2005 Geanakoplos was director of the [[Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics]].  He was a co-founder in 2002, and is still currently co-director, of the Hellenic Studies Program at Yale.  He was elected a fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] in 1990, and of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999. He was awarded the
[[Samuelson Prize]] in 1999, and was awarded the first [[Bodossaki Prize]] in economics in
1994 for the best economist of [[Greek American|Greek heritage]] under 40. In 1990-1991 and again in
1999-2000 he directed the economics program at the [[Santa Fe Institute]], where he remains
an external professor and chairman of the science steering committee.  In 2009-2010
he testified before Congress and before the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]]. He
spent terms as visiting professor at MSRI in the [[University of California, Berkeley]], at
[[Churchill College, Cambridge]], at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], at Harvard, at Stanford, and at MIT. In 1990-1994 he was a managing director of fixed income research at [[Kidder, Peabody & Co.]]  He was a founding partner in 1995 of [[Ellington Capital Management]], and remains a partner.

==Research==

Geanakoplos' papers in the 1980s with [[Paul Klemperer]] and [[Jeremy Bulow]] developed the concept and invented the terminology of [[Strategic complements|Strategic Complements]] that is now commonly used in game theory, industrial organization and elsewhere.

Before the [[Late-2000s financial crisis]], Geanakoplos was known primarily for his contributions to [[General equilibrium theory]], particularly [[Incomplete markets]] in general equilibrium theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/profiles/geanak.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524010534/http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/profiles/geanak.htm |archivedate=2011-05-24 }}</ref> Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986),<ref>Geanakoplos, J.D. and H.M.

In 2009, Geanakoplos co-authored a work on credit cards and inflation through the [[Cowles Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2010/04/27/how-credit-cards-hurt-the-economy/#2fa8f40633c0|title=How Credit Cards Hurt the Economy|last=MoneyBuilder|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref> His co-author was the mathematical economist and fellow Yale professor [[Pradeep Dubey]].
