==Life in the United States==

In the spring of 1958, True moved to San Francisco, CA. She applied and was accepted to the Social Work graduate program at [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="Pioneer"/> In 1964, she graduated and began working at a psychiatric outpatient clinic in Oakland, CA. There, she met a supervisor named Mary Edwards (otherwise known as Mary Goulding), who got True involved in activist work. Initially, True focused on Japanese newcomer women who were married to American servicemen. She noticed that they "were often isolated and had trouble adjusting to the [United States]."<ref name="personal"/> Working with a Japanese social worker, she established a self-help support group for these women called the ''Himawari'' (sunflower) group. Afterward, she continued to work with other activists to create and advocate for health, mental health, and social service agencies for Asian American communities.

In 1972, True decided to return to graduate school at the [[California School of Professional Psychology]] (CSPP). She received funding from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) and was able to study psychology with a focus on minority mental health issues. During her time at CSPP, she began meeting with a group of like-minded Asian American women. In 1976, they decided to start teaching the Psychology of Asian American Women as an Asian American Studies course at UC Berkeley.<ref name="personal"/>

After finishing her graduate studies at CSPP, True joined the Region IX office of NIMH in San Francisco where she worked to help community groups and the local governments of Nevada and Arizona develop community mental health centers.<ref name="personal"/> She worked there for five years and decided to accept a position as Deputy Director at San Francisco Community Mental Health Services<ref name="NichiBei">{{cite web|url=http://www.nichibeicare.org/about-us.html|title=About Us|publisher=}}</ref> in order to continue working with local community groups.

True's career, which spans over 25 years, has been devoted to the advancement of minority affairs. True was one of the proponents of cultural and linguistic appropriate mental health services in the California bay area. In 1996, she retired from the Public Health department. For the following nine years, she trained master's level psychology students as part of the Clinical Psychology Master's Program in Tokyo, Japan.<ref name="Pioneer">{{cite web|url=http://division35section5.weebly.com/awards.html|title=Section 5 Pioneer Award|publisher=}}</ref> She currently practices psychology part-time in San Francisco, CA.

She helped organize disaster mental health assistance for the residents of San Francisco after San Francisco was hit by the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta Earthquake]] in 1989.<ref name="NichiBei"/> Later, she went to Japan to provide mental health assistance to disaster victims after the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kansai-Awaji Earthquake]] in 1995. For six months, she trained mental health professionals on disaster mental health assistance as a visiting [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Senior Scholar]] at [[Kobe University|Kobe University Medical School]].<ref name="NichiBei"/><ref name="auto"/> Similarly, she later worked with the Japanese Community and Cultural Center of Northern California (JCCCNC) to train Japanese disaster workers in San Francisco in disaster mental health assistance.<ref name="NichiBei"/> She continued with her disaster assistance work in 2011 after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tohoku Region Disaster]] when she organized mental health disaster training for a select group of workers from the affected Tohoku region.

==Research contributions==
True's research focus is on different minority groups such as the Asian American, Japanese American, and other South East Asian communities that exist within the United States. Her research includes examining privacy and confidentiality as it relates to psychotherapy. Among the focuses of the study were the procedures in place that govern how informed consent is obtained and the federal requirements for guarding confidentiality. The study also looked at third-party insurance, specifically Medicaid, and how insurance records are kept and whether or not those records are more vulnerable than other institutions with access to confidential information. The study found weak points in the safety of patient confidential information and made recommendations for professional conduct regarding confidentiality as it relates to psychotherapy as a result.<ref>Everstine, L., Everstine, D. S., Heymann, G. M., True, R. H., Frey, D. H., Johnson, H. G., & Seiden, R. H. (1980). "Privacy and confidentiality in psychotherapy". ''American Psychologist'', ''35''(9), 828.</ref>  True also contributed to an interview sample survey of adult residents of San Francisco's China Town. The researchers studied Chinese Americans' use of mental health services and discovered that although the prevalence of mental health disorders in China Town was high, only 5% of participants indicated they had utilized any [[Community mental health service|mental health services]]. The study found that this phenomenon was not caused by negative stereotypes surrounding mental illness, but rather, Chinese Americans' unawareness of the services available.<ref>Loo, C., Tong, B., & True, R.
