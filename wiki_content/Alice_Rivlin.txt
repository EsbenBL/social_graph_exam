She then went on to study at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Initially, she wanted to major in history, but after taking an economics course at [[Indiana University]], she decided to change her major to economics.<ref name=Bellinterview>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/cswep/about/awards/bell/rivlin|title=American Economic Association|website=www.aeaweb.org|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>

Rivlin earned her Bachelor of Arts in 1952, writing her senior thesis on the economic integration of [[Western Europe]], and upon graduation, she moved to Europe where she worked on the [[Marshall Plan]]. Originally, Rivlin wanted to attend graduate school in public administration but was rejected on the grounds that she was a woman of marriageable age. Rivlin earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] from [[Radcliffe College]] of [[Harvard University]] in 1958.{{R|Bellinterview}}

==Career==
Alice Rivlin was affiliated several times with the [[Brookings Institution]], including stints in 1957–1966, 1969–1975, 1983–1993, and 1999 to her death. She was a visiting professor at Georgetown University's [[McCourt School of Public Policy]]. From 1968 to 1969, she was appointed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] as Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]. In 1971 she authored ''Systematic Thinking for Social Action''. She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1973.<ref name=AAAS>{{Cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=April 7, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:FOMC 00072 (13896598810).jpg|thumb|The Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 1997. Rivlin is seated far left.]]
Rivlin was the first director of the newly established [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) during 1975–1983. She was a persistent and vociferous critic of [[Reaganomics]] as head of the CBO. In 1983, she won a [[MacArthur Foundation]] "genius" award. Under President [[Bill Clinton]] she served as the deputy director of [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) from 1993 to 1994, director of OMB from 1994 to 1996, and a governor of the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Federal Reserve]] from 1996 to 1999, during which time she served as the Fed's vice-chair. She was also chair of the [[District of Columbia Financial Control Board|District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority]] from 1998 to 2001.{{r|NYTobit}}<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/dc/control/district0911.htm Rivlin Wants to Aid Home Rule]</ref>

In 2012, she received a Foremother Award from the [[National Center for Health Research|National Research Center for Women & Families]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://center4research.org/news-events/previous-foremother-awards/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130414130432/http://center4research.org/news-events/previous-foremother-awards/ |archive-date=April 14, 2013 }}</ref>

Rivlin was on the Board of Directors at the National Institute for Civil Discourse (NICD). The institute was created at the University of Arizona after the tragic shooting of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, that killed 6 people and wounded 13 others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nicd.arizona.edu/members/alice-rivlin|title=Alice Rivlin|publisher=National Institute for Civil Discourse|access-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref>

===Debt reduction/fiscal management panels in 2010===
Rivlin and former Senator [[Pete Domenici]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[New Mexico|NM]]) were named in January 2010 to chair a Debt Reduction Task Force, sponsored by the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name='Debt Reduction'>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.heritage.org/2010/01/26/the-domenicirivlin-debt-reduction-task-force/ |title="The Domenici/Rivlin Debt Reduction Task Force" by Kathryn Nix |access-date=January 27, 2010 |date=January 26, 2010 |work=The Foundry |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |archive-date=January 27, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.heritage.org%2F2010%2F01%2F26%2Fthe-domenicirivlin-debt-reduction-task-force%2F&date=2010-01-27}}</ref>

Rivlin soon thereafter was named by President Obama to his 18-member bipartisan [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]] panel chaired by former [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Alan Simpson (American politician)|Alan K. Simpson]], (R-[[Wyoming|WY]]), and former [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Erskine Bowles]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]), commonly known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission. The balance of the panel is three more members appointed by the President, six members of the [[United States House of Representatives]], and six members of the [[United States Senate]]. The commission first met on April 27, 2010, and had a December report deadline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/04/27/getting-root-causes-our-fiscal-challenges |title=White House: Getting to the Root Causes of Our Fiscal Challenges |date=April 27, 2010 |via=[[NARA|National Archives]] |work=[[whitehouse.gov]] |access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref> A health-care component of the overall [[United States|U.S.]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[U.S. state|state]] [[United States federal budget#Solving the problem|fiscal-management challenge]] was addressed by a panel including Rivlin on [[The Diane Rehm Show]] in June.<ref>[http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2010-06-15/medicare-reimbursment-rates-and-deficit-spending "Medicare Reimbursment Rates and Deficit Spending"] with Stuart Guterman of [[Commonwealth Fund|The Commonwealth Fund]], Ron Pollack of [[Families USA]], and Brian Riedl of [[The Heritage Foundation]], ''The Diane Rehm Show'', June 15, 2010. Retrieved June 15, 2010.</ref>

Along with former Comptroller General [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]], Rivlin danced the [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]] in a video produced by The Can Kicks Back, a nonpartisan group that aims to organize [[millennials]] to pressure lawmakers to address the United States' $16.4 trillion debt.<ref name=ashton>{{Cite news|last=Ashton|first=Kevin|title=How Memes Are Orchestrated by the Man|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/how-memes-are-orchestrated-by-the-man/274466/|magazine=The Atlantic|date=28 March 2013}}</ref> The video concludes with her making an importuned plea to the twenty-somethings seated around the room: "There's no dancing around the fact that more needs to be done quickly to put our future debt on a downward track. But our leaders need to hear from you."
