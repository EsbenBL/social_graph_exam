'''Jonathan David Haidt''' ({{IPAc-en|h|aɪ|t}}; born October 19, 1963) is an American [[Social psychology|social psychologist]], Professor of Ethical Leadership at [[New York University Stern School of Business]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/jonathan-haidt|title=NYU Stern – Jonathan Haidt – Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership|first=-Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical|last=Leadership|website=www.stern.nyu.edu}}</ref> and author. His main areas of study are the [[moral psychology|psychology of morality]] and [[moral emotions]].

Haidt's main scientific contributions come from the psychological field of [[moral foundations theory]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=McNerney |first1=Samuel |title=Jonathan Haidt and the Moral Matrix: Breaking Out of Our Righteous Minds |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/jonathan-haidt-the-moral-matrix-breaking-out-of-our-righteous-minds/ |website=Scientific American |access-date=25 July 2019}}</ref> which attempts to explain the evolutionary origins of human [[moral reasoning]] on the basis of innate, gut feelings rather than logical reason.<ref>{{cite web |title=The moral matrix that influences the way people vote |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2016/nov/14/the-moral-matrix-that-influences-the-way-people-vote |website=The Guardian |access-date=25 July 2019}}</ref> The theory was later extended to explain the different moral reasoning and how they relate to political ideology, with different political orientations prioritizing different sets of morals.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winerman |first1=Lea |title=Civil discourse in an uncivil world |url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/05/cover-civil-discourse |website=American Psychological Association |access-date=25 July 2019}}</ref> The research served as a foundation for future books on various topics.

Haidt has written three books for general audiences: ''[[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom]]'' (2006) explores the relationship between ancient philosophies and modern science;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ott |first1=Jan |title=Jonathan Haidt, The Happiness Hypothesis; Putting Ancient Wisdom to the Test of Modern Science |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |date=20 February 2007 |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=297 |doi=10.1007/s10902-007-9049-2 |doi-access=free }}</ref> ''[[The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion]]'' (2012) examines how morality is shaped by emotion and intuition more than by reasoning, and why differing political groups have different notions of right and wrong;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html|title='The Righteous Mind,' by Jonathan Haidt|last=Saletan|first=William|date=2012-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-19|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and [[The Coddling of the American Mind|''The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure'']] (2018), co-written with [[Greg Lukianoff]], explores the rising political polarization and changing culture on college campuses, and its effects on mental health.

Haidt has attracted both support and criticism for his critique of the current state of universities and his interpretation of progressive values.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Henriques|first=Gregg |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201201/jonathan-haidts-moral-political-psychology|title=Jonathan Haidt's Moral-Political Psychology|website=Psychology Today|date=2012-01-01 |access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> He has been named one of the "top global thinkers" by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine, and one of the "top world thinkers" by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/11/26/the-fp-top-100-global-thinkers/|title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|last=Foreign Policy Staff|publisher=Foreign Policy|date=2012-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/world-thinkers-2013|title=World Thinkers 2013|date=2013-04-24|publisher=Prospect}}</ref> He is among the most cited researchers in political and moral psychology, and is considered among the top 25 most influential living psychologists.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 50 Most Influential Living Psychologists in the World |url=https://thebestschools.org/features/most-influential-psychologists-world/ |website=thebestschools.org |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Citations – Jonathan Haidt |url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VafYYacAAAAJ&hl=en |website=Google Scholar |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

=== Education and career ===
Haidt received a BA in [[philosophy]] from [[Yale University]] in 1985, and a PhD in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1992. He then studied [[cultural psychology]] at the [[University of Chicago]] as a [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral fellow]], supervised by [[Jonathan Baron]] and [[Alan Fiske]] (at the University of Pennsylvania), and cultural anthropologist [[Richard Shweder]] (University of Chicago). At Shweder's suggestion, he visited [[Orissa, India]], to continue his research.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/science/18mora.html |title=Is 'Do Unto Others' Written Into Our Genes? |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |date=18 September 2007 |website=New York Times |access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref> In 1995, Haidt was hired as an [[Assistant Professor|assistant professor]] at the [[University of Virginia]], where he worked until 2011, winning four awards for teaching, including a statewide award conferred by the Governor of Virginia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.schev.edu/schev/newsReleases/nr-jan2004/Gnr-012104.asp |title=Governor Warner Announces TIAA-CREF Virginia Outstanding Faculty Awards Recipients for 2004 |date=21 January 2004 |website=State Council of Higher Education for Virginia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501155929/http://www.schev.edu/schev/newsReleases/nr-jan2004/Gnr-012104.asp |archive-date=May 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>

In 1999, Haidt became active in the new field of [[positive psychology]], studying positive moral emotions. This work led to the publication of an edited volume, titled ''Flourishing'', in 2003. In 2004, Haidt began to apply moral psychology to the study of politics, doing research on the psychological foundations of [[ideology]]. This work led to the publication in 2012 of ''[[The Righteous Mind]]''. Haidt spent the 2007–2008 academic year at [[Princeton University]] as the Visiting Professor for Distinguished Teaching.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Righteous Mind: Why Good People, Particularly Intellectuals, Are Divided by Politics – An America's Founding and Future Lecture |url=https://jmp.princeton.edu/events/righteous-mind-why-good-people-particularly-intellectuals-are-divided-politics |website=jmp.princeton.edu |access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>

In 2011, Haidt moved to [[New York University Stern School of Business]] as the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership.<ref>{{cite web |title=NYU Stern – Jonathan Haidt – Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership |url=https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/jonathan-haidt |website=www.stern.nyu.edu |access-date=26 July 2019 |language=en}}</ref> In 2013, he co-founded Ethical Systems, a non-profit collaboration dedicated to making academic research on ethics widely available to businesses.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Brockman |first1=John |title=Jonathan Haidt, Biography |url=https://www.edge.org/memberbio/jonathan_haidt |magazine=Edge |access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref> In 2015, Haidt co-founded [[Heterodox Academy]], a non-profit organization that works to increase [[viewpoint diversity]], mutual understanding, and productive disagreement.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our Story|url=https://heterodoxacademy.org/our-story/|access-date=2021-07-04|website=Heterodox Academy|language=en-US}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=July 2021|certain=y}} In 2018, Haidt and Richard Reeves co-edited an illustrated edition of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'', titled ''All Minus One: John Stuart Mill’s Ideas on Free Speech Illustrated'' (illustrated by Dave Cicirelli). Haidt's current research applies moral psychology to [[business ethics]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Leadership|first=-Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical|title=NYU Stern - Jonathan Haidt - Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership|url=https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/jonathan-haidt|access-date=2021-06-18|website=www.stern.nyu.edu|language=en}}</ref>

Haidt's research on morality has led to publications and theoretical advances in four key areas.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Caldow |first1=Stephanie |title=Jonathan Haidt: The Contributions of a Moral Psychologist |url=https://positivepsychology.com/johnathan-haidt/ |website=PositivePsychology.com |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

=== Moral disgust ===
{{Main|Disgust#Morality}}
Together with [[Paul Rozin]] and [[Clark McCauley]], Haidt developed the Disgust Scale,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=16|title=Individual Differences In Sensitivity To Disgust: A Scale Sampling Seven Domains Of Disgust Elicitors|date=1994 |issue=5 |pages=7111–713 |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90212-7 |url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.mccauley.1994.individual-differences-disgust-sensitivity.pub005.pdf |access-date=15 July 2019|last1=Haidt|first1=Jonathan|last2=McCauley|first2=Clark|last3=Rozin|first3=Paul}}</ref> which has been widely used to measure individual differences in sensitivity to [[disgust]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1994-05-01|title=Individual differences in sensitivity to disgust: A scale sampling seven domains of disgust elicitors|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0191886994902127|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|language=en|volume=16|issue=5|pages=701–713|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90212-7|issn=0191-8869|last1=Haidt|first1=Jonathan|last2=McCauley|first2=Clark|last3=Rozin|first3=Paul}}</ref> Haidt, Rozin, and McCauley have written on the psychology of disgust as an emotion that began as a guardian of the mouth (against pathogens), but then expanded during biological and cultural evolution to become a guardian of the body more generally, and of the social and moral order.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Body, Psyche, and Culture: The Relationship Between Disgust and Morality |journal=Psychology & Developing Societies |date=1997 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=107–131 |doi=10.1177/097133369700900105 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238336116|last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |last2=Rozin |first2=Paul |last3=McCauley |first3=Clark |last4=Imada |first4=Sumio |s2cid=144762306 }}</ref>

=== Moral elevation ===
{{main|Elevation (emotion)}}
With Sara Algoe, Haidt argued that exposure to stories about moral beauty (the opposite of moral disgust) cause a common set of responses, including warm, loving feelings, calmness, and a desire to become a better person.<ref>Algoe, Sara B. and Jonathan Haidt. 2009. "Witnessing excellence in action: The 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration." ''[[The Journal of Positive Psychology|Journal of Positive Psychology]]'' 4:105–27.</ref> Haidt called the emotion ''moral elevation'',<ref>Haidt, Jonathan. 2003. "Elevation and the positive psychology of morality." Pp. 275–89 in ''Flourishing: Positive Psychology and the Life Well-lived'', edited by C. L. M. Keyes and J. Haidt. Washington, DC: [[American Psychological Association]].</ref> as a tribute to [[Thomas Jefferson]], who had described the emotion in detail in a letter discussing the benefits of reading great literature.<ref>Jefferson, Thomas. [1771] 1975. "Letter to Robert Skipwith." Pp. 349–51 in ''The Portable Thomas Jefferson'', edited by M. D. Peterson. New York: Penguin.</ref> Feelings of moral elevation cause increases in milk produced during lactation in breastfeeding mothers,<ref>Silvers, J., and Jonathan Haidt. 2008. "Moral elevation causes lactation." ''[[Emotion (journal)|Emotion]]'' 8:291–95.</ref> suggesting the involvement of the hormone [[oxytocin]]. There is now a large body of research on elevation and related emotions.

=== Social intuitionism ===
{{main|Social intuitionism}}
Haidt's principal line of research has been on the nature and mechanisms of moral judgment. In the 1990s, he developed the [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] model, which posits that moral judgment is mostly based on automatic processes—moral intuitions—rather than on conscious reasoning.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Liao |first1=Matthew |title=Liao S.M. (2011) Bias and Reasoning: Haidt's Theory of Moral Judgment. |date=2011 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London |isbn=978-0-230-30588-5 |pages= 108–127 |doi=10.1057/9780230305885_7 |s2cid=146369020 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/25af29aa47459732e0998491387d3c7475adb167 }}</ref> People engage in reasoning largely to find evidence to support their initial intuitions. Haidt's main paper on the social intuitionist model, "The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail", has been cited over 7,800 times.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haidt|first1=Jonathan|date=2001|title=The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment.|url=http://lifecognitionschool.ias-research.net/files/2010/06/haidt.2001.emotional-dog-rational-tail.pub022.pdf|journal=Psychological Review|volume=4|issue=108|pages=814–34|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|s2cid=2252549|s2cid-access=free}}</ref>

=== Moral foundations theory ===
{{main|Moral foundations theory}}
[[File:Haidt-political morality.png|thumb|right|A simple graphic depicting survey data from the United States intended to support moral foundations theory.]]

In 2004, Haidt began to extend the social intuitionist model to identify what he considered to be the most important categories of moral intuition.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |first2=Craig |last2=Joseph |title=Intuitive ethics: How innately prepared intuitions generate culturally variable virtues |journal=Daedalus |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=55–66 |date=2004 |doi=10.1162/0011526042365555 |jstor=20027945|s2cid=1574243 }}</ref> The resulting [[moral foundations theory]], co-developed with Craig Joseph and Jesse Graham, and based in part on the writings of [[Richard Shweder]], was intended to explain cross-cultural differences in morality. The theory posited that there are at least five innate moral foundations, upon which cultures develop their various moralities, just as there are five innate [[taste receptor]]s on the tongue, which cultures have used to create many different cuisines. The five values are:<ref name=":0" />

# ''Care/harm''
# ''Fairness/cheating''
# ''Loyalty/betrayal''
# ''Authority/subversion''
# ''Sanctity/degradation''.

Haidt and his collaborators asserted that the theory also works well to explain political differences. According to Haidt, [[Social liberalism|liberals]] tend to endorse primarily the care and fairness foundations, whereas conservatives tend to endorse all foundations more equally.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | last1=Graham | first1=Jesse | last2=Haidt | first2=Jonathan | last3=Nosek | first3=Brian A. | title=Liberals and conservatives rely on different sets of moral foundations. | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | publisher=American Psychological Association | volume=96 | issue=5 | year=2009 | issn=1939-1315 | doi=10.1037/a0015141 | pages=1029–46 |pmid=19379034| s2cid=2715121 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/36d3bc7659ef1dc4c8504b6a0cb82329b0ac39bf }}</ref> Later, in ''[[The Righteous Mind]]'', a sixth foundation, ''Liberty/oppression'', was presented.

== Non-academic works ==
Haidt has authored the following non-academic books for general audiences, related to various subjects in psychology and politics.

=== ''The Happiness Hypothesis'' ===
{{main|The Happiness Hypothesis}}
''The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom'' (2006) draws on ancient philosophical ideas in light of contemporary scientific research to extract potential lessons and how they may apply to everyday life.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flint |first1=James |title=Don't worry, be happy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/22/shopping.philosophy1 |website=The Guardian |access-date=18 July 2019}}</ref> The book poses "ten Great Ideas" on happiness espoused by philosophers and thinkers of the past — [[Plato]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]], and others — and then considers what modern scientific research has to say regarding these ideas.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Christine |title=Book Review: The Happiness Hypothesis |url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/book_review_the_happiness_hypothesis |website=Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley |access-date=18 July 2019}}</ref>

=== ''The Righteous Mind'' ===
{{main|The Righteous Mind}}
''The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion'' (2012) draws on Haidt's previous research on [[Moral Foundations Theory|moral foundations theory]]. It argues that moral judgments arise not from logical reason, but from gut feelings, asserting that liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have different intuitions about right and wrong because they prioritize different values.

=== ''The Coddling of the American Mind'' ===
{{main|The Coddling of the American Mind}}
''The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure'' (2018), co-written with [[Greg Lukianoff]], expands on an essay the authors wrote for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roth |first1=Michael |title=Have parents made their kids too fragile for the rough-and-tumble of life? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/have-parents-made-their-kids-too-fragile-for-the-rough-and-tumble-of-life/2018/09/07/7b977440-8e92-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html |website=The Washington Post |access-date=18 July 2019}}</ref> The book explores the rising political polarization and changing culture on college campuses and its effects on mental health. It also explores changes in childhood, including the rise of "fearful parenting," the decline of unsupervised play, and the effects of social media in the last decade.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Singal |first1=Jesse |title=How 'Coddled' Are American College Students, Anyway? |url=http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind-and-the-culture-wars.html |website=New York Magazine |access-date=18 July 2019}}</ref>

==="The Elephant and the Rider"===

One widely cited metaphor throughout Haidt's books is that of the elephant and the rider. His observations of [[social intuitionism]], the notion that intuitions come first and rationalization second, led to the metaphor described in his work.<ref>{{cite web |last=McNerney |first=Samuel |title=Jonathan Haidt and the Moral Matrix: Breaking Out of Our Righteous Minds |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/12/08/jonathan-haidt-the-moral-matrix-breaking-out-of-our-righteous-minds/ |publisher=Scientific American (blogs) |access-date=February 2, 2013}}</ref> The rider represents consciously controlled processes, and the elephant represents automatic processes. The metaphor corresponds to Systems 1 and 2 described in [[Daniel Kahneman]]'s [[Thinking, Fast and Slow#Two systems|''Thinking, Fast and Slow'']].<ref>{{cite news |last=Haidt |first=Jonathan |title=Reasons Matter (When Intuitions Don't Object) |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/reasons-matter-when-intuitions-dont-object/|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 2, 2013|date=October 7, 2012}}</ref> This metaphor is used extensively in both ''The Happiness Hypothesis'' and ''The Righteous Mind''.

==Political views==
Haidt describes how he began to study political psychology in order to help the Democratic Party win more elections, and argues that each of the major political groups—conservatives, progressives, and libertarians—have valuable insights and that truth and good policy emerge from the contest of ideas.<ref name="Righteous Mind Book">{{cite book |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |title=The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion |url=https://archive.org/details/righteousmindwhy0000haid |url-access=registration |date=2012 |publisher=Pantheon Books |isbn=978-0307455772}}</ref> Since 2012, Haidt has referred to himself as a [[Centrism|political centrist]].<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=955920434792419328|user=JonHaidt|title=huh?

Haidt is involved with several efforts to help bridge the political divide and reduce [[political polarization in the United States]]. In 2007, he founded the website ''CivilPolitics.org'', a clearinghouse for research on political civility.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Saletan |first1=William |title='The Righteous Mind,' by Jonathan Haidt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=26 July 2019 |date=23 March 2012}}</ref> He serves on the advisory boards of [[Represent.Us]]., a non-partisan anti-corruption organization; the [[Acumen Fund]], which invests in companies, leaders, and ideas that are changing the way the world tackles poverty; and ''braverangels.org'', a bipartisan group working to reduce political polarization.

In 2019, Haidt argued that there is a "very good chance American democracy will fail, that in the next 30 years we will have a catastrophic failure of our democracy."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/americas-uncivil-war-on-democracy/news-story/45a86ac9b438b85dce0bbbd289e1604e|title=America's Uncivil War on Democracy|author=Kelly, Paul|website=TheAustralian.com|publisher=[[The Australian]]|access-date=20 July 2019}} Access by subscription only (February 2021).</ref>

== Reception ==
While himself an atheist, Haidt has argued that religion contains psychological wisdom that can promote human flourishing, and that the [[New Atheists]] have themselves succumbed to moralistic [[dogma]]. These contentions elicited a variety of responses in a 2007 online debate sponsored by the website ''[[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge]]''. [[PZ Myers]] praised the first part of Haidt's essay while disagreeing with his criticism of the New Atheists; [[Sam Harris]] criticized Haidt for his perceived obfuscation of harms caused by religion; [[Michael Shermer]] praised Haidt; and biologist [[David Sloan Wilson]] joined Haidt in criticizing the New Atheists for dismissing the notion that religion is an evolutionary adaptation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/moral-psychology-and-the-misunderstanding-of-religion |title=Moral Psychology and the Misunderstanding of Religion |last=Haidt |first=Jonathan |date=21 September 2007 |website=Edge.org |access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>

In 2020, [[Peter Wehner]] wrote in ''[[The Atlantic]],'' "Over the past decade, no one has added more to my understanding of how we think about, discuss, and debate politics and religion than Jonathan Haidt." He added that, "In his own field, in his own way, Jonathan Haidt is trying to heal our divisions and temper some of the hate, to increase our wisdom and understanding, and to urge us to show a bit more compassion toward one another."<ref name="wehner-atlantic">{{cite news |last1=Wehner |first1=Peter |author-link1=Peter Wehner |title=Jonathan Haidt Is Trying to Heal America's Divisions |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/jonathan-haidt-pandemic-and-americas-polarization/612025/ |access-date=3 June 2020 |agency=The Atlantic |date=24 May 2020}}</ref>
