== Academic research ==
Karlan's research focuses on the areas of [[development economics]], [[behavioral economics]] and [[international development]] policy.

In microfinance, Karlan has studied the following topics:  interest rate policy, credit evaluation and scoring policies, entrepreneurship training, group versus individual liability, savings product design, credit with education, and impact from increased access to credit and savings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Does microlending really help the poor? |publisher=[[BBC World Service]] |work=[[Business Daily]] |date=2009-07-09 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/business/2009/07/090729_microfinance_biz_daily.shtml |accessdate=2013-12-17}}</ref> His work on savings and health typically uses insights from psychology and behavioral economics to design and test specialized products.<ref name=CGD>{{cite web |url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/expert/detail/11761/ |title=Dean Karlan, Non-Resident Fellow |publisher=[[Center for Global Development]]}}</ref>
