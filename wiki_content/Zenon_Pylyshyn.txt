'''Zenon Walter Pylyshyn'''<ref name="sheehy_Bio"/> {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɛ|n|ən|_|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|ʃ|ən}}; born 25 August 1937, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada) is a [[Canadian]] [[cognitive scientist]] and [[philosopher]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100356193|title=Zenon Walter Pylyshyn - Oxford Reference|website=www.oxfordreference.com|doi=}}</ref>

He holds degrees in [[engineering]]-[[physics]] (BEng 1959) from [[McGill University]] and in [[control systems]] (MSc 1960) and [[experimental psychology]] (PhD 1963), both from the Regina Campus, [[University of Saskatchewan]].  His dissertation was on the application of [[information theory]] to studies of human [[short-term memory]].  He was a [[Canada Council]] Senior fellow from 1963&ndash;1964.

==Academic career==
Pylyshyn was professor of [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] at the [[University of Western Ontario]] in [[London, Ontario|London]] from 1964 until 1994, where he also held honorary positions in philosophy and [[electrical engineering]] and was director of the UWO Center for Cognitive Science. In 1994 he accepted positions as the Board of Governors Professor of Cognitive Science and as the director of the new [[Rutgers University]] Center for Cognitive Science in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]].

==Current research==
Pylyshyn' research has generally involved the theoretical analysis of the nature of the human cognitive systems behind perception, imagination, and reasoning.  He has also continued to develop his [[visual indexing theory]] (sometimes called the [[FINST theory]]) which hypothesizes a preconceptual mechanism responsible for individuating, tracking, and directly (or demonstratively) referring to the visual properties encoded by cognitive processes.

==Awards and honors==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2013}}
In 1990, the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] awarded him the [[Donald O. Hebb]] Award for "distinguished contributions to psychology as a science."  He holds fellowships in the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]], the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] at [[Stanford University]], the [[MIT]] Center for Cognitive Science, the [[Canadian Institute for Advanced Research]], the [[Canadian Psychological Association]], and was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 1998. He was invited to give the [[Jean Nicod Prize|Jean Nicod lectures]] in [[Paris]] in 2004. He has presided over both the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]], and the [[Cognitive Science Society]]. From 1985 to 1994 he directed the Program in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.
