=== Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Intelligence ===

Barbey’s research investigates the effects of human [[brain damage]] on   intellectual  and [[Social neuroscience|social]] functions, with particular emphasis on the [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref name="Noonan"/><ref name="Anthes"/> 

Studies of patients with [[frontal lobe damage]] have a long history in the [[Neuroscience and intelligence|neuroscience of intelligence]] and provide a direct way to test whether regions in the [[prefrontal cortex]] are necessary for specific intellectual abilities. However, it was only recently that the limited applicability and specificity of small sample studies of focal brain damage were overcome by contemporary lesion mapping approaches.<ref name="Bates">{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Wilson|first2=Stephen M.|last3=Saygin|first3=Ayse Pinar|last4=Dick|first4=Frederic|last5=Sereno|first5=Martin I.|last6=Knight|first6=Robert T.|last7=Dronkers|first7=Nina F.|title=Voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=6|issue=5|pages=448–450|doi=10.1038/nn1050|pmid=12704393|year=2003|s2cid=5134480}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Glascher|first1=J.|last2=Rudrauf|first2=D.|last3=Colom|first3=R.|last4=Paul|first4=L.

In a series of studies,<ref name="Anthes"/> 
Barbey's research group investigated almost 200 patients with [[Focal and diffuse brain injury|focal brain injuries]] and mapped the architecture of [[Executive functions|executive]], [[Social neuroscience|social]], and [[Affective neuroscience|emotional]] brain systems.

=== Network Neuroscience Theory of Human Intelligence === 

Barbey has proposed a Network Neuroscience Theory of Human Intelligence that emphasizes brain plasticity, in which "general intelligence reflects individual differences in the efficiency and flexibility of brain networks"<ref name="Taulbee"/> and "the capacity to integrate information across the brain as a whole".<ref name="Taulbee"/> According to this view, "crystallized intelligence" involves the ability to rapidly access existing representations of knowledge and experience while "fluid intelligence" involves the ability to solve novel problems in ways that are adaptive and flexible.<ref name="Taulbee"/><ref name="Williams">{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Shawna |title=The Biological Roots of Intelligence Imaging, behavioral, and genetic data yield clues to what's behind effective thinking |journal=The Scientist |date=November 1, 2018 |url=https://www.the-scientist.com/features/the-biological-roots-of-intelligence-64931 |accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>
