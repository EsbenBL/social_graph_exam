====Reviews====
*"Arun Agrawal (in ''Environmentality'') provides a most lucid account of the people-government- forest interplay in the 20th century Kumaon Himalayas in this book.... Arun Agrawal addresses these fascinating questions on the basis, not only of archival research, but significantly, on the strength of extensive long-term fieldwork."—The Hindu<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2006/12/12/stories/2006121200751600.htm|title=Modernity and Nature|last=Gadgil|first=Madhav|date=December 12, 2006|work=The Hindu|access-date=16 July 2012}}</ref>
*"This book (''Environmentality'') aims to promote Arun Agrawal's own neologism - "environmentality" ... This book, too, has hidden its worthwhile arguments in thickets of verbal profusion, which make it hard to see the teak for the forest."--The Times Higher Education<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=205082&sectioncode=34|title=If only we could see the teak for the trees|last=Chapman|first=Graham|date=September 1, 2006|work=The Times Higher Education|access-date=16 July 2012}}</ref>
