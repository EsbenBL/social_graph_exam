[[Bruce G. Blair]] writes, "Scott Sagan's book [The Limits of Safety] is nothing less than a tour de force.... It is by far the most carefully researched and painstaking study of nuclear weapons safety ever written."<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691021015/ Book review at Amazon], same source counts that 100 books cite this book</ref><ref>{{cite journal

He also is one of the leading pessimist scholars about [[nuclear proliferation]], and his co-authored book with [[Kenneth Waltz]], ''The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed'',<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-0393977479|title=The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed|first1=Scott Douglas|last1=Sagan|first2=Kenneth N.|last2=Waltz|date=28 August 2002|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|via=Amazon|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadofnuclearw00saga_0}}</ref> is widely read and cited in the literature on nuclear weapons. Sagan writes in the book, "the United States and the Soviet Union survived the [[cold war]] and did not use their massive nuclear-weapons arsenals during the period's repeated crises. This should be a cause of celebration and wonder; it should not be an excuse for inaction with either [[arms control]] or [[non-proliferation]] policies."
