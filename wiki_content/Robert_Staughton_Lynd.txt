'''Robert Staughton Lynd''' (September 26, 1892 – November 1, 1970) was an [[United States|American]] [[sociologist]] and professor at [[Columbia University]], [[New York City]]. He is best known for conducting the first [[Middletown studies]] of [[Muncie, Indiana]], with his wife, [[Helen Lynd]]; as the coauthor of ''Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture'' (1929) and ''Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts'' (1937); and a pioneer in the use of [[social research|social surveys]]. He was also the author of ''Knowledge for What? The Place of the Social Sciences in American Culture'' (1939). In addition to writing and research, Lynd taught at Columbia from 1931 to 1960. He also served on U.S government committees and advisory boards, including [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]]'s Research Committee on Social Trends and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Consumers' Advisory Board of the [[National Recovery Administration]]. Lynd was also a member of several scientific societies.

==Early life and education==
Robert Staughton Lynd was born in [[New Albany, Indiana]], on September 26, 1892, 
to Staughton and Cornelia Day Lynd. Robert Lynd received a [[bachelor of arts]] degree from [[Princeton University]] 1914.<ref name=NYTObit-Robt/><ref name=LOC-RobertLynd>"Biographical Notes" in {{cite book | author=Manuscript Division Staff | title =Robert Staughton Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd Papers| publisher =[[Library of Congress]] | year =2014 | location =[[Washington, D.C.]] | url = http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms010315|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref> In the years 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1933 he attended classes at the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]].

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1914 Lynd began working as an assistant editor at ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' in New York City, before leaving in 1918 to serve in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Field Artillery during [[World War I]].<ref name=LOC-RobertLynd/><ref name=Hoover3>Hoover, p. 3.</ref><ref name=GS216>Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 216.</ref> After the war Lynd was an advertising and publicity manager at [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] for about a year, then began work in 1920 as an assistant publisher for B. W. Huebsch, Inc. and joined the staff of the ''Freeman''.<ref name=LOC-RobertLynd/>

In 1921 Lynd was a divinity student at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]], and for a summer he work as a church missionary in [[Elk Basin]], [[Wyoming]], the site of several oil camps.<ref name=Hoover3/> Afterwards Lynd wrote "Done in Oil," an exposé critical of the conditions in the camps. The essay and his community work brought Lynd to the attention of the Rockefeller family. ([[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] tried unsuccessfully to block publication of the essay, but held no grudge against Lynd for writing it.) In 1923 Rockefeller agreed to let the Institute of Social and Religious Research hire Lynd as a director for its Small City Study. Lynd served as the director of the Institute's study, which Rockefeller funded, from 1923 to 1926. Lynd's wife, Helen, joined the project that became better known as the [[Middletown studies]] as a coinvestigator.<ref name=Hoover4/><ref name=GS216/><ref>{{cite web|title=Staughton Lynd Interview|work=The First Measured Century|publisher=[[PBS]]| url = https://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/lynd.htm| access-date = 2018-05-21}}</ref>

===First Middletown study===
In 1924 Robert and Helen Lynd moved to [[Muncie, Indiana]], to begin an eighteen-month study of daily life in this [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] community. The Lynds and their three-person staff primarily observed the social lives of the city's inhabitants. The study compared life in Muncie in 1890 to Muncie in 1924, with the goal of measuring the effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]] on American life. The Lynds coauthored ''Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture'' (1929) describing the details of their research in Muncie.<ref>{{cite web| title =Robert and Helen Lynd | work =The First Measured Century | publisher =PBS | url =http://www.pbs.org/fmc/timeline/plynds.htm | access-date =May 22, 2018}}</ref><ref name=MiddletownStudies>{{cite web|title=Middletown Studies Collection and Digital Archives |publisher=Ball State University |archive-date=2007-01-29| url=http://www.bsu.edu/library/article/0%2C%2C29036--%2C00.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129015103/http://www.bsu.edu/library/article/0%2C%2C29036--%2C00.html| url-status=dead|access-date=2018-05-21}} (archived version)</ref> It was the first sociological study of an American community and a classic work in the field.<ref name=NYT-HelenObit/>

''Middletown'' was an immediate success, receiving positive reviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', and launched the academic career of both Robert and Helen Lynd.<ref name=GS217-18>Gugin and St. Clair, pp. 217–18.</ref><ref name=Hoover7>Hoover, p. 7.</ref> Reviewers "praised its careful research and its scientific character," but the book's popularity was due to the coauthors' explanations of American life. Not all the reviews were positive. The book was strongly criticized for its failure to include a variety of racial and ethnic experiences. Instead, the Lynds focused on the city's white and predominantly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] community.<ref name="GS217-18"/><ref>Muncie's population at the time of the Middletown study in 1925 was ninety-two percent native-born whites. See Hoover, p. 5.</ref>

===Researcher and professor===
In 1926 Lynd became assistant director of the Division of Educational Research at the Commonwealth Fund, then joined the [[Social Science Research Council]] in 1927 as a research supervisor and assistant to the chairman. He spent another four years, 1928 to 1931, as the Council's secretary.<ref name=LOC-RobertLynd/><ref name=Hoover10>Hoover, p. 10.</ref>

In 1931 Lynd accepted a tenure-track position as Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, a position he held until 1960. While teaching at Columbia, Lynd began but never completed sociological studies concerning the impact that the [[Great Depression]] had on segments of the population in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and in [[Montclair, New Jersey]].<ref name = "FBI 01"/><ref name=Hoover10/>

Lynd returned to Muncie, Indiana, during the summer of 1935 to make additional observations of the city and to update earlier research. After returning to New York, Robert and Helen Lynd coauthored ''Middletown in Transition'' (1937). The sequel to their earlier work was more theoretical and not as popular among readers as ''Middletown''. The sequel concluded that the community's values and attitudes had not changed much since their earlier research. The tone of the second book was also more critical than the first. Although the Lynds considered a third volume on Middletown, their plans were never realized.<ref name=GS218/><ref>Hoover, p. 12.</ref>

After the publication of two books on the Middletown studies, Lynd resumed his academic career as a social scientist and professor at Columbia University. He also resumed writing, which included ''Knowledge for What? The Place of Social Science in American Culture'' (1939).<ref name=LOC-RobertLynd/><ref name=GS218/>

In addition to teaching at the university, Lynd served on U.S government committees and advisory boards, including [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]]'s Research Committee on Social Trends and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Consumers' Advisory Board of the [[National Recovery Administration]]. Lynd became a member of the advisory board's executive committee in 1935.<ref name=Hoover10/> He was also a member of a number of scientific societies in the field of sociological anthropology and economics, such as the AAAS, the American Social Society, American Statistics Society, and American Economics Association.<ref name = "FBI 01"/>

==Potential Communist affiliations==
During the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Robert and Helen Lynd were the subjects of U.S. government investigations for alleged involvement in the [[Communist party]]. Several individuals who were interviewed in 1942 in connection with Robert Lynd's initial case believed that his political views were "extremely liberal," but they did not believe that he was a party member.<ref name=GS218/>

==Later years==
Lynd continued to write in his later years, including two published essays, "Power in the United States" (1956), and "Power in American Society as Resource and Problem" (1957).<ref name=Hoover16>Hoover, p. 16.</ref> He retired from teaching at Columbia University in 1960.<ref name=NYTObit-Robt/>

==Death and legacy==
Lynd died at [[Warren, Connecticut]], on November 1, 1970, at the age of seventy-eight.<ref name=NYTObit-Robt/>

Robert and [[Helen Lynd]] are best known for their research and descriptions of small-town life during the groundbreaking "[[Middletown studies]] of [[Muncie, Indiana]], the first systematical, sociological study of a community in the United States.<ref name=LOC-RobertLynd/><ref name=NYT-HelenObit/><ref>Irving Louis Horowitz, "Robert S. and Helen Merrell Lynd," in {{cite book|author=David L.

Both book became classics of American [[sociology]].<ref name=NYT-HelenObit/><ref name=Center>{{cite web|title=About the Center|publisher=Center for Middletown Studies, Ball State University |url=http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/centersandinstitutes/middletown/about | access-date =2018-05-21}}</ref>

The Lynds' pioneering sociological work began a legacy of continued studies of Muncie, including the establishment of the Center for Middletown Studies in 1980. (The Center became affiliated with [[Ball State University]] in 1984.) Beginning with [[Frederick Lewis Allen]] in the 1930s, scholars have followed the Lynds' efforts, producing "hundreds of books, articles, and films examining life in one small city in Indiana" with the hope that their studies provide a "better understanding of modern American life."<ref name=GS218/><ref>Hoover, pp. 17–23.</ref> Subsequent Middletown studies resulted in the publication of additional books, most notably  ''Middletown Families'' (1982) and ''All Faithful People'' (1983). Other studies were filmed: the six-part documentary, ''Middletown'', that aired on [[PBS]] in 1982, and ''The First Measured Century'', first broadcast on PBS in 2000.<ref name=Center/><ref>Hoover, pp. 26–27; 36–38.</ref> A seventh part of ''Middletown'', "Seventeen" (1982), was judged too controversial to broadcast, as it focused on the world of high school seniors, portraying changing mores, language and sexuality. It was later released on the independent circuit and widely praised.<ref>[http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2011aprjun/middletown.html ''Middletown: Seventeen''], Harvard Film Archive, 2018</ref>

== Lynd's thought==
''In Knowledge for What?'' , he argues that American culture holds outstanding and contradictory assumptions such as women being both "the finest of God's creatures" while also considered inferior to men in term of reasoning power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.222468|title=Knowledge For What|last=Robert S Lynd|date=1948|pages=59–62}}</ref>
