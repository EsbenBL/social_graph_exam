Shugart |publisher=University of California, Davis |date=June 2019 |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref> He continued to study political science at the University of California, Irvine, obtaining an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in 1985 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1988.<ref name=profile/>

In 1989, Shugart became a professor in the Department of Political Science and School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at The [[University of California, San Diego]].<ref name=profile/> In 2013, he moved to The University of California, Davis.<ref name=profile/> In June 2016, Shugart became an Affiliated Professor at the University of Haifa, and in 2018 he was made a Distinguished Professor at The University of California, Davis.<ref name=profile/> He has held temporary or visiting positions at several universities in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Israel.<ref name=profile/>

==Research==
In addition to peer-reviewed journal articles and chapters in edited volumes, Shugart has been an author or editor of numerous books. His first book, coauthored with [[Rein Taagepera]], was ''Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems'', published in 1989. The book is an empirical study of electoral systems and electoral rules, which determine how votes cast in an election are converted into seats in a legislature.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sven |last=Berg |title=Review Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems |journal=European Journal of Political Economy |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=148–149 |date=1990 |doi=10.1016/0176-2680(90)90044-J}}</ref> One of the central variables that Taagepera and Shugart study is [[Electoral district#District magnitude|electoral district magnitude]] and its effects; they demonstrate that in [[Plurality voting|plurality voting systems]] a larger district magnitude means a less proportional legislature, whereas in [[Proportional representation|proportional voting systems]] a larger district magnitude means a more proportional legislature.<ref name=irvine>{{cite journal |first=William P. |last=Irvine |title=Review Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems |journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=875–876 |date=1 December 1989 |doi=10.1017/S0008423900020485}}</ref> They study this proportionality by developing a notion of the discrepancy between the proportionality of the system and perfect proportionality, noting that no electoral system can be perfectly proportional.<ref name=irvine/> ''Seats and votes'' presents comparisons between specific cases, including detailed discussions of [[New Zealand]], [[Finland]], and [[Japan]], as well as general principles, such as the observation that the number of members in the [[lower house]] of a legislature tends to resemble the cube root of the total population.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael C. |last=Munger |title=Review Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=676–677 |date=June 1990 |doi=10.2307/1963580}}</ref> ''Seats and Votes'' has been identified as one of the first systematic empirical studies of electoral systems, building on earlier work by [[Maurice Duverger]], [[Douglas W. Rae]], and [[Arend Lijphart]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Donley T. |last=Studlar |title=Review Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems |journal=Comparative Political Studies |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=283 |date=1 July 1992}}</ref> In 2017, Shugart and Taagepera coauthored a second book, ''Votes from Seats: Logical Models of Electoral Systems''. In ''Votes from Seats'', Shugart and Taagepera again study of the relationship between electoral systems and party systems, this time presenting four power laws which use the size of a country's assembly and the magnitude of its districts to predict core features of its party system.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael D. |last=McDonald |title=Review Votes from Seats: Logical Models of Electoral Systems |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=849–851 |date=September 2018 |doi=10.1017/S1537592718001226}}</ref>

In 1992, Shugart and John M. Carey published the book ''Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics''. ''Presidents and Assemblies'' is a large-scale study of presidential and parliamentary government types, as well as the plethora of hybrid regimes that combine features of each.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Gerhard |last=Loewenberg |title=Review Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics |journal=The Journal of Politics |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=305–307 |date=1 February 1994 |doi=10.2307/2132376}}</ref> James L. Sundquist wrote that ''Presidents and Assemblies'' is "an encyclopedic, yet concise, compilation of the major structural variations in governments all over the world".<ref>{{cite journal |first=James L. |last=Sundquist |title=Review Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=197 |date=1 January 1993}}</ref> Shugart and Carey evaluate the stability of presidential and parliamentary systems, in light of the argument by analysts of the [[Waves of democracy#Third wave|third wave of democratization]] like [[Juan Linz]] that presidential systems are inherently less stable than parliamentary systems; to the contrary, Shugart and Carey show that presidential systems have not broken down more often than parliamentary systems.<ref name=geddes>{{cite journal |first=Barbara |last=Geddes |title=Review Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=244–245 |date=March 1994 |doi=10.2307/2944925}}</ref> Related to their focus on hybrid regimes, Shugart and Carey study the variation that exists within presidential regime types, and the relationship between these institutional decisions and the fragmentation of the country's party system as well as the potential for conflict between its executive and legislature.<ref name=geddes/> Translations of chapters from ''Presidents and Assemblies'' have been published in languages including Italian, Russian, Polish, and Portuguese.<ref name=profile/> Shugart and his coauthor [[David Samuels (political scientist)|David J. Samuels]] also examined executive-legislative relations in detail in their 2010 book ''Presidents, Parties, and Prime Ministers: How the Separation of Powers Affects Party Organization and Behavior'', in which they further studied the effects of institutional rules on competition between parties.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jorge Miguel |last=Fernandes |title=Review Presidents, Parties, and Prime Ministers: How the Separation of Powers Affects Party Organization and Behavior |journal=West European Politics |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=1134–1135 |date=1 September 2011 |doi=10.1080/01402382.2011.591110}}</ref>

In addition to authoring books, Shugart has edited several volumes: ''Presidentialism and Democracy in Latin America'' (2017, with Scott Mainwaring), ''Mixed-Member Electoral Systems: The Best of Both Worlds?'' (2001, with [[Martin Wattenberg (political scientist)|Martin P. Wattenberg]]), and ''The Oxford Handbook of Electoral Systems'' (2018, with Erik Herron and Robert Pekkanen).<ref name=profile/> He was also an author of the 2014 book ''A Different Democracy: A Systematic Comparison of the American System with Thirty Other Democracies'' with Steven L. Taylor, Arend Lijphart, and [[Bernard Grofman]].

Shugart has twice received the George H. Hallett Award, which is given by the Representation and Electoral Systems Section of the [[American Political Science Association]] to "the author of a book published at least ten years ago that has made a lasting contribution to the literature on representation and electoral systems".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/2019-apsa-organized-section-awards/0AB2943B3604C9CAD07DB2B194BC3B4C/core-reader |title=APSA section awards |publisher=American Political Science Association |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref> In 1999, Shugart and Rein Taagepera were given the Hallett Award for their 1989 book ''Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems''.<ref name=hallett1>{{cite web |url=http://jcolomer.blogspot.com/2008/09/fair-representation-ideal-of.html |title=George H.
