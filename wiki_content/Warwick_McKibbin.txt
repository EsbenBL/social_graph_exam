==Collaborations==
The [[McKibbin-Sachs Global Model]] is a global economic model developed originally in 1984 jointly with [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and is a widely used intertemporal general equilibrium model of the world economy.<ref>McKibbin W.J. and J. Sachs (1991) Global Linkages: Macroeconomic Interdependence and Co-operation in the World Economy, Brookings Institution, June, 277 pages ({{ISBN|0-8157-5600-3}})</ref>

The [[G-Cubed Model]] is a global economic model developed in 1991 jointly with [[Peter Wilcoxen]] and is a widely used multi-sector intertemporal general equilibrium model of the world economy.<ref>McKibbin W. and P. Wilcoxen (1999) "The Theoretical and Empirical Structure of the G-Cubed Model" Economic Modelling, 16, 1, pp 123-148 ({{ISSN|0264-9993}})</ref>

The Henderson McKibbin Taylor Rule for Monetary Policy was first proposed by [[Dale W. Henderson]] and Warwick McKibbin in 1993<ref>Henderson D.W. and W. McKibbin (1993) "A Comparison of Some Basic Monetary Policy Regimes for Open Economies: Implications of Different Degrees of Instrument Adjustment and Wage Persistence"''Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy'', 39, pp 221-318.</ref> and simultaneously by John B. Taylor.<ref>Taylor, John B. (1993) "Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice," ''Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy'', 39, pp.</ref>

The [[McKibbin-Wilcoxen Blueprint also known as the McKibbin Wilcoxen Hybrid]]. McKibbin (Australian National University) and [[Peter Wilcoxen]] (Syracuse University) outline various approaches to climate change policy.<ref>McKibbin W.J and P.J. Wilcoxen (2002) Climate Change Policy after Kyoto: A Blueprint for a Realistic Approach, Brookings Institution, December, 133 pages ({{ISBN|0-8157-0608-1}})</ref> They argue that the issue of taking action against [[Global warming|climate change]] should be separated from the issue of whether Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Once the Kyoto Protocol is set aside it is clear that there are better options available. One such approach is the [[McKibbin-Wilcoxen Blueprint]] which is outlined in this article.

They argue that [[Kyoto Protocol]]-based [[carbon trading|carbon-trading]] systems are too inflexible/brittle to attract developing countries (particularly China & India). A better system would need to be flexible enough to refine outcomes over time (as new data become available).

==Honours and awards==
McKibbin was awarded the Order of Australia in 2016 "For Distinguished Service to Education as an Economist, Particularly in the Area of Global Climate Policy, and to Financial Institutions and International Organisations" and the Centenary medal in 2003 "For Service to Australian Society through Economic Policy and Tertiary Education".
