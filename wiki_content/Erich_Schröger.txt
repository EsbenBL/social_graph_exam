==Biography==

Erich Schröger<ref>http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~biocog/schroger/</ref> studied [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[Munich School of Philosophy]] and at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University]] (LMU) in Munich. In 1982, he earned a Baccalaureat in Philosophy, in 1986 he earned a Diploma in Psychology, and in 1991 he was awarded a PhD from the LMU for his work on [[Subjective constancy|loudness constancy]].<ref>Schröger, E. (1991). Konstanz und Lautheit. Zur Wirkung von Entfernung und Einstellung auf die Lautstärkebeurteilung. Göttingen: Hogrefe.</ref> After research stays at the Cognitive Brain Research unit of the [[University of Helsinki]] (Finland) and a stint of teaching at the [[Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt]] (Germany), Schröger achieved his Habilitation in psychology in 1996 at LMU.

In 1997, Schröger was appointed to the [[University of Leipzig]] as a professor of [[Biological Psychology]]. Since 2001 he has held its Chair of [[Cognitive Psychology|Cognitive]]<ref>Schröger, E., & Koelsch, S. (Hrsg.). (2013).

Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag.</ref> and has been the Head of the research group BioCog.<ref>http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~biocog/</ref> In 2017, Schröger became Vice Rector for Research and Young Academics.<ref>https://home.uni-leipzig.de/biocog/content/de/mitarbeiter/schroger/schroger-cv-en/</ref>

From 1999 to 2002, Schröger served as Vice-Dean of the Faculty for Biological Sciences, Pharmacy, and Psychology at the University of Leipzig. From 2014 to 2016, he was Dean of the Faculty. Schröger's other service roles at the university include: from 2002 to 2004, Director of the Institute for General Psychology; from 2003 to 2004, Head of the Psychological Institutes; in 2005 and from 2010 to 2013, Dean for Study Affairs in Psychology.

As of October 2019, Schröger had published more than 300 scientific papers, book chapters, and books<ref>BioCog (2018). Erich Schröger publications.

==Grants==

Schröger has received more than 15 grants from [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Council]] (DFG),<ref>http://home.uni-leipzig.de/biocog/content/uploads/DFG_gepris_Schröger.pdf</ref> more than five grants from the [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]],<ref>http://home.uni-leipzig.de/biocog/content/uploads/DAAD_Projekte_seit_2009.pdf</ref> and several EU-projects.

In December 2008, Schröger won a one-million-Euro, five-year [[Reinhart Koselleck]] Project Grant by the DFG.<ref>https://www.dfg.de/service/presse/pressemitteilungen/2008/pressemitteilung_nr_70/index.html</ref> The main research issue of this project was the mechanism of predictive modeling in audition. Specifically, Schröger investigated how automatic predictions about upcoming auditory events can be generated on the basis of regular environmental stimulation.<ref>Bendixen, A., SanMiguel, I., & Schröger, E. (2012). Early electrophysiological indicators for predictive processing in audition: A review.

The human brain maintains contradictory and redundant auditory sensory predictions. PLoS One, 8, e53634.</ref> Due to this mechanism, for example, incoming acoustic stimuli can be processed with astonishing speed as when comprehending spoken language or localizing moving sounds. Likewise, the specific processing of self-induced auditory stimuli—stimuli that a person creates by means of its own behavior—can be explained by the principles of predictive modeling.<ref>Timm, J., SanMiguel, I., Saupe, K., & Schröger, E. (2013). The N1-suppression effect for self-initiated sounds is independent of attention. BMC Neuroscience, 14(1), 2.</ref> In order to optimize a predictive model, the information processing system calculates predictive errors as the difference between the prediction and the actual stimulus signal.<ref>SanMiguel, I., Widmann, A., Bendixen, A., Trujillo-Barreto, N., & Schröger, E.
