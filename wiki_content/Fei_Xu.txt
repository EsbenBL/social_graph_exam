'''Fei Xu''' ({{Lang-zh|s=徐绯|p=Xú Fēi}}; born 1969) is an American [[developmental psychologist]] and [[cognitive scientist]] who is currently a professor of psychology and the director of the Berkeley Early Learning Lab at [[UC Berkeley]]. Her research focuses on cognitive and language development, from infancy to middle childhood.<ref name="Guggenheim–2018" />

==Early life==
Xu was born and raised in [[Beijing]], China, where she graduated from the [[High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China]].<ref name=FeiXuBELL>{{Cite web |title=Fei Xu |url=https://www.babylab.berkeley.edu/feixu |website=Berkeley Early Learning Lab |access-date=March 15, 2021}}</ref> She moved to the U.S. and attended [[Smith College]], graduating in 1991 with a B.A. in [[Cognitive Science]].<ref name=FeiXuBELL /> She earned her Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from [[M.I.T.]] in 1995.<ref name=FeiXuBELL />

==Career==
Xu began her career as a [[postdoctoral fellow]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Rutgers University]], and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] under [[Alan Leslie|Alan M.

==Research==
Xu worked with several prominent developmental and cognitive psychologists early in her career.  She worked with [[Susan Carey]] for her Ph.D. research on object individuation, [[sortal]] concepts, and [[Vocabulary development#Early word learning|early word learning]].<ref name=Xu1995>{{Cite book |title=Criteria of Object Individual and Numerical Identity in Infants and Adults: The Object-first Hypothesis |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11135 |publisher=[[MIT]] |date=1995 |access-date=March 16, 2021 |last=Xu |first=Fei|hdl=1721.1/11135 }}</ref> She worked with [[Elizabeth Spelke]] as a postdoctoral fellow, focusing on prelinguistic infants’ representation of numbers.<ref name=FeiXuBELL /><ref name=XuSpelke2000110>{{Cite journal |title=Large number discrimination in 6-month-old infants |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027799000669 |doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(99)00066-9 |journal=[[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] |date=January 10, 2000 |access-date=March 18, 2021 |last1=Xu |first1=Fei |last2=Spelke |first2=Elizabeth S. |author-link2=Elizabeth Spelke |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=B1–B11|pmid=10594312 |s2cid=12185314 }}</ref>  She also worked with [[Alan Leslie]] at [[Rutgers University]] on infants’ object concept.<ref name=LeslieXu19980101>{{Cite journal |title=Indexing and the object concept: developing 'what' and 'where' systems |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661397011133 |journal=[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] |date=January 1, 1998 |access-date=March 18, 2021 |last1=Leslie |first1=Alan M. |author-link1=Alan Leslie |last2=Xu |first2=Fei |last3=Tremoulet |first3=Patrice D. |last4=Scholl |first4=Brian J. |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(97)01113-3 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=10–18|pmid=21244957 |s2cid=8612552 }}</ref>

Beginning in the 2010s, Xu advocated for a new approach to the study of cognitive development, namely rational constructivism.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Towards a rational constructivist approach to cognitive development |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPpcv72MlLw |via=[[YouTube]] |date=March 31, 2014 |access-date=March 18, 2021 |publisher=[[UCLA]] Center for Behavior, Evolution, and Culture |last=Xu |first=Fei |type=Video }}</ref><ref name=Xu2016 /> She argued that human infants begin life with a set of proto-conceptual primitives such as object, number, and agent, and as young learners acquire language. These initial representations are transformed into a format that is compatible with language and propositional thought.<ref name=FeydikXu2019 /> She suggested that three types of learning mechanisms explain both belief revision and genuine conceptual change: (1) Language and symbol learning; (2) Bayesian inductive learning; and (3) Constructive thinking.<ref name=FeydikXu2019 />  She also suggests that infants and young children are active learners, and cognitive agency is part and parcel of development.<ref name=FeydikXu2019 /> In addition, she has explored the implications of rational constructivism for philosophy of mind and [[epistemology]].<ref name=FedykXu20171127 />
