== History ==
[[File:Baker library.jpg|thumb|Baker Library]]
The school was established in 1908.<ref name="businessinsiderfeloni25mostsuccessful">{{cite news |last1=Baer |first1=Drake |last2=Feloni |first2=Richard |date=September 18, 2014 |title=The 25 Most Successful Harvard Business School Graduates |work=Business Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/famous-harvard-business-school-alumni-2014-9?IR=T |access-date=July 6, 2016}}</ref> Initially established by the [[humanities]] faculty, it received independent status in 1910, and became a separate administrative unit in 1913. The first dean was historian [[Edwin Francis Gay]] (1867–1946).<ref name="obiteconomichistoryreview">{{cite journal |last=Gras |first=N. S. B. |year=1946 |title=Obituary Notice: Edwin Francis Gay |journal=The Economic History Review |jstor=2590582 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1946.tb00722.x |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=60–62}}</ref> Yogev (2001) explains the original concept:
:This school of business and public administration was originally conceived as a school for diplomacy and government service on the model of the French ''[[Sciences Po|Ecole des Sciences Politiques]].''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Andreas |year=2018 |title=A school is "a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside": Toward the reinvention of the business school |journal=Business Horizons |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=599–608 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 }}</ref> The goal was an institution of higher learning that would offer a Master of Arts degree in the humanities field, with a major in business. In discussions about the curriculum, the suggestion was made to concentrate on specific business topics such as banking, railroads, and so on... Professor Lowell said the school would train qualified public administrators whom the government would have no choice but to employ, thereby building a better public administration... Harvard was blazing a new trail by educating young people for a career in business, just as its medical school trained doctors and its law faculty trained lawyers.<ref>Esther Yogev, "Corporate Hand in Academic Glove: The New Management's Struggle for Academic Recognition—The Case of the Harvard Group in the 1920s," ''American Studies International'' (2001) 39#1 pp. 52–71 online</ref>

The business school pioneered the development of the [[case method]] of teaching, drawing inspiration from this approach to legal education at Harvard. Cases are typically descriptions of real events in organizations. Students are positioned as managers and are presented with problems which they need to analyze and provide recommendations on.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bridgman |first1=Todd |last2=Cummings |first2=Stephen |last3=McLaughlin |first3=Colm |year=2016 |title=Restating the Case: How Revisiting the Development of the Case Method Can Help Us Think Differently About the Future of the Business School |journal=Academy of Management Learning & Education |doi=10.5465/amle.2015.0291 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=724–741 |url=https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Restating_the_case_How_revisiting_the_development_of_the_case_method_can_help_us_think_differently_about_the_future_of_the_business_school/12735965 }}</ref>

From the start the school enjoyed a close relationship with the corporate world. Within a few years of its founding many business leaders were its alumni and were hiring other alumni for starting positions in their firms.<ref>Yogev, "Corporate Hand in Academic Glove: The New Management's Struggle for Academic Recognition—The Case of the Harvard Group in the 1920s"</ref><ref>Melvin T.

Smith, ''The American Business System: The Theory and Practice of Social Science, the Case of the Harvard Business School, 1920–1945'' (Garland Publishers, 1986)</ref>

At its founding, the school accepted only male students. The [[Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration|Training Course in Personnel Administration]], founded at [[Radcliffe College]] in 1937, was the beginning of business training for women at Harvard. HBS took over administration of that program from Radcliffe in 1954. In 1959, alumnae of the one-year program (by then known as the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration) were permitted to apply to join the HBS MBA program as second-years. In December 1962, the faculty voted to allow women to enter the MBA program directly. The first women to apply directly to the MBA program matriculated in September 1963.<ref name=BuildingFoundation>{{cite web |title=Building the Foundation: Business Education for Women at Harvard University: 1937–1970 |website=Harvard Business School |url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/wbe/index.html |access-date=3 November 2015}}</ref>

In 2012–2013, HBS administration implemented new programs and practices to improve the experience of female students and recruit more female professors.<ref name="nytimeskantorhbscasestudygender">{{cite news |last=Kantor |first=Jodi |date=September 7, 2013 |title=Harvard Business School Case Study: Gender Equity |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/education/harvard-case-study-gender-equity.html?pagewanted=all&mcubz=1 |access-date=September 11, 2017}}</ref>
