<!--Overview of discipline:-->'''Psychology''' is the [[science]] of [[mind]] and [[behavior]]. Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, including [[feeling]]s and [[thought]]s. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social science|social sciences]]. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to [[neuroscience]]. As a social science, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.<ref name="Fernald">Fernald LD (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7p-J4-SWuQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Psychology: Six perspectives''] (pp.12–15). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.</ref><ref name="Psychology">Hockenbury & Hockenbury. Psychology. Worth Publishers, 2010.</ref> '''Ψ''' (or [[Psi (Greek)|''psi'']]) is a [[Greek letter]] which is commonly associated with the science of psychology.

A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a [[psychologist]]. Some psychologists can also be classified as social, [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]], or [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]]. Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and [[social behavior]]. Others explore the [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[neurobiology|biological]] processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.

<!--Subjects and methods:-->Psychologists are involved in research on [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|subjective experiences]], [[motivation]], [[Human brain#Functions|brain functioning]], and [[personality psychology|personality]]. Psychologists' interests extend to [[interpersonal relationship]]s, [[psychological resilience]], [[family resilience]], and other areas within [[social psychology]]. They also consider the unconscious mind.<ref name ="reference_name_A">[[Psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]] are most typically associated with theories about the unconscious mind. By contrast, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]]. [[cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.</ref> Research psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. Some, but not all, [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[counseling psychology|counseling]] psychologists rely on [[Hermeneutics#Psychology|symbolic interpretation]].

<!--Application and scope:-->While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society.<ref name="O'Neil">O'Neil, H.F.; cited in Coon, D.; Mitterer, J.O. (2008).

== Etymology and definitions ==
The word ''[[wikt:psychology|psychology]]'' derives from the Greek word [[Psyche (psychology)|''psyche'']], for spirit or [[soul (spirit)|soul]]. The latter part of the word "psychology" derives from -λογία [[wikt:-logia|''-logia'']], which refers to "study" or "research".<ref name="OED">Online Etymology Dictionary. (2001). [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=psychology "Psychology"].</ref> The [[Latin]] word ''psychologia'' was first used by the [[Croatia]]n [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Croatian latinistic literature|Latinist]] [[Marko Marulić]] in his book, ''[[Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae]]'' (''Psychology, on the Nature of the Human Soul'') in the late 15th century or early 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Krstic/marulic.htm |title=Classics in the History of Psychology – Marko Marulic – The Author of the Term "Psychology" |publisher=Psychclassics.yorku.ca |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref> The earliest known reference to the word ''psychology'' in English was by [[Steven Blankaart]] in 1694 in ''The Physical Dictionary''. The dictionary refers to "Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul."<ref name="OED Psychology">(Steven Blankaart, p. 13) as quoted in "psychology n."

In 1890, [[William James]] defined ''psychology'' as "the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions."<ref>James, W. (1890). ''The Principles of Psychology''. New York: Henry Holt.</ref> This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as [[John B.

== History ==
{{Main|History of psychology}}
The ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology. In Ancient Egypt the [[Ebers papyrus|Ebers Papyrus]] mentioned [[clinical depression|depression]] and thought disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Okasha |first1=Ahmed  |date=2005 |title=Mental Health in Egypt |journal=The Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=116–25 |pmid=16342608  }}</ref> Historians note that Greek philosophers, including [[Thales]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]] (especially in his ''[[On the Soul|De Anima]]'' treatise),<ref>"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ Aristotle's Psychology]".

In China, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of [[Laozi]] and [[Confucius]], and later from the doctrines of [[Buddhism]]. This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe in term of a division of physical reality and mental reality as well as the interaction between the physical and the mental. Chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin–yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.<ref name=HsuehGuo>Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, "China", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>

Influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Indian philosophy]] explored distinctions in types of awareness. A central idea of the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and other [[Vedic period|Vedic]] texts that formed the foundations of Hinduism was the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their [[Ātman (Hinduism)|eternal, unchanging soul]]. Divergent Hindu doctrines and [[Buddhism]] have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. [[Yoga]] encompasses a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. [[Theosophy]], a religion established by [[Russian Americans|Russian-American]] philosopher [[Helena Blavatsky]], drew inspiration from these doctrines during her time in [[British Raj|British India]].<ref name=Paranjpe>Anand C. Paranjpe, "From Tradition through Colonialism to Globalization: Reflections on the History of Psychology in India", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref><ref name=ptraju>PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, pages 35-36</ref>

Psychology was of interest to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment thinkers]] in Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum. He suggested that the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia Empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia Rationalis'' in 1734. [[Immanuel Kant]] advanced the idea of [[anthropology]] as a discipline, with psychology an important subdivision. Kant, however, explicitly rejected the idea of an [[experimental psychology]], writing that "the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object." In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>Schwarz, K. A., & Pfister, R. (2016). Scientific psychology in the 18th century: A historical rediscovery. ''Perspectives on Psychological Science, 11'', 399-407. {{doi|10.1177/1745691616635601}}</ref> At the end of the Napoleonic era, Prussian authorities discontinued the Old University of Münster.<ref>Schwarz, K.

However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation.<ref name=Horst>Horst U.K. Gundlach, "Germany", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref> In England, early psychology involved [[phrenology]] and the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, and the country's crowded "lunatic" asylums.<ref>Alan Collins, "England", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>

=== Beginning of experimental psychology ===
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]

[[Gustav Fechner]] began conducting [[psychophysics]] research in [[Leipzig]] in the 1830s. He articulated the principle that human perception of a stimulus varies [[logarithmically]] according to its intensity.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), p. 61.</ref> The principle became known as the [[Weber–Fechner law]]. Fechner's 1860 ''Elements of Psychophysics'' challenged Kant's negative view with regard to conducting quantitative research on the mind.<ref>Fechner, G. T. (1860). Elemente der Psychophysik. Breitkopf u. Härtel. (Elements of Psychophysics)</ref><ref name=Horst /> Fechner's achievement was to show that "mental processes could not only be given numerical magnitudes, but also that these could be measured by experimental methods."<ref name=Horst/> In Heidelberg, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, where he established the psychological [[laboratory]] that brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of materials.<ref name="WundtStanford">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-wundt/ "Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt"].</ref> [[Paul Flechsig]] and [[Emil Kraepelin]] soon created another influential laboratory at Leipzig, a  psychology-related lab, that focused more on experimental psychiatry.<ref name=Horst />

The German psychologist [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], a researcher at the [[University of Berlin]], was another 19th-century contributor to the field. He pioneered the experimental study of memory and developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting.<ref>Wozniak, R.H. (1999). Introduction to memory: Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885/1913). [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/wozniak.htm Classics in the history of psychology]</ref> In the early twentieth century, [[Wolfgang Kohler]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Kurt Koffka]] co-founded the school of [[Gestalt psychology]] (not to be confused with the [[Gestalt therapy]] of [[Fritz Perls]]). The approach of Gestalt psychology is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes. Rather than [[Reductionism|reducing]] thoughts and behavior into smaller component elements, as in structuralism, the Gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important, and differs from the sum of its parts.

Psychologists in Germany, Denmark, Austria, England, and the United States soon followed Wundt in setting up laboratories.<ref name=BenjaminBaker /> [[G. Stanley Hall]], an American who studied with Wundt, founded a psychology lab that became internationally influential. The lab was located at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Hall, in turn, trained [[Yūjirō Motora|Yujiro Motora]], who brought experimental psychology, emphasizing psychophysics, to the [[Imperial University of Tokyo]].<ref name=Takasuna>Miki Takasuna, "Japan", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref> Wundt's assistant, [[Hugo Münsterberg]], taught psychology at Harvard to students such as [[Narendra Nath Sen Gupta]]—who, in 1905, founded a psychology department and laboratory at the [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name=Paranjpe /> Wundt's students [[Walter Dill Scott]], [[Lightner Witmer]], and [[James McKeen Cattell]] worked on developing tests of mental ability. Cattell, who also studied with [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Francis Galton]], went on to found the [[Psychological Corporation]]. Witmer focused on the mental testing of children; Scott, on employee selection.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), p. 60.</ref>

Another student of Wundt, the Englishman [[Edward Titchener]], created the psychology program at [[Cornell University]] and advanced "[[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]]" psychology. The idea behind structuralism was to analyze and classify different aspects of the mind, primarily through the method of [[introspection]].<ref name=Goodwin /> William James, [[John Dewey]], and [[Harvey Carr]] advanced the idea of [[Functional psychology|functionalism]], an expansive approach to psychology that underlined the Darwinian idea of a behavior's usefulness to the individual. In 1890, James wrote an influential book, ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', which expanded on the structuralism. He memorably described "[[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]." James's ideas interested many American students in the emerging discipline.<ref name=Goodwin /><ref>''The Principles of Psychology'' (1890), with introduction by George A. Miller, Harvard University Press, 1983 paperback, {{ISBN|0-674-70625-0}} (combined edition, 1328 pages)</ref><ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), pp. 178–182.</ref> Dewey integrated psychology with societal concerns, most notably by promoting [[progressive education]], inculcating moral values in children, and assimilating immigrants.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), pp. 196–200.</ref>

[[File:One of Pavlov's dogs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|One of the dogs used in Pavlov's experiment with a surgically implanted [[cannula]] to measure [[saliva]]tion, [[taxidermy|preserved]] in the Pavlov Museum in [[Ryazan]], Russia]]

A different strain of experimentalism, with a greater connection to physiology, emerged in South America, under the leadership of Horacio G. Piñero at the [[University of Buenos Aires]].<ref>Cecilia Taiana, "Transatlantic Migration of the Disciplines of Mind: Examination of the Reception of Wundt's and Freud's Theories in Argentina", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref> In Russia, too, researchers placed greater emphasis on the biological basis for psychology, beginning with [[Ivan Sechenov]]'s 1873 essay, "Who Is to Develop Psychology and How?" Sechenov advanced the idea of brain [[reflexes]] and aggressively promoted a [[determinism|deterministic]] view of human behavior.<ref name=SirotkinaSmith>Irina Sirotkina and Roger Smith, "Russian Federation", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref> The Russian-Soviet [[physiologist]] [[Ivan Pavlov]] discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed "[[classical conditioning]]" and applied the process to human beings.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Windholz |first=G. |year=1997 |title=Ivan P.

=== Consolidation and funding ===
One of the earliest psychology societies was ''La Société de Psychologie Physiologique'' in France, which lasted from 1885 to 1893. The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology sponsored by the [[International Union of Psychological Science]] took place in Paris, in August 1889, amidst [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|the World's Fair]] celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. William James was one of three Americans among the 400 attendees. The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) was founded soon after, in 1892. The International Congress continued to be held at different locations in Europe and with wide international participation. The Sixth Congress, held in Geneva in 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese, as well as [[Esperanto]]. After a hiatus for World War I, the Seventh Congress met in Oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans. In 1929, the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the APA.<ref name=BenjaminBaker>Ludy T. Benjamin, Jr., and David B. Baker, "The Internationalization of Psychology: A History", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref> Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing new psychology to the East. New ideas about psychology diffused from Japan into China.<ref name=HsuehGuo /><ref name=Takasuna />

American psychology gained status upon the U.S.'s entry into World War I. A standing committee headed by [[Robert Yerkes]] administered mental tests ("[[Army Alpha]]" and "[[Army Beta]]") to almost 1.8 million soldiers.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> Subsequently, the [[Rockefeller family]], via the [[Social Science Research Council]], began to provide funding for behavioral research.<ref>Franz Samuelson, "Organizing for the Kingdom of Behavior: Academic Battles and the Organizational Policies in the Twenties"; ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'' 21, January 1985.</ref><ref>Hans Pols, "The World as Laboratory: Strategies of Field Research Developed by Mental Hygiene Psychologists in Toronto, 1920–1940" in Theresa Richardson & Donald Fisher (eds.), ''The Development of the Social Sciences in the United States and Canada: The Role of Philanthropy''; Stamford, CT: Ablex Publishing, 1999; {{ISBN|1-56750-405-1}}</ref> Rockefeller charities funded the National Committee on Mental Hygiene, which disseminated the concept of mental illness and lobbied for applying ideas from psychology to child rearing.<ref name=Tomes2008 /><ref>Sol Cohen, "The Mental Hygiene Movement, the Development of Personality and the School: The Medicalization of American Education"; ''History of Education Quarterly'' 23.2, Summer 1983.</ref> Through the Bureau of Social Hygiene and later funding of [[Alfred Kinsey]], Rockefeller foundations helped establish research on sexuality in the U.S.<ref>Vern L. Bullough, "The Rockefellers and Sex Research"; ''Journal of Sex Research'' 21.2, May 1985. "Their importance is hard to overestimate. In fact, in the period between 1914 and 1954, the Rockefellers were almost the sole support of sex research in the United States. The decisions made by their scientific advisers about the nature of the research to be supported and how it was conducted, as well as the topics eligible for research support, shaped the whole field of sex research and, in many ways, still continue to support it."</ref> Under the influence of the Carnegie-funded [[Eugenics Record Office]], the Draper-funded [[Pioneer Fund]], and other institutions, the [[Eugenics in the United States|eugenics movement]] also influenced American psychology. In the 1910s and 1920s, eugenics became a standard topic in psychology classes.<ref name=GuthrieChapter4>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 4: "Psychology and Race" (pp. 88–110). "Psychology courses often became the vehicles for eugenics propaganda. One graduate of the Record Office training program wrote, 'I hope to serve the cause by infiltrating eugenics into the minds of teachers. It may interest you to know that each student who takes psychology here works up his family history and plots his family tree.' Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Wisconsin, and Northwestern were among the leading academic institutions teaching eugenics in psychology courses."</ref> In contrast to the US, in the UK psychology was met with antagonism by the scientific and medical establishments, and up until 1939, there were only six psychology chairs in universities in England.<ref>Michell, J, (1999) [https://books.google.it/books?id=oNIcvjpDQeQC&pg=PA143 ''Measurement in Psychology: A Critical History of a Methodological Concept''], p.143</ref>

During World War II and the Cold War, the U.S. military and intelligence agencies established themselves as leading funders of psychology by way of the armed forces and in the new [[Office of Strategic Services]] intelligence agency. University of Michigan psychologist Dorwin Cartwright reported that university researchers began large-scale propaganda research in 1939–1941. He observed that "the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week-by-week-propaganda policy for the United States Government." Cartwright also wrote that psychologists had significant roles in managing the domestic economy.<ref>Dorwin Cartwright, "Social Psychology in the United States During the Second World War", ''Human Relations'' 1.3, June 1948, p. 340; quoted in Cina, "Social Science For Whom?" (1981), p. 269.</ref> The Army rolled out its new [[Army General Classification Test|General Classification Test]] to assess the ability of millions of soldiers. The Army also engaged in large-scale psychological research of [[Samuel A. Stouffer#Studies in Social Psychology in World War II: The American Soldier|troop morale and mental health]].<ref name = "Schonfeld">Schonfeld, I.S., & Chang, C.-H. (2017). ''Occupational health psychology: Work, stress, and health''. New York, NY: Springer Publishing Company.</ref> In the 1950s, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[Ford Foundation]] collaborated with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to fund research on [[psychological warfare]].<ref>Catherine Lutz, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=hwVWpV6jBzoC&pg=PA245 Epistemology of the Bunker: The Brainwashed and Other New Subjects of Permanent War]", in Joel Pfister & Nancy Schnog (eds.), ''Inventing the Psychological: Toward a Cultural History of Emotional Life in America''; Yale University Press, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06809-3}}</ref> In 1965, public controversy called attention to the Army's [[Project Camelot]], the "Manhattan Project" of social science, an effort which enlisted psychologists and anthropologists to analyze the plans and policies of foreign countries for strategic purposes.<ref>Cina, "Social Science For Whom?"

"Had it come to fruition, CAMELOT would have been the largest, and certainly the most generously funded, behavioral research project in U.S. history. With a $4–6 million contract over a period of 3 years, it was considered, and often called, a veritable Manhattan Project for the behavioral sciences, at least by many of the intellectuals whose services were in heavy demand."</ref>

In Germany after World War I, psychology held institutional power through the military and subsequently expanded along with the rest of the military under the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=Horst /> Under the direction of [[Hermann Göring]]'s cousin [[Matthias Göring]], the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]] was renamed the Göring Institute. [[Freudian psychoanalysis|Freudian psychoanalysts]] were expelled and persecuted under the anti-Jewish policies of the [[Nazi Party]], and all psychologists had to distance themselves from [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]], founders of [[psychoanalysis]] who were also Jewish.<ref>Cocks, ''Psychotherapy in the Third Reich'' (1997), pp. 75–77.</ref> The Göring Institute was well-financed throughout the war with a mandate to create a "New German Psychotherapy." This psychotherapy aimed to align suitable Germans with the overall goals of the Reich. As described by one physician, "Despite the importance of analysis, spiritual guidance and the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental problems and to subordinate them to the requirements of the ''[[Volk]]'' and the ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|Gemeinschaft]]''." Psychologists were to provide ''Seelenführung'' [lit., soul guidance], the leadership of the mind, to integrate people into the new vision of a German community.<ref>Cocks, ''Psychotherapy in the Third Reich'' (1997), p. 93.</ref> [[Harald Schultz-Hencke]] melded psychology with the Nazi theory of biology and racial origins, criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed.<ref>Cocks, ''Psychotherapy in the Third Reich'' (1997), pp. 86–87. "For Schultz-Hencke in this 1934 essay, life goals were determined by ideology, not by science. In the case of psychotherapy, he defined health in terms of blood, strong will, proficiency, discipline, (''Zucht und Ordnung''), community, heroic bearing, and physical fitness. Schultz-Hencke also took the opportunity in 1934 to criticize psychoanalysis for providing an unfortunate tendency toward the exculpation of the criminal."</ref> [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]], a German psychologist recognized for developing the technique of [[autogenic training]], prominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable, and devised techniques for facilitating this process.<ref>Jürgen Brunner, Matthias Schrempf, & Florian Steger, "[http://doctorsonly.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2008_4_5.pdf Johannes Heinrich Schultz and National Socialism]", ''Israel Journal of Psychiatry & Related Sciences'' 45.4, 2008. "Bringing these people to a right and deep understanding of every German's duty in the New Germany, such as preparatory mental aid and psychotherapy in general and in particular for persons to be sterilized, and for people having been sterilized, is a great, important and rewarding medical duty."</ref>

After the war, new institutions were created although some psychologists, because of their Nazi affiliation, were discredited. [[Alexander Mitscherlich (psychologist)|Alexander Mitscherlich]] founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called ''Psyche''. With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Mitscherlich established the first clinical psychosomatic medicine division at Heidelberg University. In 1970, psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students.<ref>Cocks, ''Psychotherapy in the Third Reich'' (1997), Chapter 14: "Reconstruction and Repression", pp. 351–375.</ref>

After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks]] promoted psychology as a way to engineer the "New Man" of socialism. Consequently, university psychology departments trained large numbers of students in psychology. At the completion of training, positions were made available for those students at schools, workplaces, cultural institutions, and in the military. The Russian state emphasized [[Pedology (children study)|pedology]] and the study of child development. [[Lev Vygotsky]] became prominent in the field of child development.<ref name=SirotkinaSmith /> The Bolsheviks also promoted [[free love]] and embraced the doctrine of psychoanalysis as an antidote to sexual repression.<ref name=Kozulin1984Pages84to86>Kozulin, ''Psychology in Utopia'' (1984), pp. 84–86. "Against such a background it is not at all surprising that psychoanalysis, as a theory that ventured to approach the forbidden but topical theme of sexual relations, was embraced by the newborn Soviet psychology. Psychoanalysis also attracted the interest of Soviet psychology as a materialist trend that had challenged the credentials of classical introspective psychology. The reluctance of the pre-Revolutionary establishment to propagate psychoanalysis also played a positive role in the post-Revolutionary years; it was a field uncompromised by ties to old-regime science." Though c.f.

"Stalin's purges of the 1930s did not spare Soviet psychologists. Leading Marxist philosophers earlier associated with psychology—including Yuri Frankfurt, Nikolai Karev, and Ivan Luppol—were executed in prison camps. The same fate awaited Alexei Gastev and Isaak Shipilrein. Those who survived lived in an atmosphere of total suspicion. [...] People who dominated their fields yesterday might be denounced today as traitors and enemies of the people, and by tomorrow their names might disappear from all public records. Books and newspapers were constantly being recalled from libraries to rid them of 'obsolete' names and references."</ref> Following World War II, Jewish psychologists past and present, including [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Alexander Luria|A.R. Luria]], and Aron Zalkind, were denounced; Ivan Pavlov (posthumously) and Stalin himself were celebrated as heroes of Soviet psychology.<ref>Kozulin, ''Psychology in Utopia'' (1984), pp. 25–26, 48–49.</ref> Soviet academics experienced a degree of liberalization during the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. The topics of cybernetics, linguistics, and genetics became acceptable again. The new field of [[engineering psychology]] emerged. The field involved the study of the mental aspects of complex jobs (such as pilot and cosmonaut). Interdisciplinary studies became popular and scholars such as [[Georgy Shchedrovitsky]] developed systems theory approaches to human behavior.<ref>Kozulin, ''Psychology in Utopia'' (1984), pp. 27–33. "Georgy Schedrovitsky, who is currently at the Moscow Institute of Psychology, can be singled out as the most prominent theorist working in the context of systems research. [...] This is Schedrovitsky's second major thesis: Activity should not be regarded as an attribute of the individual but rather as an all-embracing system that 'captures' individuals and 'forces' them to behave a certain way. This approach may be traced back to the assertion of Wilhelm Humboldt that it is not man who has language as an attribute, but rather language that 'possesses' man. [...] Schedrovitsky's activity approach has been applied successfully to the design of man-machine syst,ms and to the evaluation of human factors in urban planning."</ref>

Twentieth-century Chinese psychology originally modeled itself on U.S. psychology, with translations from American authors like William James, the establishment of university psychology departments and journals, and the establishment of groups including the Chinese Association of Psychological Testing (1930) and the [[Chinese Psychological Society]] (1937). Chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and language learning. Chinese psychologists were drawn to the idea that education would enable modernization. John Dewey, who lectured to Chinese audiences between 1919 and 1921, had a significant influence on psychology in China. Chancellor [[Cai Yuanpei|T'sai Yuan-p'ei]] introduced him at [[Peking University]] as a greater thinker than Confucius. [[Zing-Yang Kuo|Kuo Zing-yang]] who received a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, became President of [[Zhejiang University]] and popularized [[behaviorism]].<ref>Chin & Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 5–9.</ref> After the [[Chinese Communist Party]] gained control of the country, the Stalinist Soviet Union became the major influence, with [[Marxism–Leninism]] the leading social doctrine and Pavlovian conditioning the approved means of behavior change. Chinese psychologists elaborated on Lenin's model of a "reflective" consciousness, envisioning an "active consciousness" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|p=tzu-chueh neng-tung-li}}) able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle. They developed a concept of "recognition" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|p=jen-shih}}) which referred to the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview; failure to correspond with party doctrine was "incorrect recognition."<ref>Chin & Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 9–17. "The Soviet psychology that Peking modeled itself upon was Marxist-Leninist psychology with a philosophical base in dialectical materialism and a newly added label, Pavlovianism. This new Soviet psychology leaned heavily on Lenin's theory of reflection, which was unearthed in his two volumes posthumously published in 1924. Toward the late twenties, a group of Soviet research psychologists headed by Vygotskii, along with Luria and Leont'ev, laid the groundwork for a Marxist-Leninist approach to psychic development."</ref> Psychology education was centralized under the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], supervised by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. In 1951, the Academy created a Psychology Research Office, which in 1956 became the Institute of Psychology. Because most leading psychologists were educated in the United States, the first concern of the Academy was the re-education of these psychologists in the Soviet doctrines. Child psychology and pedagogy for the purpose of a nationally cohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline.<ref>Chin & Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 18–24.</ref>

Several associations including the [[Association of Black Psychologists]] and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non-European racial groups in the profession.<ref name=PickrenFowler />

The [[International Union of Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS) is the world federation of national psychological societies.

=== Boundaries ===

Early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from [[parapsychology]], which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed popularity (including the interest of scholars such as William James). Some people considered parapsychology to be part of "psychology." Parapsychology, hypnotism, and [[Psychic|psychism]] were major topics at the early International Congresses. But students of these fields were eventually ostractized, and more or less banished from the Congress in 1900–1905.<ref name=BenjaminBaker /> Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University in Japan, with publications such as ''Clairvoyance and Thoughtography'' by Tomokichi Fukurai, but it was mostly shunned by 1913.<ref name=Takasuna />

As a discipline, psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a "soft" science. Philosopher of science [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 critique implied psychology overall was in a pre-paradigm state, lacking agreement on the type of overarching theory found in mature sciences such as chemistry and physics.<ref>T.S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 1st. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1962.</ref> Because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and questionnaires, critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science. Skeptics have suggested that personality, thinking, and emotion cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective self-reports, which may be problematic. Experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities.<ref name="Beveridge_subj">{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/pb.26.3.101 |title=Time to abandon the subjective–objective divide? |journal=Psychiatric Bulletin |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=101–103 |year=2002 |last1=Beveridge |first1=Allan |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Peterson_subj">Peterson, C.

Divisions still exist within the field, with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans, which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population. Critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a "cult of empiricism," which limits the scope of research because investigators restrict themselves to methods derived from the physical sciences.<ref>Teo, ''The Critique of Psychology'' (2005), pp. 36–37. "Methodologism means that the method dominates the problem, problems are chosen in subordination to the respected method, and psychology has to adopt without question, the methods of the natural sciences. [...] From an epistemological and ontological-critical as well as from a human-scientific perspective the experiment in psychology has limited value (for example, only for basic psychological processes), given the nature of the psychological subject matter, and the reality of persons and their capabilities."</ref> Feminist critiques have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of (historically) mostly male researchers.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> Jean Grimshaw, for example, argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a [[patriarchal]] agenda through its efforts to control behavior.<ref>Teo, ''The Critique of Psychology'' (2005), p. 120. "Pervasive in feminist critiques of science, with the exception of feminist empiricism, is the rejection of positivist assumptions, including the assumption of value-neutrality or that research can only be objective if subjectivity and emotional dimensions are excluded, when in fact culture, personality, and institutions play significant roles (see Longino, 1990; Longino & Doell, 1983). For psychology, Grimshaw (1986) discussed behaviorism's goals of modification, suggesting that behaviorist principles reinforced a hierarchical position between controller and controlled and that behaviorism was in principle an antidemocratic program."</ref>

Psychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling, and therefore an important area of study. Behaviorial neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, involves the application of biological principles to the study of physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other animals. The allied field of [[comparative psychology]] is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals.<ref>Michela Gallagher & Randy J. Nelson, "Volume Preface", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 3: ''Biological Psychology''.</ref> A leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are [[Functional specialization (brain)|localized in the brain]]. From [[Phineas Gage]] to [[Henry Molaison|H.M.]] and [[Clive Wearing]], individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this area.<ref name=ThompsonZola>Richard F. Thompson & Stuart M. Zola, "Biological Psychology", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 1: ''History of Psychology''.</ref> Modern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France [[Paul Broca]] traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function. Soon after, [[Carl Wernicke]] identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech.<ref>Luria, "The Working Brain" (1973), pp. 20–22.</ref>

The contemporary field of [[behavioral neuroscience]] focuses on the physical basis of behavior. Behaviorial neuroscientists use animal models, often relying on rats, to study the neural, genetic, and cellular mechanisms that underlie behaviors involved in learning, memory, and fear responses.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pinel |first=John |title=Biopsychology |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-205-83256-9}}</ref> [[Cognitive neuroscience|Cognitive neuroscientists]], by using neural imaging tools, investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans. [[neuropsychology|Neuropsychologists]] conduct psychological assessments to determine how an individual's behavior and cognition are related to the brain.

[[Evolutionary psychology]] approaches thought and behavior from a modern evolutionary perspective. This perspective suggests that psychological adaptations evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. Evolutionary psychologists attempt to find out how human psychological traits are evolved adaptations, the results of natural selection or sexual selection over the course of human evolution.<ref name="Behavior Genetics">{{Cite book |vauthors= McGue M, Gottesman II | date= 2015| chapter= Behavior Genetics |journal= The Encyclopedia of Clinical Psychology | doi= 10.1002/9781118625392.wbecp578 | pages=1–11| isbn= 978-1-118-62539-2}}</ref>

The history of the biological foundations of psychology includes evidence of racism. The idea of white supremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by Europeans.<ref>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 1: "'The Noble Savage' and Science" (pp. 3–33)</ref> [[Carl von Linnaeus]]'s four-fold classification of humans classifies Europeans as intelligent and severe, Americans as contented and free, Asians as ritualistic, and Africans as lazy and capricious. Race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as ''[[drapetomania]]'' and ''[[dysaesthesia aethiopica]]''—the behavior of uncooperative African slaves.<ref>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 5: "The Psychology of Survival and Education" (pp. 113–134)</ref> After the creation of experimental psychology, "ethnical psychology" emerged as a subdiscipline, based on the assumption that studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans.<ref>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 2: "Brass Instruments and Dark Skins" (pp. 34–54)</ref>

A tenet of behavioral research is that a large part of both human and lower-animal behavior is learned. A principle associated with behavioral research is that the mechanisms involved in learning apply to humans and non-human animals. Behavioral researchers have developed a treatment known as [[behavior modification]], which is used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with desirable ones.

[[File:Little Albert experiment (1920).webm|250px|thumb|thumbtime=192|The film of the Little Albert experiment]]Early behavioral researchers studied stimulus–response pairings, now known as [[classical conditioning]]. They demonstrated that when a biologically potent stimulus (e.g., food that elicits salivation) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g., a bell) over several learning trials, the neutral stimulus by itself can come to elicit the response the biologically potent stimulus elicits. Ivan Pavlov—known best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previously linked with food—became a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans.<ref name=SirotkinaSmith /> In the United States, [[Edward Lee Thorndike]] initiated "[[connectionism|connectionist]]" studies by trapping animals in "puzzle boxes" and rewarding them for escaping.

Starting in the 1950s, the experimental techniques developed by Wundt, James, Ebbinghaus, and others re-emerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivist and, eventually, constituted a part of the wider, interdisciplinary [[cognitive science]].<ref>Gardner, H.

ISBN 0-465-04635-5</ref><ref name=Mandler /> Some called this development the [[cognitive revolution]] because it rejected the anti-mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis.<ref name=Mandler>Mandler, G. (2007). A history of modern experimental psychology: From James and Wundt to cognitive science. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>

[[Albert Bandura]] helped along the transition in psychology from behaviorism to cognitive psychology. Bandura and other [[Social learning theory|social learning theorists]] advanced the idea of vicarious learning. In other words, they advanced the view that a child can learn by observing his or her social environment and not necessarily from having been reinforced for enacting a behavior, although they did not rule out the influence of reinforcement on learning a behavior.<ref>Bandura, A. (1973). Aggression: A social learning analysis. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.</ref>

[[File:Müller-Lyer illusion.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The [[Müller–Lyer illusion]]. Psychologists make inferences about mental processes from shared phenomena such as optical illusions.]]
Technological advances also renewed interest in mental states and mental representations. English neuroscientist [[Charles Sherrington]] and Canadian psychologist [[Donald O. Hebb]] used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena to the structure and function of the brain. The rise of computer science, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence underlined the value of comparing information processing in humans and machines.

A popular and representative topic in this area is [[cognitive bias]], or irrational thought. Psychologists (and economists) have classified and described a [[List of cognitive biases|sizeable catalogue of biases]] which recur frequently in human thought. The [[availability heuristic]], for example, is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something which happens to come readily to mind.<ref>{{Citation|last=Juslin|first=Peter|title=Availability Heuristic|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Mind|year=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452257044.n39|isbn=978-1-4129-5057-2}}</ref>

Elements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] and American psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]].

On a broader level, cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise involving cognitive psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, linguists, and researchers in artificial intelligence, human–computer interaction, and [[computational neuroscience]]. The discipline of cognitive science covers cognitive psychology as well as philosophy of mind, computer science, and neuroscience.<ref>{{Citation|last=Thagard|first=Paul|title=Cognitive Science|date=2020|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/cognitive-science/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2020|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=22 January 2021}}</ref> Computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest.

{{See also|Social psychology (sociology)}}

Social psychology is concerned with how [[behavior]]s, [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, and the social environment influence human interactions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Allport|first=G. W|year=1985|title=The Historical Background of Social Psychology|editor1-last=G. Lindzey and E. Aronson|encyclopedia=The Handbook of Social Psychology|location=New York|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]|page=5}}</ref> Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]], [[persuasion]]) and the formation of beliefs, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[stereotype]]s about other people. [[Social cognition]] fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology for the purpose of understanding how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of [[group dynamics]] involves research on the nature of leadership, organizational communication, and related phenomena. In recent years, social psychologists have become interested in [[Implicit Association Test|implicit]] measures, [[mediation (statistics)|mediational]] models, and the interaction of person and social factors in accounting for behavior. Some concepts that [[sociology|sociologists]] have applied to the study of psychiatric disorders, concepts such as the social role, sick role, social class, life events, culture, migration, and [[total institution]], have influenced social psychologists.<ref>Tausig, M., & Fenwick, R.

=== Psychoanalytic ===
{{main|Psychodynamics|psychoanalysis}}
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark.jpg|thumb|left|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: Sigmund Freud, G. Stanley Hall, Carl Jung; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]].]]

[[Psychoanalysis]] refers to the theories and therapeutic techniques applied to the unconscious mind and its impact on everyday life. These theories and techniques inform treatments for mental disorders.<ref>Thompson, C. & Mullahy, P. (1951). ''Psychoanalysis: Evolution and development (3rd ed.)''.

(1968), A Glossary of Psychoanalytic Terms and Concepts, Amer Psychoanalytic Assn, p. 78, {{ISBN|978-0-318-13125-2}}</ref> Psychoanalysis originated in the 1890s, most prominently with the work of [[Sigmund Freud]]. Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, [[introspection]], and clinical observation. It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[psychological repression|repression]], and the unconscious.<ref>Kozulin, ''Psychology in Utopia'' (1984), pp. 84–86.</ref> Freud pioneered the methods of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] and [[dream interpretation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Freud, S|year=1900|title=The Interpretation of Dreams|edition= 2nd|publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955|volume=IV and V}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Freud, S |title=The Unconscious |year=1915 |edition= 2nd |volume=XIV |publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955}}</ref>

Psychoanalytic theory is not monolithic. Other well known psychoanalytic thinkers who diverged with Freud include [[Alfred Adler]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Melanie Klein]], [[Donald Winnicott|D.W. Winnicott]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[John Bowlby]], Freud's daughter [[Anna Freud]], and [[Harry Stack Sullivan]]. These individuals ensured that psychoanalysis would evolve into diverse schools of thought. Among these schools are [[ego psychology]], [[object relations]], and [[interpersonal psychoanalysis|interpersonal]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]], and [[relational psychoanalysis]].

Psychologists such as [[Hans Eysenck]] and philosophers including [[Karl Popper]] sharply criticized psychoanalysis. Popper argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as a scientific discipline,<ref name="Popper">Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations, London: Routledge and Keagan Paul, 1963, pp. 33–39; from Theodore Schick, ed., Readings in the Philosophy of Science, Mountain View, CA: Mayfield Publishing Company, 2000, pp. 9–13. [http://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/Popper.doc Faculty.washington.edu]</ref> whereas Eysenck advanced the view that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by [[experiment]]al data. By the end of 20th century, psychology departments in [[Higher education in the United States|American universities]] mostly marginalized Freudian theory, dismissing it as a "desiccated and dead" historical artifact.<ref name=Cohen>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/weekinreview/25cohen.html?_r=3&ref=education&oref&oref=slogin June 2008 study]</ref> Researchers such as [[António Damásio]], [[Oliver Sacks]], and [[Joseph LeDoux]], and individuals in the emerging field of [[neuro-psychoanalysis]], have defended some of Freud's ideas on scientific grounds.<ref>Damásio, A.

It emphasizes subjective meaning, the rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists [[Abraham Maslow]], who formulated a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of human needs]], and [[Carl Rogers]], who created and developed [[client-centered therapy]].

Later, [[positive psychology]] opened up humanistic themes to scientific study. Positive psychology is the study of factors which contribute to human happiness and well-being, focusing more on people who are currently healthy. In 2010, ''Clinical Psychological Review'' published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as [[gratitude journal]]ing and the physical expression of gratitude. It is, however, far from clear that positive psychology is effective in making people happier.<ref name = "Ehrenreich">Ehrenreich, B. (2009).

The ''American Association for Humanistic Psychology'', formed in 1963, declared:

<blockquote>Humanistic psychology is primarily an orientation toward the whole of psychology rather than a distinct area or school. It stands for respect for the worth of persons, respect for differences of approach, open-mindedness as to acceptable methods, and interest in exploration of new aspects of human behavior. As a "third force" in contemporary psychology, it is concerned with topics having little place in existing theories and systems: e.g., love, creativity, self, growth, organism, basic need-gratification, self-actualization, higher values, being, becoming, spontaneity, play, humor, affection, naturalness, warmth, ego-transcendence, objectivity, autonomy, responsibility, meaning, fair-play, transcendental experience, peak experience, courage, and related concepts.<ref>A.J.

Existential psychology emphasizes the need to understand a client's total orientation towards the world. Existential psychology is opposed to reductionism, behaviorism, and other  methods that objectify the individual.<ref name="Oxford University Press 2015"/> In the 1950s and 1960s, influenced by philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], psychoanalytically trained American psychologist [[Rollo May]] helped to develop existential psychology. [[Existential therapy|Existential psychotherapy]], which follows from existential psychology, is a therapeutic approach that is based on the idea that a person's inner conflict arises from that individual's confrontation with the givens of existence. Swiss psychoanalyst [[Ludwig Binswanger]] and American psychologist [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] may also be said to belong to the existential school.<ref name="Hergenhahn3">{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, California |year=2005 |pages=528–536}}</ref> Existential psychologists tend to differ from more "humanistic" psychologists in the former's relatively neutral view of human nature and relatively positive assessment of anxiety.<ref name="Hergenhahn4">{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, California |year=2005 |pages=546–547}}</ref> Existential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death, free will, and meaning, suggesting that meaning can be shaped by myths and narratives; meaning can be deepened by the acceptance of free will, which is requisite to living an [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] life, albeit often with anxiety with regard to death.<ref name="Hergenhahn">{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, California |year=2005 |pages=523–532}}</ref>

=== Personality ===
{{main|Personality psychology}}
Personality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools of thought. Each theory carries different assumptions about such features as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the [[id, ego, and super-ego]].<ref>Carver, C., & Scheier, M. (2004). Perspectives on Personality (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson.</ref> By contrast, [[trait theorist]]s have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits. Trait theorists have often employed statistical data-reduction methods, such as [[factor analysis]]. Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, [[Hans Eysenck]]'s early biologically-based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality, [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion–introversion]], [[neuroticism]]-stability, and [[psychoticism]]-normality. [[Raymond Cattell]] empirically derived a theory of [[16 personality factors]] at the primary-factor level and up to eight broader second-stratum factors.<ref>Cattell, R.B. (1995).

Since the 1980s, the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] ([[openness to experience]], [[conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], and [[neuroticism]]) emerged as an important trait theory of personality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lucas |first1=Richard E. |last2=Baird |first2=Brendan M. |title=Extraversion and Emotional Reactivity. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=2004 |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=473–485 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.3.473 |pmid=15008650 }}</ref> Dimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment has been included in the [[DSM-V]]. However, despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the "Big Five" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan.<ref>Boyle, G.J.

An early example of personality assessment was the [[Woodworth Personal Data Sheet]], constructed during World War I. The popular, although psychometrically inadequate, [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1742-9544.1995.tb01750.x |title=Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI): Some Psychometric Limitations |journal=Australian Psychologist |volume=30 |pages=71–74 |year=1995 |last1=Boyle |first1=Gregory J. }}</ref> was developed to assess individuals' "personality types" according to the [[Psychological Types|personality theories of Carl Jung]]. The [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI), despite its name, is more a dimensional measure of psychopathology than a personality measure.<ref>Leslie C.

=== Unconscious mind ===
{{see also|Unconscious mind#Psychology}}
Study of the unconscious mind, a part of the psyche outside the individual's awareness but that is believed to influence conscious thought and behavior, was a hallmark of early psychology. In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, [[C.S. Peirce]] and [[Joseph Jastrow]] found in 1884 that research subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference.<ref>Charles Sanders Peirce & Joseph Jastrow, "[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm On Small Differences in Sensation]", ''Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences'' 3, 17 October 1884; cited in William P.

Kihlstrom, "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iXMQq7wg-qkC&oi=fnd&pg=PA424 The Psychological Unconscious]", in Lawrence Pervin & Oliver John (eds.), ''Handbook of Personality''; New York: Guilford Press, 1999.

The concept of unconscious processes has remained important in psychology. Cognitive psychologists have used a "filter" model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain stimuli, limited by their nature and number, make their way through the filter. Much research has shown that subconscious ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]'' of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.<ref name=Kihlstrom1999 /> Because of the unreliability of self-reporting, a major hurdle in this type of research involves demonstrating that a subject's conscious mind has not perceived a target stimulus. For this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between ''[[implicit memory|implicit]]'' and ''[[explicit memory|explicit]]'' memory. In another approach, one can also describe a [[subliminal stimulus]] as meeting an ''objective'' but not a ''subjective'' threshold.<ref name=BanksFarber>William P.

=== Motivation ===
{{Main|Motivation}}
Some psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a particular time. It also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a behavior. Psychologists such as William James initially used the term ''motivation'' to refer to intention, in a sense similar to the concept of ''[[Will (philosophy)|will]]'' in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.<ref name=ForgasEtAl>Forgas, Williams, & Laham, "Social Motivation: Introduction and Overview", in Forgas, Williams, & Laham, ''Social Motivation'' (2005).</ref> According to [[drive theory]], the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system. Psychoanalysts believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, "The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation" (pp. 9–84).</ref> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<ref name=ForgasEtAl /><ref name=GodsilEtAl>Bill P. Godsil, Matthew R. Tinsley, & Michael S. Fanselow, "Motivation", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 4: ''Experimental Psychology''.</ref> [[Clark Hull]] formalized the latter idea with his [[Drive reduction theory (learning theory)|drive reduction]] model.<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 3, "Drive Theory" (pp. 85–138).</ref>

Hunger, thirst, fear, sexual desire, and thermoregulation constitute fundamental motivations in animals.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Humans seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations—though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from desires for belonging, positive self-image, self-consistency, truth, love, and control.<ref>[[E. Tory Higgins]], ''Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works''; Oxford University Press, 2012; {{ISBN|978-0-19-976582-9}}{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref><ref>Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008), entire volume.{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>

Motivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways. Researchers have found that [[eating]], for example, depends not only on the organism's fundamental need for [[homeostasis]]—an important factor causing the experience of hunger—but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and cost.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Abstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as ''goal contagion'': the adoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of others.<ref>Hank Aarts, Ap Dijksterhuis, & Giel Dik, "Goal Contagion: Inferring goals from others' actions—and what it leads to", in Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008). "In short, then, the studies presented above indicate that humans are keen to act on the goals of other social beings that are implied in behavioral scenarios or scripts."

They suggest that this principle can even apply to food, drink, sex, and sleep.<ref>Kathleen D. Vohs & [[Roy F. Baumeister]], "Can Satisfaction Reinforce Wanting?

=== Development psychology ===
{{Main|Developmental psychology}}[[File:Baby with book.jpg|thumb|upright|Developmental psychologists would engage a child with a book and then make observations based on how the child interacts with the object.]]

Developmental psychology refers to the scientific study of how and why the thought processes, emotions, and behaviors of humans change over the course of their lives.<ref name = "Crain"/> Some credit Charles Darwin with conducting the first systematic study within the rubric of developmental psychology, having published in 1877 a short paper detailing the development of innate forms of communication based on his observations of his infant son.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Developmental Psychology {{!}} Simply Psychology|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/developmental-psychology.html|access-date=2021-10-15|website=www.simplypsychology.org}}</ref> The main origins of the discipline, however, are found in the work of [[Jean Piaget]]. Like Piaget, developmental psychologists originally focused primarily on the development of cognition from infancy to adolescence. Later, developmental psychology extended itself to the study cognition over the life span. In addition to studying cognition, developmental psychologists have also come to focus on affective, behavioral, moral, social, and neural development.

Developmental psychologists who study children use a number of research methods. For example, they make observations of children in natural settings such as preschools<ref>Lionetti, F., Aron, E. N., Aron, A., Klein, D. N., & Pluess, M. (2019). Observer-rated environmental sensitivity moderates children’s response to parenting quality in early childhood.

=== Genes and environment ===
{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}

All researched psychological traits are influenced by both [[genes]] and [[social environment|environment]], to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.3285 |pmid=25985137 |title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=702–709 |year=2015 |last1=Polderman |first1=Tinca J C. |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=De Leeuw |first3=Christiaan A. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Patrick F. |last5=Van Bochoven |first5=Arjen |last6=Visscher |first6=Peter M. |last7=Posthuma |first7=Danielle |s2cid=205349969 |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364460/UQ364460_OA.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00084 |title=Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=160–164 |year=2000 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric |s2cid=2861437 }}</ref> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals and families. An example of this confounding can be shown in the transmission of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] from a depressed mother to her offspring. A theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an offspring, by virtue of his or her having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother, is at risk for developing depression. On the other hand, a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in an offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother. Genes and environment in these simple transmission models are completely confounded. A depressed mother may both carry genes that contribute to depression in her offspring and also create a rearing environment that increases the risk of depression in her child.

[[Behavioral genetics]] researchers have employed methodologies that help to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.<ref name="Behavior Genetics" /> Traditionally the research has involved [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]], two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, gene-focused research has contributed to understanding genetic contributions to the development of psychological traits.

The availability of [[microarray]] [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] or [[genome sequencing]] technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and [[psychopathology]] through methods including [[genome-wide association studies]]. One goal of such research is similar to that in [[positional cloning]] and its success in [[Huntington's]]: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly [[polygenic]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.029 |pmid=22243964 |pmc=3257326 |title=Five Years of GWAS Discovery |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=7–24 |year=2012 |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter M. |last2=Brown |first2=Matthew A. |last3=McCarthy |first3=Mark I. |last4=Yang |first4=Jian}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature13595 |pmid=25056061 |pmc=4112379 |title=Biological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci |journal=Nature |volume=511 |issue=7510 |pages=421–427 |year=2014 |bibcode=2014Natur.511..421S |last1=Ripke |first1=Stephan |last2=Neale |first2=Benjamin M. |last3=Corvin |first3=Aiden |last4=Walters |first4=James T.

Psychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior.

=== Psychological testing ===
{{see also|Psychometrics|social statistics}}
Psychological testing has ancient origins, dating as far back as 2200 BC, in the [[imperial examination|examinations for the Chinese civil service]]. Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The system was ended in 1906.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 41–42.</ref> In Europe, mental assessment took a different approach, with theories of [[physiognomy]]—judgment of character based on the face—described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 42–43.</ref>

When experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was a leading practitioner. By virtue of his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, he is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as ''[[psychometrics]]'').<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 44–45.</ref> James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the idea of psychological testing to the United States, and in fact coined the term "mental test".<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 45–46.</ref> In 1901, Cattell's student [[Clark Wissler]] published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict academic performance.<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46 /> In response to 1904 orders from the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of Public Instruction]], French psychologists [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Théodore Simon]] developed and elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905–1911. They used a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of [[mental age]] and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as ''[[idiot]]s''. [[Henry H. Goddard]] put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as ''imbecile'' and ''feebleminded''. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford–Binet scale]]) and introduced the [[intelligence quotient]] as a score report.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 50–56.</ref> Based on his test findings, and reflecting the racism common to that era, Terman concluded that mental retardation "represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial."<ref name=Guthrie1998Chapter3>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 3: "Psychometric Scientism" (pp. 55–87)</ref>

Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests, which was developed by psychologist [[Robert Yerkes]] in 1917 and then used in World War 1 by industrial and organizational psychologists for large-scale employee testing and selection of military personnel.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Mental testing also became popular in the U.S., where it was applied to schoolchildren. The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s. In 1926, the [[College Entrance Examination Board]] created the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] to standardize college admissions.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 61.</ref> The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions, including the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor. These practices were criticized by Black intellectuals such a [[Horace Mann Bond]] and [[Allison Davis (anthropologist)|Allison Davis]].<ref name=Guthrie1998Chapter3 /> Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded.<ref name=GuthrieChapter4 /> In the United States, tens of thousands of men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent that has never been overturned, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1927 case ''[[Buck v. Bell]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Berry | first1 = Robert M. | title = From Involuntary Sterilization to Genetic Enhancement: The Unsettled Legacy of Buck v.

Today mental testing is a routine phenomenon for people of all ages in Western societies.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 2. "From birth to old age, we encounter tests at almost every turning point in life. […] Tests are used in almost every nation on earth for counseling, selection, and placement. Testing occurs in settings as diverse as schools, civil service, industry, medical clinics, and counseling centers. Most persons have taken dozens of tests and thought nothing of it. Yet, by the time the typical individual reaches retirement age, it is likely that psychological test results will have helped to shape his or her destiny."</ref> Modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure, [[reliability (psychometrics)|consistency of results]], output of an interpretable score, statistical norms describing population outcomes, and, ideally, [[test validity|effective prediction]] of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 4–6.</ref> Developments in psychometrics include work on test and scale [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[test validity|validity]].<ref>Nunnally, J.

=== Mental health care ===
{{see also|Clinical psychology}}
The provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U.S. Sometimes, however, members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in practices that resemble that of clinical psychologists. Clinical psychologists typically include people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology. In Canada, some of the members of the abovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of [[professional psychology]]. In Canada and the U.S., practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates; doctoral students in clinical psychology usually spend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internship. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctoral degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<ref name=HallHurley /> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<ref name=StrickerWidiger /> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychological distress, dysfunction, and/or [[mental illness]]. Clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective well-being and personal growth. Central to the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name="brain">Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}</ref>

Credit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to [[Lightner Witmer]], who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was [[Morton Prince]], an early advocate for the establishment of psychology as a clinical and academic discipline.<ref name=StrickerWidiger>George Stricker & Thomas A. Widiger, "Volume Preface", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref> In the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by psychiatrists, who are medical doctors. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve the diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.<ref name=Tomes2008 /><ref>[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, "Psychodynamic Psychotherapy", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>

Psychotherapy as conducted by psychiatrists blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]]. Some in the clinical psychology community adopted [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model that used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] emerged with the work of [[Albert Ellis]] and [[Aaron Beck]]. Although there are similarities between behavior therapy and cognitive-behavior therapy, cognitive-behavior therapy required the application of cognitive constructs. Since the 1970s, the popularity of cognitive-behavior therapy among clinical psychologists increased. A key practice in behavioral ''and'' cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<ref>W. Edward Craighead & Linda Wilcoxon Craighead, "Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>

Mental health care today involves psychologists and [[social work]]ers in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director [[Bertram S. Brown|Bertram Brown]] described this shift as a source of "intense competition and role confusion."<ref name=Tomes2008>Nancy Tomes, "The Development of Clinical Psychology, Social Work, and Psychiatric Nursing: 1900–1980s", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in clinical psychology emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. The PhD degree is intended to train practitioners who could also conduct scientific research. The PsyD degree is more exclusively designed to train practitioners.<ref name=HallHurley />

Some clinical psychologists focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury. This subspecialty is known as [[clinical neuropsychology]]. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The emerging field of ''disaster psychology'' (see [[crisis intervention]]) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<ref>Teri L. Elliott, "Disaster Psychology: Keep Clients out of Your Office—Get into the Field!" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). "...it is the disaster psychologist's role to utilize crisis intervention processes with the goal of preventing natural distress due to the critical event from developing into a more harmful, long-term psychological condition."</ref>

The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential–humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223–1233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377–400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |s2cid=142840311 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=tpr }}</ref> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124–130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}</ref><ref>Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

Diagnosis in clinical psychology usually follows the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM).<ref>Peter E. Nathan & James Langenbucher, "Diagnosis and Classification", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref> The study of mental illnesses is called [[abnormal psychology]].

=== Education ===
{{Main|Educational psychology|School psychology}}
[[File:Figural Relationships.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|An example of an item from a cognitive abilities test used in educational psychology.]]
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of [[school]]s as organizations. Educational psychologists can be found in preschools, schools of all levels including post secondary institutions, community organizations and learning centers, Government or private research firms, and independent or private consultant<ref>{{Cite web|title=What Does An Educational Psychologist Do {{!}} Touro University {{!}} Psychology|url=https://www.tuw.edu/program-resources/educational-psychologist/|access-date=2021-09-30|website=Touro University WorldWide|language=en-US}}</ref> <nowiki>[[Madisonodell5/sandbox]]</nowiki>. The work of developmental psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices. Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

School psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students; to facilitate [[prosocial behavior]]s in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments. School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Association of School Psychologists |title=Who are school psychologists? |url=http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |access-date=1 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517055058/http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |archive-date=17 May 2008 }}</ref>

=== Work ===
{{see also|Industrial and organizational psychology|Organizational behavior}}
Industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals' work-lives.<ref>Truxillo, D. M., Bauer, T. N., & Erdogan, B. (2016). ''Psychology and work: Perspectives on industrial and organizational psychology''. New York:  Psychology Press. {{ISBN|1134705697}}</ref> In the field's beginnings, industrialists brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of [[scientific management]] techniques for improving workplace efficiency. The field was at first called ''economic psychology'' or ''business psychology''; later, ''industrial psychology'', ''employment psychology'', or ''psychotechnology''.<ref name=Koppes>Laura L. Koppes, "Industrial-Organizational Psychology", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 1: ''History of Psychology''.</ref> An influential early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924 to 1932. Western Electric experimented on factory workers to assess their responses to changes in illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term [[Hawthorne effect]] is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.<ref>Yeh Hsueh, "The Hawthorne experiments and the introduction of Jean Piaget in American industrial psychology, 1929–1932"; ''History of Psychology'' 5.2, May 2002.</ref> Although the Hawthorne research can be found in psychology textbooks, the research and its findings, however, were weak at best.<ref>{{cite journal |first=H.

The name industrial and organizational psychology emerged in the 1960s. In 1973, it became enshrined in the name of the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]], Division 14 of the American Psychological Association.<ref name=Koppes /> One goal of the discipline is to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology is a subfield of I/O psychology. Personnel psychologists apply the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers. Another subfield, [[organizational psychology]], examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity.<ref>Myers (2004). Motivation and work. ''Psychology''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers</ref> Most I/O psychologists work outside of academia, for private and public organizations and as consultants.<ref name=Koppes /> A psychology consultant working in business today might expect to provide executives with information and ideas about their industry, their target markets, and the organization of their company.<ref>Steven Williams, "Executive Management: Helping Executives Manage Their Organizations through Organizational and Market Research" in Morgan et al.

Organizational behavior (OB) is an allied field involved in the study of human behavior within organizations.<ref>Moorhead, G., & Griffin, R. W. (2017). ''Organizational behavior: Managing people and organizations, 12th ed.''. Boston: Cengage. {{ISBN|978-1-305-50139-3}}</ref> One way to differentiate I/O psychology from OB is to note that I/O psychologists train in university psychology departments and OB specialists, in business schools.

=== Military and intelligence ===
One role for psychologists in the military has been to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel. In the U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia|Fort Oglethorpe]] in Georgia. The school provided psychological training for military staff.<ref name=Tomes2008 /><ref>[[Robert M.

Psychologists may also work on a diverse set of campaigns known broadly as psychological warfare. Psychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. This so-called black propaganda is designed to seem as if it originates from a source other than the Army.<ref>[[Cordwainer Smith|Paul M.A. Linebarger]], ''Psychological Warfare''; Washington: Combat Forces Press, 1954.</ref> The [[CIA]]'s [[MKULTRA]] program involved more individualized efforts at [[mind control]], involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of [[LSD]].<ref>See "[https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/13inmate_ProjectMKULTRA.pdf Project MKULTRA, the CIA's Program of Research in Behavioral Modification]"; Joint Hearing before the Senate Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Committee on Human Resources, United States Senate, Ninety Fifth Congress, First Session, 3 August 1997; and [[John D.

=== Health, well-being, and social change ===
{{see also|Health psychology|Social issues|Occupational health psychology}}

====Social change====
An example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]]. These two African American psychologists studied segregation's adverse psychological impact on Black children. Their research findings played a role in the desegregation case ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954).<ref>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 7: "Production of Black Psychologists in America" (pp. 155–213).</ref>

The impact of psychology on social change includes the discipline's broad influence on teaching and learning. Research has shown that compared to the "whole word" or "whole language" approach, the phonics approach to reading instruction is more efficacious.<ref>Chall, J. S. (1995). ''Learning to read: The great debate'', 3rd ed. Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace.</ref>

====Medical applications====
Medical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles. One aspect of health psychology is the [[psychoeducation]] of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen. Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance.<ref>Marilu Price Berry, "Interdisciplinary Medical Setting: The Multiple Roles of a Health Psychologist" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005).</ref><ref>Robiner, W. N., & Seime, R. J. (2008). Psychologists in academic health centers: Traditions and innovations in education, science, and practice. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings, 15'', 3–6. {{doi|10.1007/s10880-008-9091-1}}</ref> Psychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior. These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies. Psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole [[population]]s of people.<ref>Monica L. Baskin, "Public Health: Career Opportunities for Psychologists in Public Health", in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). "Prevention strategies of late have largely concentrated on community-based interventions, which have been shown to be effective in changing the health of large populations. Behavioral and social scientists, such as psychologists, are helpful in this arena as we are trained to view individuals as belonging to complex and dynamic social systems, including immediate and extended family systems, acquaintance and friendship networks, neighborhood and community systems, and cultural groups (Schneiderman & Spee4, 2001)."</ref>

====Worker health, safety and wellbeing====
Psychologists work with organizations to apply findings from psychological research to improve the health and well-being of employees. Some work as external consultants hired by organizations to solve specific problems, whereas others are full-time employees of the organization. Applications include conducting surveys to identify issues and designing interventions to make work healthier. Some of the specific health areas include:
*Accidents and injuries: A major contribution is the concept of [[safety climate]], which is employee shared perceptions of the behaviors that are encouraged (e.g., wearing safety gear) and discouraged (not following safety rules) at work.<ref>Zohar, D. (2010). Thirty years of safety climate research: Reflections and future directions. Accident Analysis and Prevention, 42, 1517-1522.</ref> Organizations with strong safety climates have fewer [[work accidents]] and injuries.<ref>Beus, J. M., McCord, M. A., & Zohar, D. (2016). Workplace safety:A review and research synthesis. Organizational Psychology Review, 6, 352-381. {{doi|10.1177/2041386615626243}}</ref>
*[[Cardiovascular disease]]: Cardiovascular disease has been related to lack of [[Job control (workplace)|job control]].<ref>Clays, E., De Bacquer, D., Delanghe, J., Kittel, F., Van Renterghem, L., & De Backer, G. (2005). Associations Between Dimensions of Job Stress and Biomarkers of Inflammation and Infection. Journal of Occupational & Environmental Medicine, 47, 878-883</ref>
*Mental health: Exposure to [[occupational stress]] is associated with mental health disorder.<ref>Brown, A. D., Schultebraucks, K., Qian, M., Li, M., Horesh, D., Siegel, C., Brody, Y., Amer, A.

Global Mental Health, 7. {{doi|10.1017/gmh.2019.29}}</ref>
*[[Musculoskeletal disorder]]: These are injuries in bones, nerves and tendons due to overexertion and repetitive strain. They have been linked to job satisfaction and workplace stress.<ref>Amiri, S., & Behnezhad, S. (2020). Is job strain a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 longitudinal studies. Public Health, 181, 158-167. {{doi|10.1016/j.puhe.2019.11.023}}</ref>
*Physical health symptoms: Occupational stress has been linked to physical symptoms such as digestive distress and headache.<ref>Nixon, A. E., Mazzola, J. J., Bauer, J., Krueger, J. R., & Spector, P. E. (2011). Can work make you sick? A meta-analysis of the relationships between job stressors and physical symptoms. Work & Stress, 25, 1-22. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02678373.2011.569175</ref>
*[[Workplace violence]]: Violence prevention climate is related to being physically assaulted and psychologically mistreated at work.<ref>Yang, L.-Q., Caughlin, D. E., Gazica, M. W., Truxillo, D. M., & Spector, P. E. (2014). Workplace mistreatment climate and potential employee and organizational outcomes: A meta-analytic review from the target’s perspective. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 19, 315-335. {{doi|10.1037/a0036905}}</ref> 
Interventions that improve climates are a way to address accidents and violence. Interventions that reduce stress at work or provide employees with tools to better manage it can help in areas where stress is an important component.

Industrial psychology became interested in worker fatigue during World War I, when government ministers in Britain were concerned about the impact of fatigue on workers in munitions factories but not other types of factories.<ref>Hochschild, A. (2011). ''To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914–1918''. ISBN 978-0-547-75031-6</ref><ref name="Kreis">Kreis, S. (1995).

K. some interest in worker [[well-being]] emerged with the efforts of [[Charles Samuel Myers]] and his National Institute of Industrial Psychology (NIIP) during the inter-War years.<ref>Kwiatkowski, R., Duncan, D. C., & Shimmin, S. (2006). What have we forgotten - and why?

S. during the mid-twentieth century industrial psychologist [[Arthur Kornhauser]] pioneered the study of occupational mental health, linking industrial working conditions to mental health as well as the spillover of an unsatisfying job into a worker's personal life.<ref name="Zickar">Zickar, M. J. (2003). Remembering Arthur Kornhauser: Industrial psychology’s advocate for worker well-being.

New York: Wiley.</ref> Zickar accumulated evidence to show that "no other industrial psychologist of his era was as devoted to advocating management and labor practices that would improve the lives of working people."<ref name="Zickar"/>

====Occupational health psychology====
As interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century, the field of [[occupational health psychology]] (OHP) emerged. OHP is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinary.<ref name = "Spector1">[https://paulspector.com/what-is-occupational-health-psychology/ Spector, P. (2019).

== Research methods ==
{{Main|Psychological research|List of psychological research methods}}

[[Quantitative psychological research]] lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Some psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled, but more [[Ecological validity|ecologically valid]], [[field experiments]] as well. Other research psychologists rely on statistical methods to glean knowledge from population data.<ref>John A. Schinka & Wayne F. Velicer, "Volume Preface" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> The statistical methods research psychologists employ include the [[Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient]], the [[analysis of variance]], [[multiple linear regression]], [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[hierarchical linear modeling]]. The [[Psychometrics|measurement]] and [[operational definition|operationalization]] of important [[Construct (psychology)|constructs]] is an essential part of these research designs.

Although this type of psychological research is much less abundant than quantitative research, some psychologists conduct [[qualitative research]]. This type of research can involve interviews, questionnaires, and first-hand observation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alasuutari|first1=Pertti|year=2010|title=The rise and relevance of qualitative research|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=139–55|doi=10.1080/13645570902966056|s2cid=143736805}}</ref> While hypothesis testing is rare, virtually impossible, in qualitative research, qualitative studies can be helpful in theory and hypothesis generation, interpreting seemingly contradictory quantitative findings, and understanding why some interventions fail and others succeed.<ref>Schonfeld, I.S., & Mazzola, J.J. (2013). Strengths and limitations of qualitative approaches to research in occupational health psychology. In R. Sinclair, M. Wang, & L.

A [[true experiment]] with [[randomized controlled trial|random]] assignment of research participants (sometimes called subjects) to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships. When there are large numbers of research participants, the random assignment (also called random allocation) of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will, on average, be similar on most characteristics, including characteristics that went unmeasured. In an experiment, the researcher alters one or more variables of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.

A [[Quasi-experimental design|quasi-experiment]] refers to a situation in which there are rival conditions under study but random assignment to the different conditions is not possible. Investigators must work with preexisting groups of people. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref>Melvin M. Mark, "Program Evaluation" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> For example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes and, perhaps, statistically adjust for any initial differences in reading level.

Experimental researchers typically use a [[statistical hypothesis testing]] model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data collected are consistent with the predictions. These predictions are likely to originate from one or more abstract scientific [[hypotheses]] about how the phenomenon under study actually works.<ref>[[Roger E. Kirk]], "Experimental Design" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>

=== Other types of studies ===
[[Survey methodology|Surveys]] are used in psychology for the purpose of measuring [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[trait theory|traits]], monitoring changes in [[mood (psychology)|mood]], and checking the validity of experimental manipulations (checking research participants' perception of the condition they were assigned to). Psychologists have commonly used paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.

[[Observational studies]] are commonly conducted in psychology. In [[Cross-sectional studies|cross-sectional]] observational studies, psychologists collect data at a single point in time. The goal of many cross-sectional studies is the assess the extent factors are correlated with each other. By contrast, in [[longitudinal studies]] psychologists collect data on the same sample at two or more points in time. Sometimes the purpose of longitudinal research is to study trends across time such as the stability of traits or age-related changes in behavior. Because some studies involve endpoints that psychologists cannot ethically study from an experimental standpoint, such as identifying the causes of depression, they conduct longitudinal studies a large group of depression-free people, periodically assessing what is happening in the individuals' lives. In this way psychologists have an opportunity to test causal hypotheses regarding conditions that commonly arise in people's lives that put them at risk for depression. Problems that affect longitudinal studies include [[Selection bias#Attrition|selective attrition]], the type of problem in which bias is introduced when a certain type of research participant disproportionately leaves a study.

[[Exploratory data analysis]] refers to a variety of practices that researchers use to reduce a great many variables to a small number overarching factors. In [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce's three modes of inference]], exploratory data analysis corresponds to [[abduction (logic)|abduction]].<ref>John T. Behrens and Chong-Ho Yu, "Exploratory Data Analysis" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] is the technique research psychologists use to integrate results from many studies of the same variables and arriving at a grand average of the findings.<ref>Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, "Meta-Analysis", ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>

=== Direct brain observation/manipulaiton ===
[[File:EEG cap.jpg|alt=|thumb|An EEG recording setup]]
A classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain. [[Hans Berger]], the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature "brain waves": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the [[delta wave]] observed during non-REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rösler | first1 = Frank | title = From Single-Channel Recordings to Brain-Mapping Devices: The Impact of Electroencephalography on Experimental Psychology | url = http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1037/1093-4510.8.1.95 | pmid = 16021767 | pages = 95–117 | access-date = 24 April 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150907211752/http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | archive-date = 7 September 2015 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Newer [[functional neuroimaging]] techniques include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[positron emission tomography]], both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate—or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic [[neural network]] model rather than a localized function model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = Joseph M. | last2 = Zaki | first2 = Jamil | title = Functional Neuroimaging and Psychology: What Have You Done for Me Lately? | url = http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/518 | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1162/jocn_a_00380 | pages = 834–842 | pmid = 23469884 | s2cid = 12546790 | access-date = 24 April 2015 | archive-date = 2 February 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160202031631/http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/518 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = John T. | last2 = Berntson | first2 = Gary G. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = Howard C. | title = Neuroimaging as a New Tool in the Toolbox of Psychological Science | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00550.x | pages = 62–67 | s2cid = 14565940 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031185051/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | archive-date = 31 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aue | first1 = Tatjana | last2 = Lavelle | first2 = Leah A. | last3 = Cacioppo | first3 = John T. | title = Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena? | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.12.017 | pages = 10–16 | pmid = 19232374 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109084331/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | archive-date = 9 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Psychiatric interventions such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and drugs also provide information about brain–mind interactions. [[Psychopharmacology]] is the study of drug-induced mental effects.

=== Computer simulation ===
{{See also|Computational cognition|Graph theory|Network theory}}
Computational modeling is a tool used in [[mathematical psychology]] and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.<ref>Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.</ref> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.

=== Animal studies ===
[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]

Animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, and rats and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important [[variable (research)|variable]]s for human subjects. There are pitfalls, however, in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title= Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |access-date= 1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708190108/http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |archive-date= 8 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

Comparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]].<ref>Shettleworth, S.J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and Behavior (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.</ref> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the [[Sociobiology]] of [[E.O. Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, E.O. (1978) ''On Human Nature'' p. x, Cambridge, Ma: Harvard</ref> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.

=== Qualitative research ===
Qualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals. Qualitative research involving first-hand observation can help describe events as they occur, with the goal of capturing the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations are made.

[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identified five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, [[ethnography]], [[case study]], and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers<ref>Glaser, B. & Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.</ref> sometimes aim to enrich our understanding of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes [[hermeneutic]] and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in [[Erich Fromm]]'s application of psychological and sociological theories, in his book ''[[Escape from Freedom]]'', to understanding why many ordinary Germans supported Hitler.<ref>Fromm, E. (1941). ''Escape from freedom.'' New York: Farrar & Rinehart. {{ISBN|0-7448-0014-5}}</ref>

[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P. Gage]] survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and is remembered for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior.<ref>[[Phineas Gage#References|Harlow (1868)]], Fig. 2, p. 347 Harlow, John Martyn (1868). "Recovery from the Passage of an Iron Bar through the Head." Publications of the Massachusetts Medical Society 2:327–347 (Republished in Macmillan 2000).</ref>]]

Just as [[Jane Goodall]] studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct [[naturalistic observation]] of ongoing human social, professional, and family life. Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.

===Program evaluation===
[[Program evaluation]] involves the systematic collection, analysis, and application of information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs, particularly about their effectiveness.<ref>Fitzpatrick, J.L., Sanders, J.R., & Worthen, B.R. (2011). ''Program evaluation: Alternative approaches and practical guidelines''. New York: Pearson Higher Education. {{ISBN|978-0-205-57935-8}}.</ref><ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know the extent which the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving, or objecting to are producing the intended effects. While program evaluation first focuses on effectiveness, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|ssrn=3060080|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>

Arnett (2008), Altmaier, and Hall (2008) and Morgan-Consoli et al. (2018) view the Western bias in research and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in WEIRD regions in their research, clinical work, and consultation with populations around the world.<ref name="Arnett2008" /><ref name="AltmaierHall2008">{{cite book | last1 = Altmaier | first1 = E.

=== Unscientific mental health training ===
Some observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application—in particular, the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices.<ref name=Cards>{{cite book |last=Dawes |first=Robyn |title=House of Cards – Psychology and Psychotherapy Built on Myth |year=1994 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0-02-907205-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/houseofcardspsyc00dawerich }}</ref> Critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence.<ref name="Beyerstein2001">{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.3147 |title=Fringe Psychotherapies: The Public at Risk |first1=Barry L. |last1=Beyerstein |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2001 |pages=70–9 }}</ref> Practices such as "[[facilitated communication]] for infantile autism"; memory-recovery techniques including [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|body work]]; and other therapies, such as [[Rebirthing (breathwork)|rebirthing]] and [[reparenting]], may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srmhp.org/0101/raison-detre.html |title=SRMHP: Our Raison d'Être |access-date=1 July 2008}}</ref> These practices, however, are outside the mainstream practices taught in clinical psychology doctoral programs.

== Ethics ==
Ethical standards in the discipline have changed over time. Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of [[Guidelines for human subject research#APA Ethics Code|established codes]] (the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]). The American Psychological Association has advanced a set of ethical principles and a code of conduct for the profession.<ref>American Psychological Association. (2016). Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct.[https://www.apa.org/ethics/code]</ref>

The most important contemporary standards include informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential but ethically dubious studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[Walter E. Fernald Developmental Center#Nuclear medicine research in children|MIT-Harvard Fernald School radioisotope studies]], the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the [[Hepatitis#Willowbrook State School experiments|Willowbrook hepatitis study]], and [[Milgram experiment|Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority]].

=== Humans ===
Universities have ethics committees dedicated to protecting the rights (e.g., voluntary nature of the research, privacy) and well-being (e.g., minimizing distress) of research participants. University ethics committees evaluate proposed research to ensure that researchers protect the rights and well-being of participants; an investigator's research project cannot be conducted unless approved by such an ethics committee.<ref>The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]</ref>

The ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as "Ethical Standards of Psychologists". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between "aspirational" ethical standards and "enforceable" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<ref name=HandbookJones>Stanley E. Jones, "Ethical Issues in Clinical Psychology", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>

Some of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is [[informed consent]], the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.<ref name=HandbookJones /> Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct.<ref name=HandbookJones />

=== Other animals ===
Research on other animals is also governed by university ethics committees. Research on nonhuman animals cannot proceed without permission of the ethics committee of the researcher's home institution. Current ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Christionsen | first2 = S.B. | last3 = Duncan | first3 = I.J. | last4 = Erhard | first4 = H.W. | last5 = Lay Jr. | first5 = D.C. | last6 = Mench | first6 = J.A. | last7 = O'Connor | first7 = C.E. | last8 = Petherick | first8 = J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 291–305 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00288-5}}</ref> Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.
* Comparative psychologist [[Harry Harlow]] drew moral condemnation for [[pit of despair|isolation experiments]] on rhesus macaque monkeys at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in the 1970s.<ref>Blum 1994, p. 95, Blum 2002, pp. 218–219. Blum 1994, p. 95: "... the most controversial experiment to come out of the Wisconsin laboratory, a device that Harlow insisted on calling the 'pit of despair.{{'"}}</ref> The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression. Harlow also devised what he called a "rape rack", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture.<ref>Blum, Deborah. Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection. Perseus Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7382-0278-9}}</ref> In 1974, American literary critic [[Wayne C. Booth]] wrote that, "Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties." He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.<ref>Booth, Wayne C. ''Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent'', Volume 5, of University of Notre Dame, Ward-Phillips lectures in English language and literature, University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 114. Booth is explicitly discussing this experiment. His next sentence is, "His most recent outrage consists of placing monkeys in 'solitary' for twenty days—what he calls a 'vertical chamber apparatus .... designed on an intuitive basis' to produce 'a state of helplessness and hopelessness, sunken in a well of despair.{{'"}}</ref>
