==History==
{{See also|List of Goucher College people#Presidents}}

=== 19th century ===
[[File:John Goucher.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|upright|[[John Goucher|John F. Goucher]], who was the school's co-founder and second president, became its namesake in 1913.]]
In 1881, the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church passed a resolution to found a seminary. The proposal was met with some objection, with one member stating, "I would not give a fig for a weakling little thing of a seminary. We want such a school, so ample in its provisions, of such dignity in its buildings, so fully provided with the best apparatus, that it shall draw to itself the eyes of the community and that young people shall feel it an honor to be enrolled among its students."<ref name=":7" /> Minister and conference member [[John B. Van Meter]] asserted "that the Conference [should] make the foundation and endowment of a female college the single object of its organized effort."<ref name=":7" />

Van Meter was joined by fellow minister John Franklin Goucher (1845–1922) and together they eventually persuaded the conference to found a college, instead.<ref name=":7">Knipp, Anna Heubeck, and Thaddeus P. Thomas. ''The History of Goucher College.'' Baltimore: Goucher College, 1938. https://archive.org/details/historyofgoucher00knip</ref> Subsequently, the '''Women's College of Baltimore City''' ("City" was later dropped) was chartered on January 26, 1885. It opened its doors in 1888, and four years later graduated its first class of just five students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goucher.edu/explore/who-we-are/history/timeline|title=Timeline |publisher=Goucher College|language=en|access-date=2018-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827142407/https://www.goucher.edu/explore/who-we-are/history/timeline|archive-date=2018-08-27|url-status=live}}</ref>

John F. Goucher, despite being the school's namesake and his role in its founding, was not the college's first president. Although offered the post, he declined, and it instead went to [[William Hersey Hopkins]], who had served as president of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=John Franklin Goucher : citizen of the world|author=Marilyn Southard Warshawsky|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2016|isbn=9781530254163|oclc=961105648}}</ref>  After Hopkins resigned in 1890 to join the faculty, the board of trustees voted unanimously to renominate Goucher for the role. Under pressure from the board, Goucher relented and accepted the position, which he went on to hold for nearly two decades. Goucher and his wife Mary Cecilia Fisher also made significant financial contributions to the college, to which he bequeathed a portion of his estate.<ref name=":7" />

=== 20th century ===
During President Goucher's tenure, the college's enrollment grew but it also suffered financial deficits.<ref name=":7" /> In 1904, the college became the second in Maryland to establish a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] chapter, after [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://goucherpbk.wordpress.com/history-of-our-chapter/|title=History of Our Chapter|date=2015-04-12|work=Goucher College: Phi Beta Kappa|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827142335/https://goucherpbk.wordpress.com/history-of-our-chapter/|archive-date=2018-08-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Goucher stepped down in 1908 to resume his international missionary work but remained involved with the school as president emeritus until his death in 1922.<ref name=":5" /> In 1910, the school was renamed '''Goucher College''' in his honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goucher.edu/library/special-collections-and-archives/exhibits/building-a-greater-goucher-the-history-of-the-towson-campus/honored-individuals/john-franklin-goucher|title=John Franklin Goucher|publisher=Goucher College|language=en|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref>

In 1913, the college inaugurated its fourth president, [[William Westley Guth|William W. Guth]], who oversaw the construction of several new residence halls and a successful million-dollar fundraising campaign.<ref name=":7" /> [[File:Goucher College Former Baltimore Campus.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|A colorized postcard photo of Goucher's Baltimore campus ''circa'' 1920]] Around this time, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]], whose daughter [[Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre|Jessie]] was a Goucher alumna, expressed support for the college's fundraising efforts in correspondences with the administration, writing in March 1913, "It would, indeed, be&nbsp;... evidence that our great educational public does not fully understand its own interests if an institution which has served with such faithfulness&nbsp;... in the cause of woman's [sic] education should be allowed to break up for the lack of money."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://presidentwilson.org/items/show/10918|title=Woodrow Wilson to Friends of Goucher College |website=presidentwilson.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812022357/http://presidentwilson.org/items/show/10918|archive-date=2018-08-12|url-status=live}}</ref> By 1914, Goucher was one of six "Class I" colleges for women in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |title=Goucher College |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n42/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 6, 1914 |access-date=August 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230183553/http://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n42/mode/1up#page/n42/mode/1up |archive-date=2012-12-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1921, Goucher purchased 421 acres of land in nearby Towson that had belonged to the estate of a prominent Baltimore family for $150,000,<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofgoucher00knip|title=The History of Goucher College|last1=Thomas|first1=Thaddeus|last2=Knipp|first2=Anna Heubeck|publisher=Goucher College|year=1938|page=20}}</ref> some of which was later resold to provide funding for construction and other expenses.<ref name=":12"/> The move from Baltimore to the Towson suburbs was completed in 1953 after having been delayed by financial difficulties imposed by the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]].<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":12" /> [[File:Goucher College Seal 1923.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|The college's original seal]] Before 1950, Goucher hosted nearly a dozen sorority chapters on campus including [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], and [[Pi Beta Phi]].
