'''Diego Gambetta''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdjеːɡo ɡamˈbetta}}; born 1952) is an Italian-born [[Social science|social scientist]]. He is a professor of [[social theory]] at the [[European University Institute]] in Florence, a Carlo Alberto Chair at the [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]] in Turin, and an official fellow at [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]], [[University of Oxford]]. He is well known for his vivid and unconventional applications of [[Economics#Theory|economic theory]] and a [[rational choice theory]] approach to understanding a variety of social phenomena. He has made important analytical contributions to the concept of [[Trust (social science)|trust]] by using [[game theory]] and [[signalling theory]].<ref>{{Cite book|editor-first=Karen S.|editor-last=Cook|title=Trust in Signs|publisher=[[Russell Sage Foundation]]|date=March 2003|location=New York City|pages=148–184|isbn=978-0-87154-181-9}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1983 Gambetta received his PhD in social and political sciences from the [[University of Cambridge]], where his doctoral supervisor was the late social statistician Cathie Marsh.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=2983365|title=Obituary: Professor Catherine Marsh, 1952–93|first=Angela|last=Dale|authorlink=Angela Dale|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]]|volume=157|issue=2|year=1994|pages=301–302|publisher=[[Blackwell publishing]]|doi=10.1111/j.1467-985X.1994.tb00571.x|doi-access=free}}</ref> He was first junior and then senior research fellow at [[King's College, Cambridge]], from 1984 to 1991. From 1995 until 2003 he was reader in sociology at the [[University of Oxford]] and fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]]. In 2002, he was awarded a [[title of distinction]] as professor of sociology and in 2003 he became an official fellow of Nuffield College. In 2000 he was elected a fellow of the [[British Academy]].<ref name="eas">[http://www.europeanacademy.nl/fellows_list.htm Diego Gambetta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321051808/http://www.europeanacademy.nl/fellows_list.htm |date=21 March 2009 }} European Academy of Sociology</ref><ref>[http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/archive.asp?fellowsID=1318 British Academy Fellows Archive.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606070818/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/archive.asp?fellowsID=1318 |date=6 June 2011 }} [[British Academy]].

==Analysis==
In his book "The Sicilian Mafia: The Business of Private Protection" (published by Harvard University Press in 1993), he brings a new perspective on an extralegal institution like the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] by underscoring the market demand for protection that it satisfies and by showing how mafiosi apparently outlandish rituals and behaviours make organisational sense. His approach has had much influence on the study of mafia-like organisations around the world – it has been applied to cases in Russia,<ref>Varese. F. 2001. The Russian Mafia. Private Protection in a New Market Economy. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.</ref> Hong Kong,<ref>Chu, Yiu Kong (2000) The Triads as Business. London and New York: Routledge.</ref> Japan <ref>{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Peter E|title=The Japanese mafia: yakuza, law, and the state|year=2003|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press}}</ref> Bulgaria<ref>Marina Tzvetkova, Aspects of the evolution of extra-legal protection in Bulgaria (1989–1999), Trends in Organized Crime, Springer, New York</ref> and Mainland China<ref>{{cite book|last=Wang|first=Peng|title=The Chinese mafia: organized crime, corruption, and extra-legal protection|year=2017|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press}}</ref> – and more generally on the study of extra-legal governance<ref>Dixit, A. (2004). Lawlessness and Economics: Alternative Modes of Economic Governance. Gorman Lectures. Princeton University Press.</ref> as well as Mafia Transplantation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Varese|first=Federico|title=Mafias on the Move: How Organized Crime Conquers New Territories|url=https://archive.org/details/mafiasonmovehowo00vare|url-access=registration|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>

Gambetta has a long lasting interest in trust. In 1987, when the concept was largely ignored in the social sciences, he published a groundbreaking edited collection, with authors from all quarters of the social sciences ("Trust. Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations"). His subsequent work in this area, with the late economist Michael Bacharach,<ref name="The Guardian 2002">{{cite web | title=Obituary: Michael Bacharach | website=The Guardian | date=2002-09-17 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/17/guardianobituaries.obituaries | access-date=2017-08-10}}</ref> employs [[game theory]] to provide a rigorous definition of trust, and [[signalling theory]] to understand the nature of trust decisions. This work describes at once how trust can be threatened by "mimics" of signals of trustworthiness, and the general conditions under which signals of trustworthiness can be relied upon.<ref>[[Michael Spence]], The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 87, No. 3 (Aug. 1973), pp. 355–374 [1]</ref> Signalling theory, which emerged simultaneously in economics and biology in the early 1970s –asserts that the reliability of signals, in social interactions among humans and other animals, depends on whether the signals are supported by behaviour that would be too costly for (most) mimics to afford, while being affordable by genuine signallers.

After an imaginative application of the theory to how taxi drivers in dangerous cities decide whether to take on board hailers and callers<ref>Gambetta, D., & Hamill, H. (2005). Streetwise. How taxi drivers establish their customers' trustworthiness. New York: Russel Sage</ref> on the basis of little information, Gambetta's recent major work, “Codes of the Underworld. How Criminals Communicate” (published by Princeton University Press in 2009), applies signalling theory to analyse how credibility of communication is established in a world where trust is under multiple threats. [[Thomas Schelling]], the Nobel Prize–winning economist, among the first and few to write on the economics of organised crime, wrote that the book "illuminates a vast field of strategic communication where trust cannot be taken for granted. There is nothing comparable in print, and the book's interpretations will carry well beyond the field of conventional crime."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/quotes/q9010.html|title=Additional Reviews and/or Endorsements for Gambetta, D.: Codes of the Underworld: How Criminals Communicate.|website=press.princeton.edu}}</ref> The book, listed by New Scientist as one of The best books of 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2009/12/the-best-books-of-2009.php|title=CultureLab: The best books of 2009|website=www.newscientist.com}}</ref> has been described by one reviewer as the product of a “brilliant economic naturalist.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stevereads.com/2010/01/22/way-behind-on-book-reviews-here-are-some-capsules/|title=Way behind on book reviews; here are some capsules|last=stevereads|date=23 January 2010|publisher=}}</ref>

Gambetta's work has, in recent years, extended to examining violent extremists. A number of Gambetta's research questions have come from "puzzles", unexpected or counter-intuitive correlations, such as the presence of a large proportion of engineers among Islamic radicals. In 2005 he edited “Making Sense of Suicide Missions” (published by Oxford University Press), and he is now working with Steffen Hertog on a book on “Engineers of Jihad” for Princeton University Press.<ref>“Why are there so many Engineers among Islamic Radicals?” Archives Européennes de Sociologie, L (2), 201–230</ref>

In terms of direct intellectual influences on Gambetta's work, in addition to Thomas Schelling, one may count Michael Bacharach, Partha Dasgupta, Jon Elster and Bernard Williams.
