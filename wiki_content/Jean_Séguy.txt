Influenced by the work of [[Max Weber]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]], he was particularly interested in [[cult]]s, religious conflicts and [[Christianity]] (especially [[Protestantism]] and its [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] sects, [[Seventh-day Adventism]]). In 1977, he was the author of a notable thesis on the [[Anabaptist]]s and [[Mennonite]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regard sur Jean Séguy — Un sociologue du non-conformisme religieux chrétien |url=http://blogdesebastienfath.hautetfort.com/media/02/01/148616280.pdf |publisher=[[Sébastien Fath]] |date=12 December 2008 |language=French |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref> He was also member of the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean Séguy |url=http://www.universalis.fr/corpus_auteur-encyclopedie/121/87/encyclopedie/Jean_SEGUY.htm |publisher=Universalis |accessdate=2009-07-14 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619102821/http://www.universalis.fr/corpus_auteur-encyclopedie/121/87/encyclopedie/Jean_SEGUY.htm |archivedate=June 19, 2009 }}</ref> He served as editor-in-chief of the journal ''Archives de sciences sociales des religions'' between 1980 and 1988.<ref>Hervieu-Léger (2008), 156.</ref> He died in [[Liancourt]], [[Oise]], aged 82.
