== Early life ==
Keohane was born at the [[University of Chicago Hospitals]]. His education through the fifth grade was at the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]]. When he was 10, the family moved to [[Mount Carroll, Illinois]], where he attended public school and his parents taught at [[Shimer College]].  After the 10th grade, Keohane enrolled at Shimer through the school's early entrance program, which since 1950 has allowed selected high school students to enter college before completing high school.<ref name="early_entrance">{{cite web|url=http://www.shimer.edu/academicprograms/undergraduate/earlyentrantprogram.cfm|title=Early Entrance Program|author=Shimer College|access-date=2012-04-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602055849/http://shimer.edu/academicprograms/undergraduate/earlyentrantprogram.cfm|archive-date=2013-06-02}}</ref>  When later asked to compare his undergraduate education as an early entrant at Shimer with his graduate work at Harvard, Keohane remarked "it is not clear to me that I have ever been with a brighter set of people than those early entrants."<ref name="alumni_profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.shimer.edu/alumninetwork/RobertKeohane.cfm|title=Alumni Profiles: Robert Keohane|work=Shimer.edu|author=Shimer College|access-date=2012-04-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301205342/http://www.shimer.edu/alumninetwork/RobertKeohane.cfm|archive-date=2012-03-01}}</ref> Keohane currently serves on the Board of Trustees of Shimer College.

He earned a BA, with honors, from [[Shimer College]] in 1961.<ref name="alumni_profile"/> He obtained his PhD from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1966, one year after he joined the faculty of [[Swarthmore College]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Keohane|first=Robert O.|date=2020|title=Understanding Multilateral Institutions in Easy and Hard Times|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=23|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050918-042625|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref> He was the student of Harvard University Professor [[Stanley Hoffmann]]. He described [[Judith N. Shklar|Judith Shklar]] as his strongest intellectual mentor during his graduate studies.<ref name=":1" /> He has also described Kenneth Waltz and Karl Polanyi as influences.<ref name=":02" />

== Career ==
Keohane has taught at [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and [[Duke University|Duke]]. At Harvard he was Stanfield Professor of International Peace, and at Duke he was the [[James B. Duke Professor]] of Political Science.

He is the author of many works, including [[After Hegemony|''After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy'']] (Princeton University Press, 1984), for which he was awarded the second annual [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in 1989 for "Ideas Improving World Order".<ref name="grawemeyer.org">{{cite web|title=1989- Robert Keohane|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1989-robert-keohane.html|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610230131/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1989-robert-keohane.html|archive-date=2015-06-10}}</ref> Keohane describes the process of forming the theoretical insights of ''After Hegemony'' as follows during the late 1970s,<blockquote>In a world of structural Realism and hegemony, the institutionalized policy coordination that we were increasingly observing in the late 1970s seemed an anomaly. How could it emerge consistent with the theory, or was something missing in the theory itself? Was leadership by a single state, based on dominance or hegemony, essential for cooperation? I did not understand the puzzle clearly, much less have an answer, until I attended a meeting at the University of Minnesota, organized by the economist Anne Krueger and sponsored by the National Science Foundation, at which [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] spoke about the implications for international relations of “[[Transaction cost|transactions costs]],” risk, and uncertainty. I had not even heard of transaction costs before this time, but when I returned to Stanford I began thinking about these issues, aided by friends and colleagues who knew about “the [[New institutional economics|new economics of organization]]”... I can still remember the “aha” feeling that I had in December 1979, in my Stanford office, looking over the campus, when I recognized the significance of these theories for the understanding of international cooperation.<ref name=":02"/></blockquote>Keohane has been characterized as a key figure in the development of a discipline of [[International political economy|International Political Economy]] in the United States.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=16–17, 23–29|language=en}}</ref> Along with Joseph Nye, Keohane coined the concept of [[complex interdependence]] to capture the ways in which power had been fragmented and diffused in economic affairs.<ref name=":1" /> Robert Keohane coined the term [[Hegemonic stability theory]] in a 1980 article for the notion that the international system is more likely to remain stable when a single [[nation-state]] is the dominant world power, or [[hegemon]].<ref name=":923">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=66–68|language=en}}</ref> Keohane's 1984 book ''[[After Hegemony]]'' used insights from the [[new institutional economics]] to argue that the international system could remain stable in the absence of a hegemon, thus rebutting hegemonic stability theory.<ref name=":02"/> Keohane showed that international cooperation could be sustained through repeated interactions, transparency, and monitoring.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norrlof|first=Carla|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/americas-global-advantage/29F591B11AD3CCFDA25F7ED7D9191B55|title=America's Global Advantage: US Hegemony and International Cooperation|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76543-5|pages=30–31|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511676406}}</ref>

Keohane played an important role in steering the focus of the journal ''[[International Organization]]'' from scholarship focused on international organizations to a general IR journal; it is now the leading journal in the field of IR.<ref name=":92">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=35–36|language=en}}</ref> He joined the journal in 1968.<ref name=":92" /> Between 1974 and 1980, he was editor of the journal.<ref name=":92" />
