==Research==

===Self-verification theory===
Swann devised [[self-verification theory]],<ref name="JacksonII2010">{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Ronald L.|title=Encyclopedia of Identity|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98R8WNco86EC&pg=PA367|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=29 June 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-5153-1|page=367|chapter=Self-Enhancement Theory}}</ref> which focuses on people’s desire to be known and understood by others. Once people develop firmly held beliefs about themselves, the theory suggests that they will come to prefer that others see them as they see themselves—even if their self-views are negative. Swann and his colleagues have found this tendency in many experiments.<ref name="KassinFein2010">{{cite book|last1=Kassin|first1=Saul|last2=Fein|first2=Steven|last3=Markus|first3=Hazel Rose|title=Social Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aCdjhGxDjgC&pg=PA92|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=29 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-81240-1|page=92}}</ref><ref name="HaufFörsterling2007">{{cite book|last1=Hauf|first1=Petra|last2=Försterling|first2=Friedrich|title=Making minds: the shaping of human minds through social context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h0coOMhj2IC&pg=PA69|accessdate=22 March 2011|year=2007|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-2234-3|page=69}}</ref> For example, married people with negative self-views are more committed to the relationship and less likely to divorce if their spouse views them negatively.<ref name="LearyTangney2005">{{cite book|last1=Swann|first1=William B.|last2=Rentfrow|first2=Peter J.|last3=Guinn|first3=Jennifer S.|editor=Mark R.

There is a tension between ''[[self-enhancement]]'' (the drive for a positive self-image) and self-verification, which reinforces even the negative aspects of a self-image. Swann and colleagues have found that emotional reactions favor enhancement, while more thoughtful processes favor verification.<ref name="SorrentinoYamaguchi2008" /><ref name="KwangSwann2010">{{cite journal|last1=Kwang|first1=T.|last2=Swann|first2=W.

===Identity negotiation===
More recently Swann has contributed to [[identity negotiation]] theory. ''Identity negotiation'' refers to the processes whereby people in relationships reach agreements regarding "who is who." Once reached, these agreements govern what people expect of one another and the way they relate to one another. As such, identity negotiation processes provide the interpersonal "glue" that holds relationships together.<ref name="Swann1987">{{cite journal|last1=Swann|first1=William B.|title=Identity negotiation: Where two roads meet|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=53|issue=6|year=1987|pages=1038–1051|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.6.1038|pmid=3320335|citeseerx=10.1.1.323.4130}}</ref> Identity negotiation theory has been used to examine how people work or study together in groups, especially the role of diversity.<ref name="Swann1987" />

=== Identity fusion ===
[[Identity fusion]] is a visceral sense of “oneness” with a group and its individual members that motivates personally costly, pro-group behaviors.<ref name="SwannGómez2009" /><ref name="Swann 2012">{{cite journal|last1=Swann|first1=W.B.|last2=Jetten|first2=J.|last3=Gomez|first3=A.|last4=Whitehouse|first4=H.|last5=Bastian|first5=B|title=When group membership gets personal: A theory of identity fusion.|journal=Psychological Review|date=2012|volume=119|issue=3|pages=441–456|doi=10.1037/a0028589|pmid=22642548}}</ref> Past approaches, most notably social identity theory, have assumed that when people align with groups they are bound to the group by collective ties to the group category.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tajfel|first1=H.|last2=Turner|first2=J.C.|editor1-last=William|editor1-first=G.A.|title=The social psychology of intergroup relations|date=1979|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Monterey, CA|isbn=978-0818502781|pages=33–47|chapter=An integrative theory of intergroup conflict.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=J.C.|last2=Hogg|first2=M.A.|last3=Oakes|first3=P.J.|last4=Reicher|first4=S.D.|last5=Wetherell|first5=M.S.|title=Rediscovering the social group: self-categorization theory|date=1987|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780631148067}}</ref> Fusion theory emphasizes the ways in which alignment to groups can be based on fit with the personal self and attachment to other group members. Strongly fused persons are especially inclined to endorse pro-group action when either the personal or the social self is salient, when physiological arousal is high, or when they perceive that group members share essential qualities (e.g., genes, core values) with one another.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Swann|first1=W.B.|last2=Gomez|first2=A|last3=Dovidio|first3=J.F.|last4=Hart|first4=S|last5=Jetten|first5=J.|title=Dying and Killing for One's Group|journal=Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=21|issue=8|pages=1176–1183|doi=10.1177/0956797610376656|pmid=20622141|s2cid=16751081}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Swann|first1=W.B.|last2=Buhrmester|first2=M.D.|last3=Gomez|first3=A|last4=Jetten|first4=J|last5=Bastian|first5=B|last6=Vazquez|first6=A|last7=Ariyanto|first7=A|last8=Besta|first8=T|last9=Christ|first9=O|title=What makes a group worth dying for?

All of these effects emerge while controlling for identification, which predicted extreme sacrifice for the group weakly if at all. Moreover, identity fusion is associated with actual extreme behaviors, such as willingness to volunteer for front-line duty among Libyans during the 2011 revolution.<ref name="Whitehouse 2014">{{cite journal|last1=Whitehouse|first1=H.|last2=McQuinn|first2=B.|last3=Buhrmester|first3=M.D.|last4=Swann|first4=W.B.|title=Brothers in arms: Libyan revolutionaries bond like family|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2014|volume=111|issue=20|pages=17783–17785|doi=10.1073/pnas.1416284111|pmid=25385591|pmc=4273349|doi-access=free}}</ref> By specifying some of the key antecedents of extreme pro-group behavior as well as the role of the personal self and relational, family like ties in such behavior, the identity-fusion approach fills an important explanatory gap left largely unaddressed by earlier perspectives on group processes.
