'''Cheri Jo Pascoe''' (born June 3, 1974) is an [[United States|American]] [[sociologist]] and author. She is currently an associate professor at the [[University of Oregon]]. Her research focuses on [[gender]], youth, [[homophobia]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and news media.

==Early life and education==
Pascoe was born in [[Seattle, Washington]] and raised in [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]], California. She has one younger brother.

She received her undergraduate degree from [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], Massachusetts. After college she coordinated an eating disorder program in [[Boston]]. She then received her PhD in Sociology from [[University of California at Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]]. She was drawn to Berkeley because of their strong [[gender studies]] program, and attended from 1997 to 2007.<ref>Personal Interview February 26, 2010</ref>

==Academic career==
Pascoe started her career as a sociologist right out of graduate school, working as a consultant for the Digital Youth Project in California founded by [[The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]]. The Digital Youth Project, based out of UC Berkeley, studies how youth use new media and addresses three main objectives: “The first objective is to describe kids as active innovators using digital media rather than as passive consumers of popular culture or academic knowledge. The second objective is to think about the implications of kids' innovative cultures for schools and higher education and to engage in a dialogue with educational planners. The third objective is to advise software designers about how to use kids' innovative approaches to knowledge and learning in building better software.” <ref>ABOUT DIGITAL YOUTH | DIGITAL YOUTH RESEARCH." DIGITAL YOUTH RESEARCH | Kids' Informal Learning with Digital Media. Web. February 26, 2010</ref> While Pascoe was working with the Digital Youth Project, she studied teens and how they used new media. She found that they were mostly using forms of new media throughout their romantic and dating lives.

Pascoe is especially interested in how teenage boys think of themselves as masculine. She spent a year and a half following teenage boys in a high school in California and found that they prove their masculinity by calling each other negative homosexual slurs. She found that these teenage boys prove themselves by calling others unmasculine or "[[Faggot (slang)|fags]]" when they behave in unmasculine ways. “To call someone gay or fag is like the lowest thing you can call someone. Because that’s like saying that you’re nothing,” is how one teenage boy put it to Pascoe.<ref>Dude, Youve Got Problems – Opinionator Blog – NYTimes.com." Opinion – Opinionator Blog – NYTimes.com.</ref>

She has also been interested in the subculture of [[pro-ana]] websites create and how women with anorexia use the web as a way to connect and encourage anorexia and other eating disorders. “This is by all means not all anorexics; I wouldn't even say the majority of anorexics or people with eating disorders are in this kind of community. These are primarily women who set out to have an eating-disordered lifestyle. This is not a teenager who's gone on a diet and taken it too far and is getting help. There's a difference between those two things. These are, again, primarily women who take pride in their ability to deny themselves food and to keep their weight at this artificially low and dangerous level”.<ref>"FRONTLINE: growing up online: interviews: c.j. pascoe |." PBS. Web. February 20, 2010.</ref>

Pascoe's research has been featured in the ''New York Times'',<ref>Dude, Youve Got Problems – Opinionator Blog – NYTimes.com.</ref> ''The Wall Street Journal'',<ref>"Sexting, an Epidemic of Fuzzy Math – WSJ.com." Business News & Financial News – The Wall Street Journal – WSJ.com</ref> The ''Toronto Globe and Mail'', ''American Sexuality Magazine'' and ''Inside Higher Ed.''
