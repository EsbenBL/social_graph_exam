'''Horace Mitchell Miner''' (May 26, 1912 – November 26, 1993) was an American [[anthropologist]], particularly interested in those languages of his time that were still closely tied to the earth and agricultural practices. 

During [[World War II]], he served as a [[counterintelligence]] agent in [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. In 1955 [says 1937 below], he earned his doctorate at the [[University of Chicago]], going on to teach there, as well as at other universities in the United States, and on a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] at a college in [[Uganda]]. He later worked elsewhere in [[Africa]], and in [[South America]]. 

He published several books, including ''Culture and Agriculture'' (1949), and ''City in Modern Africa'' (1967). However, he is equally famous for a [[satirical]] [[essay]] entitled [[s:Body Ritual among the Nacirema|"Body Ritual among the Nacirema"]], which not only satirizes American culture from an anthropological perspective and, as the ''Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology'' states, "...offered incipient cultural critiques of Euro-American arrogance, by showing that magic is not the prerogative of non-Western societies,"<ref>"magic." Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology. London: Routledge, 2009. Credo Reference. Web. 24 September 2012.</ref> but also provides "a classic and apt example of how ethnocentrism can color one's thinking."<ref>Preston, Frederick William (1988) ''Sociology: A Contemporary Approach'' pg 73.</ref> 

The work was also featured in ''American Anthropologist.''<ref>{{cite journal|journal=American Anthropologist|date=28 Oct 2009|volume=58|issue=3|doi = 10.1525/aa.1956.58.3.02a00080|title=Body Ritual among the Nacirema|pages=503–507|last1=Miner|first1=Horace}}</ref>
