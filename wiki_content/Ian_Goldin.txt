From 1996 to 2001, Goldin was chief executive and managing director of the [[Development Bank of Southern Africa]] (DBSA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2013/12/06/business-leaders-pay-tribute-to-mandela|title=Business leaders pay tribute to Mandela|website=Business Day Live|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/developmentbankofsouthernafric/docs/the_evolution_of_the_dbsa_2010|title=The Evolution of the DBSA 2010|website=Issuu|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref> and at that time also served as an adviser to President [[Nelson Mandela]]. He succeeded in transforming the Bank from an apartheid-era institution to become the leading agent of development in the 14 countries of Southern Africa. During this period, Goldin served on several government committees and boards, and was finance director for South Africa's Olympic Games bid.

Goldin was director of development policy at the [[World Bank]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/world-bank-global-practices-knowledge-sharing-made-easier-87481|title=World Bank Global Practices — knowledge sharing made easier? {{!}} Devex|website=www.devex.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref> (2001–2003) and then vice president of the World Bank (2003–2006). He served on the Bank's senior management team, and was directly responsible for its relationship with the UK and all other European, [[North American]] and developed countries. Goldin led the Bank's collaboration with the [[United Nations]] and other partners. As Director of Development Policy, Goldin played a central role in the research and strategy agenda of the Bank, working closely with the [[Chief Economist]], [[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Lord Nicholas Stern]], under the leadership of [[James Wolfensohn]]. During this period, Goldin was special representative at the United Nations and served on the chief executive board of the UN and the UN Reform Task Force.

In 2006, Goldin became founding director of the [[Oxford Martin School]]. Under his leadership, the school established 45 programmes of research, bringing together more than 500 academics from over 100 disciplines,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/reports/ideas_into_action.pdf |title= Ideas Into Action - Oxford Martin School 10th Anniversary Report |website=Oxford Martin School|access-date=2016-09-23}}</ref> and becoming the world's leading centre for interdisciplinary research into critical global challenges. He remained the School's director until September 2016 when [[Achim Steiner]] followed him in this position.

Goldin initiated and was vice-chair of the Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/commission/Oxford_Martin_Now_for_the_Long_Term.pdf |title= Now for the Long Term |website=Oxford Martin School|access-date=2016-09-23}}</ref> which brought together international leaders from government, business, academia, media and civil society to address the growing short-term preoccupations of modern politics and business, and identify ways of overcoming today's gridlock in key international negotiations. Chaired by [[Pascal Lamy]], the Commission published its findings in October 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/68779e4e-364f-11e3-aaf1-00144feab7de.html#axzz46SWtyJyT|title=Global institutions need revamp, Oxford Martin Commission warns|last=Donnan|first=Shawn|date=2013-10-16|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/10381558/Short-termism-in-business-can-perpetuate-instability-and-risk.html|title=Short-termism in business can perpetuate instability and risk|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/think-long-term-to-address-worlds-biggest-problems-report-19271|title=Think long term to address world's biggest problems: report|website=The Conversation|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/07/why-politicians-need-historians|title=Why politicians need historians|date=2014-10-07|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/report-business-responsibility-long-term|title=Report calls on business to take responsibility and think long-term|last=Goldin|first=Ian|date=2013-10-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref>
