It is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity" and has one of the largest university libraries in the world.<ref name=":54" />

Princeton uses a [[residential college]] system and is known for its upperclassmen [[Eating clubs at Princeton University|eating clubs]]. The university has over 500 student organizations. Princeton students embrace a wide variety of traditions from both the past and present. The university is a [[NCAA Division I]] school and competes in the Ivy League. The school's athletic team, the [[Princeton Tigers]], has won the most titles in its conference and has sent many students and alumni to the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]].

As of October 2021, 74 Nobel laureates, 16 Fields Medalists and 16 Turing Award laureates have been affiliated with Princeton University as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.

=== Founding ===
[[File:Log College.jpg|thumb|The [[Log College]], an influential aspect of Princeton's development|alt=A drawing of the Log College|upright=1.1]]
Princeton University, founded as the College of New Jersey, was shaped much in its formative years by the "[[Log College]]", a [[seminary]] founded by the Reverend [[William Tennent]] at [[Neshaminy, Pennsylvania]] in about 1726. While no legal connection ever existed, many of the pupils and adherents from the Log College would go on to financially support and become substantially involved in the early years of the university.{{Sfn|Leitch|1978|p=291–292}} While early writers considered it as the predecessor of the university,<ref name=":510">{{Cite journal|date=March 1877|editor-last=Holland|editor-first=J.

The founding of the university itself originated from a split in the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church following the [[Great Awakening]].{{Sfn|Oberdorfer|1995|p=11}} In 1741, [[Old Side–New Side Controversy|New Light]] Presbyterians were expelled from the [[Synod of Philadelphia]] in defense of how the Log College ordained ministers.{{Sfn|Leitch|1978|p=198}} The four founders of Princeton, who were New Lights, were either expelled or withdrew from the Synod and devised a plan to establish a new college, for they were disappointed with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]]'s opposition to the Great Awakening and dissatisfied with the limited instruction at the Log College.{{Sfn|Leitch|1978|p=198}}{{Sfn|Oberdorfer|1995|p=11}} They convinced three other Presbyterians to join them and decided on New Jersey for where to found the school, as at the time, there was no institution between Yale in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and the [[College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]; it was also where some of the founders preached.{{Sfn|Oberdorfer|1995|p=12}} Although their initial request was rejected by the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] governor, [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Lewis Morrison]], the [[acting governor]] after Morrison's death, [[John Hamilton (New Jersey politician)|John Hamilton]], granted a charter for the College of New Jersey on October 22, 1746.{{Sfn|Leitch|1978|p=199}}{{Sfn|Oberdorfer|1995|p=12}} In 1747, approximately five months after acquiring the charter, the trustees elected [[Jonathan Dickinson (New Jersey minister)|Jonathan Dickinson]] as president and opened in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]],{{Sfn|Leitch|1978|p=199}} where classes were held in Dickinson's residence.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jonathan Dickinson|url=https://pr.princeton.edu/pub/presidents/dickinson/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709183254/https://pr.princeton.edu/pub/presidents/dickinson/index.html|archive-date=July 9, 2021|access-date=2021-07-04|website=The Presidents of Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref> With its founding, it became the [[Colonial colleges|fourth-oldest institution]] of higher education in the United States, and one of nine colonial colleges charted before the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":34" /> Although initially founded with the goal to train ministers, the founders instead aimed to create a college of liberal arts and sciences.{{Sfn|Morrison|2005|p=47}}{{Sfn|Leitch|1978|p=199}} Though the school was open to those of any religious denomination,{{Sfn|Oberdorfer|1995|p=15}} with many of the founders being of Presbyterian faith, the college became the educational and religious capital of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] Presbyterian America.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wertenbaker|first=Thomas J.|date=December 1958|title=The College of New Jersey and the Presbyterians|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23325333|journal=Journal of the Presbyterian Historical Society|volume=36|issue=4|pages=213|jstor=23325333|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

==== Coeducation ====
History of coeducation at the university dates back to the 19th century. Founded in 1887, the [[Evelyn College for Women]] in Princeton provided education to largely the daughters of professors and sisters of Princeton undergraduates. While no legal connection ever existed, many Princeton professors taught there and several Princeton administrations, like Francis Patton, were part of its board of trustees. It closed in 1897 following the death of its founder, [[Joshua Hall McIlvaine|Joshua McIlvaine]].{{Sfn|Leitch|1978|p=170–171}}

Though art collection at the university dates back to its very founding, the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] wasn't officially established until 1882 by President McCosh.

"[[Old Nassau]]" has been Princeton University's school song since 1859, when it was written that year by freshman Harlan Page Peck. It was originally published in the ''Nassau Literary Magazine'', where it won the magazine's prize for best college song. After an unsuccessful attempt at singing it to [[Auld Lang Syne|''Auld Lang Syne'']]'s melody, Karl Langlotz, a Princeton professor, wrote the music for it.<ref>{{Cite web|title='Old Nassau'|url=https://princetoniana.princeton.edu/traditions/performing-arts/songs/old-nassau|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210601185451/https://princetoniana.princeton.edu/traditions/performing-arts/songs/old-nassau|archive-date=June 1, 2021|access-date=2021-07-08|website=Princetoniana|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>  In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of "Old Nassau" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=1987-03-01|title=Princeton Song Goes Coed|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/nyregion/princeton-song-goes-coed.html|access-date=2021-06-18|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

This decline prompted ''The Daily Princetonian'' to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote that Princeton was "long dogged by a reputation for [[anti-Semitism]]" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students.

In the fall, freshman and sophomores participate in the intramural athletic competition called [[Cane Spree]]. Although the event centers on cane wrestling, freshman and sophomores compete in other sports and competitions. This commemorates a time in the 1870s when sophomores, angry with the freshmen who strutted around with fancy canes, stole all of the canes from the freshmen, hitting them with their own canes in the process.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cane Spree|url=https://princetoniana.princeton.edu/traditions/current/cane-spree|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121213955/https://princetoniana.princeton.edu/traditions/current/cane-spree|archive-date=January 21, 2021|access-date=2021-06-22|website=Princetoniana|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>
