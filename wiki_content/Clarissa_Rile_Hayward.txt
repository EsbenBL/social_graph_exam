'''Clarissa Rile Hayward''' is an [[America]]n [[political scientist]] and [[political philosopher]], currently a professor in political science at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] with affiliations in [[cultural studies|American culture studies]], [[urban studies]], and [[philosophy]]. Hayward studies the theory of political power, how political phenomena relate to theories of identity, and urban politics in the United States.

==Early career and education==
Hayward obtained a BA in politics from [[Princeton University]] in 1988, both an MA and an MPhil from [[Yale University]] in 1994, and a PhD from Yale University in 1998.<ref name=profile>{{cite web |url=https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/clarissa-rile-hayward |title=Clarissa Rile Hayward Profile |publisher=Washington University in St. Louis Arts and Science Faculty |access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> In 1999, she became a professor at the [[Ohio State University]], before moving to Washington University in St. Louis in 2007.<ref name=profile/>

==Career==
Hayward published her first book, ''De-facing power'', in 2000. The book argues that the main conceptions of power in political theory assume that it necessarily consists of one group or individual reducing the capacity of others to act freely, so that it has a sort of "face" by which it can be identified.<ref name=topper04>{{cite journal |last=Topper |first=Keith |title=Review of De-facing power |journal=Journal of Politics |volume=66 |number=4 |pages=1336–1339 |date=November 2004|doi=10.1017/S0022381600004400 }}</ref> The book challenges this [[negative liberty]] idea of power as a state of domination by one person over another.<ref name=topper04/> Instead, Hayward builds on the [[post-structuralist]] work of [[Michel Foucault]] to argue that social power should be understood as a set or network of boundaries—consisting of patterns like laws, norms, and institutions—which can either constrain or enable action.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Digeser |first=P.E. |title=Review of De-facing power |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=96 |number=3 |pages=614 |date=September 2002|doi=10.1017/S0003055402260360 }}</ref>

Hayward's second book, ''How Americans Make Race: Stories, Institutions, Spaces'', was published in 2013. The book is partly motivated by a paradox in American racial inequality: how to reconcile the empirical reality of racial inequality with the pervasive norms against racism, and more broadly how to explain the tangible material consequences of identities if we understand identities only as cultural narratives that people associate themselves with.<ref name=lebron15>{{cite journal |last=Lebron |first=Christopher J. |title=Review of How Americans make race: Stories, institutions and spaces |journal=Contemporary Political Theory |volume=14 |number=2 |date=April 2015 |pages=201–204 |doi=10.1057/cpt.2014.17|doi-access=free }}</ref> Hayward uses the case of residential real estate to illustrate how apparently non-political motivations for this ubiquitous behavior, such as a desire for comfort and security, have origins in stories about racial identity that American culture has historically relied on to ensure that racial categories have material consequences, through tools like neighborhood segregation and the development of exclusive suburbs.<ref name=lebron15/> These ideas, which have shaped peoples' relationships to physical space, were explicitly rationalized by politicians and developers as those spaces were being developed, and these rationalizations were based on racial identities.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Autry |first=Robyn |title=Review of How Americans make race: Stories, institutions and spaces |journal=Contemporary Sociology |volume=44 |number=6 |date=November 2015 |pages=808–810 |doi=10.1177/0094306115609925t}}</ref> This book won the Urban Politics Section of the [[American Political Science Association]]'s best book award for 2013.<ref name=apsaaward>{{cite web |url=https://connect.apsanet.org/s13/dennis-judd-best-book-award/ |title=Dennis Judd Best Book Award |publisher=American Political Science Association |year=2014 |access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>
