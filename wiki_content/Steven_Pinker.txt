Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at [[Harvard University]], and his academic specializations are [[Perception|visual cognition]] and [[developmental linguistics]]. His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and [[grammar]], as well as the psychology of cooperation and communication, including [[euphemism]], [[innuendo]], emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of [[language acquisition]] and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with [[Alan Prince]] published in 1989 critiqued the [[connectionist]] model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, positing that children use default rules, such as adding ''-ed'' to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.

Pinker is also the author of eight books for general audiences. ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' (1994), ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997), ''[[Words and Rules]]'' (2000), ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007) describe aspects of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research, positing that language is an innate behavior shaped by [[natural selection]] and [[Adaptation|adapted]] to our communication needs. Pinker's ''[[The Sense of Style]]'' (2014) is a general language-oriented [[style guide]].<ref name="RgfOf">The Sense of Style</ref> Pinker's book ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'' (2011) posits that violence in human societies has generally steadily declined over time, and identifies six major trends and five historical forces of this decline. ''[[Enlightenment Now]]'' (2018) uses social science data to show a general improvement of the human condition over recent history.

In 2004, Pinker was named in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s "The 100 Most Influential People in the World Today", and in the years 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2011 in ''[[Foreign Policy]]''{{'}}s list of "Top 100 Global Thinkers".<ref name="ojMWA">{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1970858_1970909_1971671,00.html|title=The 2004 Time 100|first=Robert|last=Wright|date=April 26, 2004|magazine=Time}}</ref> Pinker was also included in Prospect Magazine's top 10 "World Thinkers" in 2013.<ref name="jyYbj">{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/world-thinkers-2013|title=World Thinkers 2013}}</ref> He has won awards from the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain|Royal Institution]], the [[Cognitive Neuroscience Society]], and the [[American Humanist Association]].<ref name="hJbcz">{{Cite web|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-12369-001|title=APA PsycNet|website=psycnet.apa.org}}</ref><ref name="woHAD">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/20038978.html|title=Steven Pinker|website=www.nasonline.org}}</ref><ref name="qrrWj">{{Cite web|url=https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/humanist-of-the-year-awards/|title=Humanist of the Year Award|website=American Humanist Association}}</ref><ref name="4lImB">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cogneurosociety.org/george-a-miller-award/|title=George A.

==Linguistic career==

Pinker's research on visual cognition, begun in collaboration with his thesis adviser, Stephen Kosslyn, showed that mental images represent scenes and objects as they appear from a specific vantage point (rather than capturing their intrinsic three-dimensional structure), and thus correspond to the neuroscientist [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]]'s theory of a "two-and-a-half-dimensional sketch."<ref name="GjI4r">The nature of the language faculty and its implications for evolution of language</ref>  He also showed that this level of representation is used in visual attention, and in [[object recognition]] (at least for asymmetrical shapes), contrary to Marr's theory that recognition uses viewpoint-independent representations.

In psycholinguistics, Pinker became known early in his career for promoting [[computational learning theory]] as a way to understand [[language acquisition]] in children. He wrote a tutorial review of the field followed by two books that advanced his own theory of language acquisition, and a series of experiments on how children acquire the passive, dative, and locative constructions. These books were ''Language Learnability and Language Development'' (1984), in Pinker's words "outlin[ing] a theory of how children acquire the words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue",<ref name="LongBiog">{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html | title=Steven Pinker: Long Biography | publisher=Harvard University | access-date=May 18, 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051229054325/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html | archive-date=December 29, 2005}}</ref> and ''Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure'' (1989), in Pinker's words "focus[ing] on one aspect of this process, the ability to use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different combinations of complements and indirect objects".<ref name="LongBiog" /> He then focused on verbs of two kinds that illustrate what he considers to be the processes required for human language: retrieving whole words from memory, like the past form of the [[Regular and irregular verbs|irregular verb]]<ref name="YxzxZ">Pinker has written a piece on [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html The Irregular Verbs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606015902/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html |date=June 6, 2014}}, stating that "I like the Irregular verbs of English, all 180 of them, because of what they tell us about the history of the language and the human minds that have perpetuated it.</ref> "bring", namely "brought"; and using rules to combine (parts of) words, like the past form of the regular verb "walk", namely "walked".<ref name="LongBiog" />

In 1988 Pinker and [[Alan Prince]] published a critique of a [[connectionist]] model of the acquisition of the past tense (a textbook problem in language acquisition), followed by a series of studies of how people use and acquire the past tense. This included a monograph on children's [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of irregular forms and his popular 1999 book, ''[[Words and Rules|Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language]]''. Pinker argued that language depends on two things, the associative remembering of sounds and their meanings in words, and the use of rules to manipulate symbols for [[grammar]]. He presented evidence against connectionism, where a child would have to learn all forms of all words and would simply retrieve each needed form from memory, in favour of the older alternative theory, the use of words and rules combined by [[generative phonology]]. He showed that mistakes made by children indicate the use of default rules to add suffixes such as "-ed": for instance 'breaked' and 'comed' for 'broke' and 'came'. He argued that this shows that irregular verb-forms in English have to be learnt and retrieved from memory individually, and that the children making these errors were predicting the regular "-ed" ending in an open-ended way by applying a mental rule. This rule for combining verb stems and the usual suffix can be expressed as<ref name="WRessay">{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Edinburgh.pdf | title=Words and rules (essay) | publisher=Harvard University | access-date=May 24, 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830145603/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Edinburgh.pdf | archive-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref> V<sub>past</sub> → V<sub>stem</sub> + d, where V is a verb and d is the regular ending. Pinker further argued that since the ten most frequently occurring English verbs (be, have, do, say, make ... ) are all irregular, while 98.2% of the thousand least common verbs are regular, there is a "massive correlation" of frequency and irregularity. He explains this by arguing that every irregular form, such as 'took', 'came' and 'got', has to be committed to memory by the children in each generation, or else lost, and that the common forms are the most easily memorized. Any irregular verb that falls in popularity past a certain point is lost, and all future generations will treat it as a regular verb instead.<ref name="WRessay" />

In 1990, Pinker, with [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]], published a paper arguing that the human language faculty must have evolved through [[natural selection]].<ref name="vmLIS">Pinker,&nbsp;S. & Bloom, P. (1990). Natural language and natural selection.

<!--[[File:AmericanBeaver.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Pinker argues that the human faculty for [[language]] is as much an instinct as a [[beaver]]'s ability to build dams.]]-->
Pinker's 1994 ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' was the first of several books to combine [[cognitive science]] with [[behavioral genetics]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. It introduces the science of language and popularizes [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's [[grammar]] is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that [[Great Ape language|other great apes can learn languages]]. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an [[instinct]] as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a [[spider]]'s web-weaving or a [[beaver]]'s dam-building.

Pinker states in his introduction that his ideas are "deeply influenced"<ref name="LIintro" /> by Chomsky; he also lists scientists whom Chomsky influenced to "open up whole new areas of language study, from child development and speech perception to neurology and genetics"<ref name="LIintro" /> — [[Eric Lenneberg]], [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], [[Roger William Brown|Roger Brown]], [[Morris Halle]] and [[Alvin Liberman]].<ref name="LIintro">{{cite book | title=The Language Instinct | publisher=Penguin | author=Pinker, Steven | year=1994 | pages=23–24}}</ref> Brown mentored Pinker through his thesis; Pinker stated that Brown's "funny and instructive"<ref name="BrownObit">{{cite journal | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Brown_obituary.pdf | title=Obituary: Roger Brown | author=Pinker, Steven | journal=Cognition | year=1998 | pages=199–213 (see page 205) | doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(98)00027-4 | volume=66 | issue=3 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518180224/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Brown_obituary.pdf | archive-date=May 18, 2015 | pmid=9689769 | s2cid=6858457}}</ref> book ''Words and Things'' (1958) was one of the inspirations for ''The Language Instinct''.<ref name="BrownObit" /><ref name="uNNJp">{{cite journal | url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/brown-roger-w.pdf | title=Roger William Brown 1925-1997 | author=Kagan, Jerome | journal=Biographical Memoirs | year=1999 | volume=77 | pages=7}}</ref>

There has been debate about the explanatory adequacy of the theory. By 2015, the [[Linguistic nativism|nativist]] views of Pinker and Chomsky had a number of challenges on the grounds that they had incorrect core assumptions and were inconsistent with research evidence from [[psycholinguistics]] and [[child language acquisition]].<ref name="rejection">* {{cite book | last1=Fernald | first1=Anne | title=Handbook of Psycholinguistics | last2=Marchman | first2=Virginia A. | date=2006| publisher=Academic Press | isbn=9780080466415 | editor-last=Traxler and Gernsbacher | pages=1027–1071 | chapter=27: Language learning in infancy}}, quote p. 1030: "Some critiques directly challenge the logic of arguments made by Chomsky, Pinker, and like-minded theorists, questioning such core assumptions as the universality of generative grammar, the autonomy of syntax in language processing, and the fundamental unlearnability of language (e.g., Bates & Goodman, 1999; Braine, 1994; Pullum & Scholz, 2002; Tomasello, 1995). Other critiques focus on empirical evidence inconsistent with particular nativist assertions. For example, the claim that negative evidence is not available when children make grammatical errors, an assumption central to the “poverty of the stimulus” argument at the heart of Chomsky’s theory, is not supported by a recent analysis of parents’ reformulations in speech to children (Chouinard & Clark, 2003). These diverse challenges, both philosophical and data-driven, have fueled debate over four decades about the explanatory adequacy of nativist theories of language learning." * {{cite book | last=de Bot | first=Kees | year=2015 | title=A History of Applied Linguistics: From 1980 to the Present | publisher=Routledge | isbn= 9781138820654}}, quote pp. 58–60: "GG is generally seen as a declining paradigm and its proponents now tend to stay away from conferences like AAAL (the American Association of Applied Linguistics) and University of Boston Child Language Development conferences, as a cursory count of papers on the basis of abstracts shows [...] In the psycholinguistic community, the idea of innateness and a Language Acquisition Device (LAD) were seen as problematic [...] Now that generation of GG linguists is retiring and there is a tendency in many universities not to replace them with younger scholars of that school, but rather appoint UB oriented linguists. There is almost a euphoria that the grip of the nativists on what constitutes linguistics is gone and that other approaches and more social orientations are seen as meaningful alternatives. Others try to explain the reasons for the decline of GG [...] Some informants are quite outspoken about the role of GG in AL. William Grabe states: “Fundamentally Chomsky is wrong and we wasted a lot of time. In 1964 Chomsky’s Aspects was published. Now, in 2014, we are 50 years later. What impact has all of that had in real world language use? This is an overstated theoretical direction.” Jan Hulstijn summarizes: “Generative linguistics has had no noticeable (or durable) impact.”"</ref> The reality of Pinker's proposed language instinct, and the related claim that grammar is innate and genetically based, has been contested by linguists such as [[Geoffrey Sampson]] in his 1997 book, ''[[Educating Eve|Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate]]' '.''<ref name="jcIP5">{{cite web|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/1449/|title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate|publisher=University of Sussex}}</ref><ref name="Sampson">{{cite web | url=http://www.grsampson.net/REmpNat.html | title=Empiricism v.

The assumptions underlying the [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] view have also been questioned in [[Jeffrey Elman]]'s ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]: A Connectionist Perspective on Development'', which defends the connectionist approach that Pinker attacked. In his 1996 book ''Impossible Minds'', the [[machine intelligence]] researcher [[Igor Aleksander]] calls ''The Language Instinct'' excellent, and argues that Pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism, accompanied by a strong dislike of the 'Standard Social Sciences Model' or SSSM (Pinker's term), which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture. Further, Aleksander writes that while Pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets, Pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly. Aleksander concludes that while he doesn't support the SSSM, "a cultural repository of language just seems the easy trick for an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic [[state machine]] to play."<ref name="Aleksander">{{cite book | title=Impossible Minds | author=Aleksander, Igor | year=1996 | pages=228–234 | isbn=1-86094-030-7}}</ref>

Two other books, ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), broadly surveyed the mind and defended the idea of a complex human nature with many mental faculties that are [[Genetics|genetically]] [[Adaptation|adaptive]] (Pinker is an ally of [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] in many disputes surrounding [[adaptationism]]). Another major theme in Pinker's theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models. On the debate around ''The Blank Slate'', Pinker called [[Thomas Sowell]]'s book ''[[A Conflict of Visions]]'' "wonderful",<ref name="Sailer">{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/media_articles/2002_10_30_upi.html | title=Q&A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate' | agency=United Press International | date=October 30, 2002 | access-date=May 10, 2014 | author=Sailer, Steve | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316221651/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/media_articles/2002_10_30_upi.html |archive-date=March 16, 2015}}</ref> and explained that "The Tragic Vision" and the "Utopian Vision" are the views of human nature behind [[right-wing|right-]] and left-wing ideologies.<ref name="Sailer" />

In ''[[Words and Rules|Words and Rules: the Ingredients of Language]]'' (1999), Pinker argues from his own research that regular and irregular phenomena are products of computation and memory lookup, respectively, and that language can be understood as an interaction between the two.<ref name="jjaWI">{{cite web|url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/wr/index.html |title=Words and Rules (book) |publisher=Harvard University |access-date=May 24, 2014 |author=Pinker, Steven |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330020838/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/wr/index.html |archive-date=March 30, 2014}}</ref> "Words and Rules" is also the title of an essay by Pinker outlining many of the topics discussed in the book.<ref name="WRessay" /> Critiqueing the book from the perspective of [[generative linguistics]] [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]], in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', writes that "this book never runs low on [[hubris]] or [[hyperbole]]".<ref name="LRB">{{cite journal | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n16/charles-yang/dig-dug-think-thunk | title=Dig-dug, think-thunk (review of ''Words and Rules'' by Steven Pinker) | author=Yang, Charles | journal=London Review of Books | date=August 24, 2000 | volume=22 | issue=6 | page=33}}</ref> The book's topic, the English past tense, is in Yang's view unglamorous, and Pinker's attempts at compromise risk being in no man's land between rival theories. Giving the example of German, Yang argues that irregular nouns in that language at least all belong to classes, governed by rules, and that things get even worse in languages that attach prefixes and suffixes to make up long 'words': they can't be learnt individually, as there are untold numbers of combinations. "All Pinker (and the connectionists) are doing is turning over the rocks at the base of the intellectual landslide caused by the Chomskian revolution."<ref name="LRB" />

In ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007), Pinker looks at a wide range of issues around the way words related to thoughts on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to [[Stone Age]] life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.<ref name="5kW5k">{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/stuff/index.html | title=The Stuff of Thought | publisher=Harvard University | access-date=May 30, 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163145/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/stuff/index.html | archive-date=May 9, 2008}}</ref>

Pinker is critical of theories about the [[Evolution of language|evolutionary origins of language]] that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition. He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] — a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In ''How the Mind Works'', Pinker reiterates [[Immanuel Kant]]'s view that music is not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to "auditory cheesecake", stating that "As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless". This argument has been rejected by [[Daniel Levitin]] and [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], experts in [[music cognition]], who argue that music has had an important role in the evolution of human cognition.<ref name="nhl5X">{{cite journal | last1 = Levitin | first1 = D.

Pinker has also been critical of "[[whole language]]" reading instruction techniques, stating in ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', "...{{nbsp}}the dominant technique, called 'whole language,' the insight that [spoken] language is a naturally developing human instinct has been garbled into the evolutionarily improbable claim that ''reading'' is a naturally developing human instinct."<ref name="HnL6i">{{Citation|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How the Mind Works|publisher=[[W.

<!--[[File:NormandySupply edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Despite the immense violence of the [[Second World War]], as in [[Operation Overlord|the D-Day landings of 1944]], Steven Pinker argues that violence is decreasing.]]-->

In ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'', published in 2011, Pinker argues that violence, including tribal warfare, homicide, cruel punishments, child abuse, animal cruelty, domestic violence, lynching, pogroms, and international and civil wars, has decreased over multiple scales of time and magnitude. Pinker considers it unlikely that human nature has changed. In his view, it is more likely that human nature comprises inclinations toward violence and those that counteract them, the "better angels of our nature". He outlines six "major historical declines of violence" that all have their own socio/cultural/economic causes:<ref name="http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence">{{cite web|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Decline of Violence|url=http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence|publisher=IAI|access-date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>

# "The Pacification Process" – The rise of organized systems of government has a correlative relationship with the decline in violent deaths. As states expand they prevent tribal feuding, reducing losses.
# "The Civilizing Process" – Consolidation of centralized states and kingdoms throughout Europe results in the rise of criminal justice and commercial infrastructure, organizing previously chaotic systems that could lead to raiding and mass violence.
# "The Humanitarian Revolution" – The 18th to 20th century abandonment of institutionalized violence by the state (breaking on the wheel, burning at the stake). Suggests this is likely due to the spike in literacy after the invention of the printing press thereby allowing the proletariat to question conventional wisdom.
# "The Long Peace" – The powers of 20th Century believed that period of time to be the bloodiest in history. This led to a largely peaceful 65-year period post World War I and World War II. Developed countries have stopped warring (against each other and colonially), adopted democracy, and this has led a massive decline (on average) of deaths.
# "The New Peace" – The decline in organized conflicts of all kinds since the end of the Cold War.
# "The Rights Revolutions" – The reduction of systemic violence at smaller scales against vulnerable populations (racial minorities, women, children, homosexuals, animals).

Pinker is a frequent participant in public debates surrounding the contributions of science to contemporary society. Social commentators such as Ed West, author of ''The Diversity Illusion'', consider Pinker important and daring in his willingness to confront taboos, as in ''The Blank Slate''. According to West, the doctrine of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' remained accepted "as fact, rather than fantasy"<ref name="WestTelegraph">{{cite web | url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100177038/a-decade-after-steven-pinkers-the-blank-slate-why-is-human-nature-still-taboo/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819195114/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100177038/a-decade-after-steven-pinkers-the-blank-slate-why-is-human-nature-still-taboo/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=August 19, 2012 | title=A decade after Steven Pinker's The Blank Slate, why is human nature still taboo? | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=August 17, 2012 | access-date=May 30, 2014 | author=West, Ed}}</ref> a decade after the book's publication.

In 2007, Pinker was noted for having identified the rename of Phillip Morris to [[Altria]] as an "egregious example" of [[phonesthesia]], with the company attempting to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive carcinogens to a place or state marked by altruism and other lofty values".<ref name="6AmTY">{{cite book |first1=Steven |last1=Pinker |date=2007 |title=The Stuff of Thought |publisher=Penguin Books |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TadLeA84f7UC&pg=PT451 304]}}</ref>

In an appearance for [[BBC World Service]]'s "Exchanges At The Frontier" programme, an audience member questioned whether the virtuous developments in culture and human nature (documented in ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'') could have expressed in our biology either through genetic or epigenetic expression. Pinker responded that it was unlikely since "some of the declines have occurred far too rapidly for them to be explicable by biological evolution which has a speed limit measured in generations, but crime can plummet in a span of 15 years and some of these humanitarian reforms like eliminating slavery and torture occurred in say 50 years".<ref name="F4e6e">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00m98km Exchanges At The Frontier 2011]", BBC.</ref> Helga Vierich and Cathryn Townsend wrote a critical review of Pinker's sweeping "civilizational" explanations for patterns of human violence and warfare in response to a lecture he gave at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in September 2015.<ref name="um9e1">Human violence and morality http://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/pdf/10.3828/hgr.2015.7</ref>

In his 2018 book ''[[Enlightenment Now]]'', Pinker posited that enlightenment rationality should be defended against attacks from both the political left and political right.<ref>[https://harvardmagazine.com/2018/03/steven-pinker-enlightenment-now Can Science Justify Itself?] Ada Palmer. ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', March–April 2018.</ref> The book received both positive and critical reviews. In a debate with Pinker, post-colonial theorist [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]] said that Pinker downplayed the immoral consequences of Enlightenment philosophy, such as inequality, slavery, imperialism, world wars, and genocide. Pinker responded that humanity, prior to the Enlightenment, had been characterized by poverty and disease.<ref name="PQPaB">{{Cite web|url=https://iainews.iai.tv/articles/does-the-enlightenment-need-defending-auid-1149|title=Does the Enlightenment Need Defending?|date=September 13, 2018|website=IAI TV - Philosophy for our times: cutting edge debates and talks from the world's leading thinkers|access-date=December 4, 2018}}</ref> Pinker also wrote a detailed response to many such objections to the thesis presented in "Enlightenment Now".<ref name="Ck852">{{Cite web|url=https://quillette.com/2019/01/14/enlightenment-wars-some-reflections-on-enlightenment-now-one-year-later/|title=Enlightenment Wars: Some Reflections on 'Enlightenment Now,' One Year Later|date=January 14, 2019}}</ref>
