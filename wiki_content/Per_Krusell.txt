He received numerous awards and grants, most recently the 2007 SÃ¶derberg Prize and a 2.1 Million Euro 2008 senior research grant from the European Research Council.

He is currently pursuing a long-term project on the interactions between global climate change and the economy.  He is especially known for developing the most widely used computational [[algorithm]] for calculating [[dynamic stochastic general equilibrium|macroeconomic equilibrium]] under [[rational expectations]] in economies with [[heterogeneous agents]] and aggregate uncertainty when financial markets are incomplete.<ref>Per Krusell and [[Anthony A. Smith, Jr.]], (1998), 'Income and wealth heterogeneity in the macroeconomy'. ''Journal of Political Economy'' 106 (5), pp. 867-96.</ref> His work with Jeremy Greenwood and [[Zvi Hercowitz]] on [[investment-specific technological progress]] has also been extremely influential.<ref>Jeremy Greenwood, Per Krusell and [[Zvi Hercowitz]], (1997), 'Long-Run Implications of Investment-Specific Technological Change'.

1. '''''"Long-Run Implications of Investment-Specific Technological Progress",{{jstor|2951349}} American Economic Review, June 1997, (with Jeremy Greenwood and [[Zvi Hercowitz]]).'''''
Casual empiricism suggests that technological progress is often embodied in the form of new and improved capital goods. Many examples come to mind: computers, robots, cell phones and the like. The paper analyzes the role of this type of technological change in U.S. economic growth. The results suggest that [[investment-specific technological progress]] accounts for the major part of U.S. economic growth over the postwar period.<ref>Some history for this research is here:  http://hdl.handle.net/1802/2375</ref>

This research incorporates the notion of [[investment-specific technological progress]] into a business cycle model.
