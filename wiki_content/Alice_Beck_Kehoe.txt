'''Alice Beck Kehoe''' (born 1934, [[New York City]]) is a feminist [[anthropologist]] and [[archaeologist]]. She has done considerable field research among Native American peoples in the upper plains of the US and Canada, and has authored research volumes on Native American archaeology and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] history. She is also the author of several general anthropology and archaeology textbooks.

==Education==
She attended [[Barnard College]] and [[Harvard University]], from which she received her PhD in Anthropology. While a student at Barnard, she was influenced by James Ford, Gordon Ekholm, and [[Junius Bird]]; she worked summers at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] Anthropology Department. While at Harvard, she worked with [[Gordon Willey]] and Evon Vogt. Many of her influences have been colleagues such as [[David H. Kelley]], Jane Kelley, Jennifer Brown, [[Robert L. Hall]], [[George F. Carter]] and his students Stephen C. Jett and Carl Johannesen.

==Career==
Kehoe taught at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] before teaching at [[Marquette University]], from which she retired in 2000 as professor [[emeritus]]. She resides in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin. Kehoe has held offices with the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), and was president of the [[Central States Anthropological Society]] (CSAS).

Kehoe has studied many aspects of Native America and is a strong believer in the theoretical link between the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] (SECC) (of the Native southeastern U.S.) and [[Mesoamerica]] ([[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]). Her principal area of interest is the archaeology and cultures of the northwestern plains of the U.S. While searching for an ethnographic research topic for her dissertation, she happened upon the Saskatchewan Dakota New Tidings [[Ghost Dance]]. Kehoe has worked many years with the Blackfeet of the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]], an [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] Native American group of Browning, [[Montana]], with whom she visits each year to study their history and culture. She has studied Native American spiritual healers ("medicine people") and worked with Piakwutch, "an elderly deeply respected [[Cree]] man who served his [[Saskatchewan]] Cree community...".<ref name="Kehoe2000">{{cite book|last1=Kehoe|first1=Alice Beck|title=Shamans and Religion: An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking|date=1 September 2000|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=978-1577661627}}</ref>{{rp|60}} She has also worked among Native Americans of [[Bolivia]] at [[Lake Titicaca]], where she chewed [[coca]] leaves with Native women of the region.<ref name="Kehoe2000"/>{{rp|70}}

Kehoe has taken some contrarian or controversial positions throughout her career. One of the original proponents of  [[feminist archaeology]], she coedited with [[Sarah Milledge Nelson]] one of the first collections of feminist archaeology papers, ''Powers of Observation'' in 1990. She is one of the few  in the field with an expansive view of  pre-Columbian transoceanic contacts, summarized in her book ''Traveling Prehistoric Seas''. This interest led to her meeting Richard Nielsen, who asked her to advise on archaeological aspects while testing the [[Kensington Runestone]] of [[Minnesota]]. Though a majority of relevant scholars have concluded the Runestone is a 19th Century hoax,<ref>{{cite journal|first=Helmer|last=Gustavson|title=The non-enigmatic runes of the Kensington stone|volume=2004|issue=3|journal=Viking Heritage Magazine|publisher=Gotland University}} "[...] every Scandinavian runologist and expert in Scandinavian historical linguistics has declared the Kensington stone a hoax [...]";

Nevertheless there remains a community convinced of the stone's authenticity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2005/desember/1133429879.66|title=forskning.no Kan du stole på Wikipedia?|language=no|access-date=2008-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007033631/http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2005/desember/1133429879.66|archive-date=2007-10-07|url-status=dead}} "Det finnes en liten klikk med amerikanere som sverger til at steinen er ekte.

They are mainly natural scientists of Scandinavian descent with no knowledge of linguistics, and they have large numbers of adherents."</ref> Kehoe is satisfied the item represents actual runic writing by members of a Scandinavian voyage to North America in the 14th century.

Her interpretation of the Kensington Runestone convinced Kehoe of a different North American history than what is widely taught in schools. She states:
{{quote|It has been conventional to treat American history as if it were identical with United States history. Such a myopic view cuts students off from the context in which the United States developed, a larger history that will not go away. America's history begins some fourteen thousand years ago ... Invading Europeans met no wilderness, but landscapes and resources rendered through millennia of human actions.<ref name="Kehoe2002">{{cite book|last1=Kehoe|first1=Alice Beck|title=America Before the European Invasions|date=7 August 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0582414860}}</ref>{{rp|1}}}}
In her many years of teaching and writing, Kehoe has emphasized the importance of critical thinking in looking at [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and [[history]], particularly as it pertains to Native America. She speaks of the "limited and biased archaeological record" (2007:personal communication) of the Americas and of how many archaeologists were molded by preconceptions of ancient Amerindians having been "savage" or "primitive" and incapable of having "real" civilizations in European terms. Kehoe minces few words in her distaste for such tunnel-visioned attitudes, stating, for example, "...the massive mounds of the Midwest, most of them larger than any prehistoric mounds in Europe, could not be accommodated in a scenario of virgin wilderness inhabited by Men-Brutes..."<ref name="Kehoe1998a">{{cite book|last1=Kehoe|first1=Alice Beck|title=The Land of Prehistory: A Critical History of American Archaeology|date=27 August 1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415920544}}</ref>{{rp|164}}
{{quote|The history of American archaeology ... is a remarkable example of post-hoc objectification of the doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]]. From its inception, American archaeology has been politically charged, legitimating domination of North America by capitalists imbued with British bourgeois culture.<ref name="Kehoe1998a" />{{rp|xi}}}}

In 2016, Kehoe was honored by the Plains Anthropological Association with its Distinguished Service Award for her "enduring work in Anthropology and Archaeology of the Great Plains" (wording on plaque presented to Kehoe).
