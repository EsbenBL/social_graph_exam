[[File:Honored Ammar Bouhouche .png|alt=Honored Ammar Bouhouche|thumb|200x200px|Honored Ammar Bouhouche]]
"Bouhouche is one of the most prominent specialist in the fields of [[political science]] and public administration and methodology", said Dr. [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], the former General Secretary of the United Nations, who described Bouhouche's book ''Evolution of Theories and Political Systems'' as one of the best books he has ever read about political science. He appreciated his efforts to compare political systems of Chinese, Russian, Cuban and Algerian revolutions. The leaders of each revolution succeeded in developing their own particular political systems.

In the field of public administration, Bouhouche wrote three outstanding textbooks. He founded the specialty in political science called the science of organization. This Department was created in 1971 when Mohamed Seddik Ben Yahia decided to make reforms in the programs of high education. Mr. Ben Yahia invited Mr. Bouhouche and talked to him about his desires to create the science of management at the Algerian universities. Professor Bouhouche advised Mr. Ben Yahia to focus on the field of public administration, but he said that this subject is taught at the national School of Administration. At the end, the Minister responded favorably to Bouhouche's proposal and created the Department of Sciences of Organization.

Bouhouche and his Jordanian colleague Dr. Mohamed Mahmoud Thneibat have written one of the best books in the science of methodology, in the year 2000. Up to now, the book has been re-edited and published 8 times by the Office of Academic Publications,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opu-dz.com/portal/|title=Office des publications universitaires|website=www.opu-dz.com}}</ref> students and researchers in social sciences have learned a lot from this book.
