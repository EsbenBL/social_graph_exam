'''Ferdinand Tönnies''' ({{IPA-de|ˈtœniːs|lang}}; 26 July 1855 – 9 April 1936) was a [[Germans|German]] [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[economist]], and [[philosopher]]. He was a significant contributor to [[sociological theory]] and [[Field_research|field studies]], best known for distinguishing between two types of [[social groups]], [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]] (''community and society''). He co-founded the [[German Society for Sociology]] together with [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]] and many other founders. He was president of the society from 1909 to 1933,<ref>{{Cite web|title=DGS – Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie: Vorsitzende der DGS|url=https://soziologie.de/dgs/geschichte/vorsitzende-der-dgs|access-date=2021-03-08|website=soziologie.de}}</ref> after which he was ousted for having [[German_resistance_to_Nazism|criticized the Nazis]]. Tönnies was regarded as the first proper German sociologist and published over 900 works, contributing to many areas of sociology and philosophy.  Tönnies, [[Max Weber]], and [[Georg Simmel]] are considered the founding fathers of classical German sociology. Though there has been a resurgence of interest in Weber and Simmel, Tönnies has not drawn as much attention.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Adair-Toteff|first=Christopher|date=1995|title=Ferdinand Tonnies: Utopian Visionary|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/202006|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=13|issue=1|pages=58–65|doi=10.2307/202006|jstor=202006|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Ferdinand Tönnies (TOHN-yehs)  was born on 26 July 1855 on the Haubuarg "De Reap," [[Oldenswort]] on the [[Eiderstedt]] Peninsula into a wealthy farmer's family in [[North Frisia|North Frisia, Schleswig]], then under [[Denmark|Danish]] rule. Tönnies was the only sociologist of his generation who came from the countryside. He was the third child of church chief and farmer August Ferdinand Tönnies (1822–1883),  and his wife Ida Frederica (born Mau, 1826–1915),  came from a theological family from East Holstein. His father, of Frisian ancestry, was a successful farmer and cattle rancher, while his mother hailed from a line of Lutheran ministers. The two had seven children, four sons and three daughters. On the day he was born, Ferdinand Tönnies received the baptismal name of Ferdinand Julius and moved to Husum, on the North Sea, after his father retired in 1864. 

=== Education and Academic Career ===
Tönnies enrolled at the University of Strasbourg after graduating from high school in 1872. They took the time to utilize his freedom to travel, exploring the academic fields of the University of [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]]. At age 22, he received a doctorate in philology at the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1877 (with a [[Latin]] thesis on the ancient [[Siwa Oasis]]).<ref>''De Jove Ammone questionum specimen'', Phil. Diss., [[Tübingen University|Tübingen]] 1877</ref> However, by this time, his main interests had switched to political philosophy and social issues. After completing postdoctoral work at the University of Berlin, he traveled to London to continue his studies on the seventeenth-century English political thinker Thomas Hobbes. Tönnies earned a Privatdozent in philosophy at the University of Kiel from 1909 to 1933 after submitting a draft of his major book, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, as his Habilitationsschrift in 1881.He held this post at the University of [[Kiel]] for only three years. Because he sympathized with the [[Hamburg]] dockers' strike of 1896,<ref>Ferdinand Tönnies: ''Hafenarbeiter und Seeleute in Hamburg vor dem Strike 1896/97'', in: Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung und Statistik, 1897, vol. 10/2, p. 173-238</ref> the conservative [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] government considered him to be a [[social democrat]], and Tönnies would not be called to a professorial chair until 1913. He returned to Kiel as a [[professor emeritus]] in 1921 where he took on a teaching position in sociology and taught until 1933 when he was ousted by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], due to earlier publications in which he had criticized them.<ref>See Uwe Carsten, ''Ferdinand Tönnies: Friese und Weltbürger'', Norderstedt 2005, p. 287–299.</ref> Remaining in Kiel, he died three years later in 1936. 

=== Sociological Contributions ===
Many of his writings on sociological theories furthered pure sociology, including [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'']] (1887). He coined the metaphysical term ''[[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|Voluntarism]]''. Tönnies also contributed to the study of [[social change]], particularly on [[public opinion]],<ref>''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', [1922], in: ''Ferdinand Tönnies Gesamtausgabe'', tom. 14, ed. [[Alexander Deichsel]]/Rolf Fechner/Rainer Waßner, de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2002</ref> [[customs]] and [[technology]], [[crime]], and [[suicide]].<ref>Cf. ''Der Selbstmord von Maennern in Preussen'', [''Mens en Maatschappij'', 1933], in: ''Ferdinand Tönnies Gesamtausgabe'', tom. 22, ed. [[Lars Clausen]], de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 1998, p. 357-380.</ref> He also had a vivid interest in methodology, especially [[statistics]], and sociological research, inventing his own technique of [[statistical]] association.<ref>[[Lars Clausen]]: ''Ferdinand Tönnies (1855–1936)'', in: ''Christiana Albertina'', No. 63, Kiel 2006, p.&nbsp;663-69</ref> After publishing [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], Tönnies focused aspects of the social life such as [[Morality|morals]], [[Mores|folkways]], and [[public opinion]]. However he is best known for his published work on [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]] because his later works applied the same concepts to aspects of social life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heberle|first=Rudolf|date=1937|title=The Sociology of Ferdinand Tönnies|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2084562|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=2|issue=1|pages=9–25|doi=10.2307/2084562|jstor=2084562|issn=0003-1224}}</ref>

==''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft''==
{{main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}}
Tönnies distinguished between two types of social groupings. ''Gemeinschaft''—often translated as [[Community|''community'']] (or left untranslated)—refers to groups based on feelings of togetherness and mutual bonds, which are felt like a goal to be kept up, their members being means for this goal. ''Gesellschaft''—often translated as [[Society|''society'']]—on the other hand, refers to groups that are sustained by it being instrumental for their members' aims and goals. The equilibrium in ''Gemeinschaft'' is achieved through means of social control, such as morals, conformism, and exclusion, while ''Gesellschaft'' keeps its balance through police, laws, tribunals, and prisons. Amish and Hassidic communities are examples of ''Gemeinschaft'', while states are types of ''Gesellschaft''. Rules in ''Gemeinschaft'' are implicit, while ''Gesellschaft'' has explicit rules (written laws). 



''Gemeinschaft'' may be exemplified historically by a [[family]] or a [[neighborhood]] in a pre-modern (rural) society; ''Gesellschaft'' by a joint-stock company or a state in a modern society, i.e. the society when Tönnies lived. ''Gesellschaft'' relationships arose in an urban and capitalist setting, characterized by [[individualism]] and impersonal monetary connections between people. Social ties were often instrumental and superficial, with self-interest and exploitation increasingly the norm. Examples are [[corporation]]s, [[State (polity)|states]], or [[voluntary association]]s. In his book ''Einteilung der Soziologie'' (Classification of Sociology) he distinguished between three disciplines of sociology, being Pure or Theoretical (''reine, theoretische'') Sociology, Applied (''angewandte'') Sociology, and Empirical (''emprische'') Sociology.

His distinction between social groupings is based on the assumption that there are only two primary forms of an actor's will to approve of other men. For Tönnies, such approval is by no means self-evident; he is pretty influenced by [[Thomas Hobbes]].<ref name=":0" /> Following his "essential will" ("Wesenwille"), an actor will see himself as a means to serve the goals of social grouping; very often, it is an underlying, [[subconscious]] force. Groupings formed around an essential will are called a Gemeinschaft. The other will is the "arbitrary will" ("Kürwille"): An actor sees a social grouping as a means to further his individual goals, so it is purposive and future-oriented. Groupings around the latter are called Gesellschaft. Whereas the membership in a Gemeinschaft is self-fulfilling, a Gesellschaft is instrumental for its members. In pure sociology—theoretically—these two [[Normal type|standard types]] of will are to be strictly separated; in applied sociology—empirically—they are always mixed.

'''Gender Polarity in "''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft"'''''

What is less well-known when discussing the work of Tonnies is that he frequently uses gender concepts to explain his main ideas. Essential will-arbitrary will, Gemeinschaft-Gesellschaft, are all thought of in terms of the polarity of feminine-masculine. Gemeinschaft, for example, is feminine: "the eternal-feminine," since motherliness is the basis of all being together. Essential will is also feminine, whereas Gesellschaft and arbitrary choice are masculine. <ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Stafford|first=William|date=September 1995|title=Ferdinand Tönnies on Gender, Women and the Family|journal=History of Political Thought|volume=16|pages=391|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> Tonnies' theory appears to consign him to a nineteenth-century view of the public world belonging to males, while women are relegated to the private realm, as it links together Gemeinschaft/home/woman as opposed to Gesellschaft/marketplace/man. 

'''Views on Family'''

In his article "''Funfzehn Thesen zur Erneuerung eines Familienlebens''," published in 1893, he claims that the dissolution of family life has tainted modern society's blood. Tonnies believed that one of the most important ways to resurrect Gemeinschaft in the modern world would be to improve and prolong family life. <ref name=":1" /> 

The demise of the family is caused by modern capitalism and its consequences: low pay, excessive hours of labor for men and women alike, and terrible living conditions. He believes family life has to be revitalized since it is the foundation of all culture and morals. <ref name=":1" />  In this case, he proposed two solutions that revolved around the idea of unions devoted to aid and nurture, as he would claim, "the family spirit."

'''Two Solutions''' 

# The first would be groupings of organically linked families who, in order to strengthen family life, would preserve family documents, correspond regularly, gather at family festivals, and assist one another by pooling resources. A family fund would be set up to help those who had fallen on hard times or who required money to develop unique skills. 
# The second version would bring together unrelated families and be dedicated to a simpler and healthier way of life, a more serious and reasonable method of social interaction, and a better comprehension of masculine and feminine thought. Three to five families would choose to band together to achieve these goals; eventually, they might live together in a common residence,  engage in cooperative purchasing, and even share products. Groups may eventually band together in order to gain greater economic and moral power.  <ref name=":1" /> 

== Criticisms ==
Tönnies' distinction between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'', like others between tradition and modernity, has been criticized for over-generalizing differences between societies and implying that all societies were following a similar evolutionary path, an argument which Tönnies himself never actually proclaimed.<ref>''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig 1887, §§ 1–40</ref>
