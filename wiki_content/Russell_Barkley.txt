==Early life and education==

Russell Alan Barkley was born in [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh, New York]].

Barkley believes between 5-7% of children have ADHD.<Ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/articles/an-interview-with-russell-a-barkley-phd-314638|title = Addressing Controversy in ADHD: An Interview with Russell A. Barkley, PHD}}</ref>

==Views on medication==

In 1978, Barkley wrote that "Stimulant drug studies based primarily on measures of teacher opinion have frequently concluded that these drugs improve the achievement of hyperkinetic children. However, a review of those studies using more objective measures of academic performance revealed few positive short-term or long-term drug effects on these measures. What few improvements have been noted can be readily attributed to better attention during testing. The major effect of the stimulants appears to be an improvement in classroom manageability rather than academic performance".<ref name="tandfonline.com">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02796015.1991.12085546|doi=10.1080/02796015.1991.12085546|title=Therapeutic Effects of Medication on ADHD: Implications for School Psychologists|year=1991|last1=Dupaul|first1=George J.|last2=Barkley|first2=Russell A.|last3=McMurray|first3=Mary B.|journal=School Psychology Review|volume=20|issue=2|pages=203–219}}</ref> In 1991, Barkley noted that "Psychostimulant medications (e.g., Ritalin) are highly effective treatments for the symptomatic management of children with ADHD as they can enhance significantly their attention span, impulse control, academic performance, and peer relationships".<ref name="tandfonline.com"/>

In response to critics who point to countries with lower rates of diagnoses and medication of children for ADHD, Barkley said, "So what? We do not let the rest of the world set our standards of care when we do more research on childhood disorders--specifically ADHD--than other countries combined?".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/dec01/medicating |title=Medicating ADHD: Too much? Too soon? |work=www.apa.org |access-date=2020-04-05 |language=en}}</ref>

Barkley believes that drugs such as Adderall, Ritalin and Concerta should be downgraded to schedule III.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/interviews/barkley.html|title=Medicating kids|date=10 April 2001}}</ref>

During an interview in 2001, Barkley said that "All of the research we have indicates that these drugs are some of the safest that we employ in the field of psychiatry and psychology. That's not to say that we know everything about them. But we know a lot more than we know about cough medicines and Tylenol and aspirins and other things that children swill whenever they come down with a common cold. Nobody asks those questions about those over-the-counter medications, yet we know substantially less about them".<ref name="PBS 2001">{{cite web | title=Interviews - Russell Barkley - Medicating Kids - FRONTLINE - PBS | website=PBS | date=2001-04-10 | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/interviews/barkley.html | access-date=2021-02-16}}</ref>

Barkley has compared “ADHD” to a physical handicap, with Ritalin being the equivalent of a wheelchair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dana.org/article/adhd-serious-psychiatric-problem-or-all-american-cop-out/|title = ADHD: Serious Psychiatric Problem or All-American Cop-out?}}</ref> On 16 November 1998 he said that "Ritalin will be ranked as one of the leading developments in this century for helping individuals".<ref>ADHD Nation - Alan Schwarz page 64</ref> In 1999 Barkley said "Once convinced of an ADHD diagnosis there is no compelling reason (For someone diagnosed with ADHD) to avoid Ritalin".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanpolicy.org/1999/03/29/ritalin-is-poison/|title = Ritalin is Poison|date = 29 March 1999}}</ref><ref>Now Tell Me I Was Wrong: 15 Years of Unheralded Wisdom and Warnings in the Battle for the Republic - page 65 - Tom DeWeese</ref>
