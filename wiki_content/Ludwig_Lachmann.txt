'''Ludwig Maurits Lachmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɑː|x|m|ən}}; {{IPA-de|ˈlaxman|lang}}; 1 February 1906 – 17 December 1990) was a [[Germany|German]] economist who became a member of and important contributor to the [[Austrian School]] of economics.

==Education and career==

Lachmann earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Berlin]], where he was enrolled as a graduate student from 1924 to 1933. He first became interested in [[Austrian School|Austrian economics]] while spending the summer of 1926 at the [[University of Zurich]].<ref name="Lewin"/> He graduated in 1930, and spent a few years to teach at the University.<ref name=AJES2000/> When Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933, Lachmann moved to England. At the [[London School of Economics]] he was a student and later colleague of [[Friedrich Hayek]], who held the prestigious Tooke Chair and looked for "allies in his battle against fashionable Keynesian theories". He deepened his interest in the [[Austrian School]], and was one of the few who chose Hayek's side.<ref name=AJES2000/>

In 1948, Lachmann moved to [[Johannesburg, South Africa]], where he accepted a professorship at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. He remained there until retiring in 1972. His student [[Peter Lewin]] described his influence in South Africa as "quiet, limited and subdued", quite in contrast to his New York years.<ref name="Lewin">{{cite book|author=Lewin, Peter|title= Ludwig Lachmann (1906–1990): Life and Work|publisher=[[Mises.org]]|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~plewin/Lachmann%20Legacy.htm}}</ref> 
He served as president of the Economic Society of South Africa from 1961 to 1963.<ref name="Corfield">{{cite book |last=Corfield |first=Justin |editor-first=James |editor-last=Ciment |title=Booms and Busts : an encyclopedia of economic history from Tulipmania of the 1630s to the global financial crisis of the 21st century |publisher=Sharpe |date=2010 |pages=459–460 |chapter=Lachmann, Ludwig Maurits |isbn=9780765682246}}</ref>

==Austrian School revival, New York City, 1974-1987==
Between 1974 and 1987, Lachmann traveled to [[New York City]] each year and collaborated on research with [[Israel Kirzner]] who intended to reinvigorate the Austrian school. One result of this collaboration was the 'Austrian Economics Seminar', organized by Lachmann as visiting professor at [[New York University]] each winter semester from 1975 to 1987.<ref name="Lewin"/> He was on residence there with his wife for four consecutive months, returning to South Africa in between for 12 consecutive years. A 1974 conference on Austrian Economics at Royalton College, in [[South Royalton, Vermont]] featured Lachmann, Kirzner, and [[Murray Rothbard]], who challenged prevailing Keynesianism, attracted 50 participants<ref name=AJES2000>{{cite journal|author1=Stephan Boehm |author2=Israel M Kirzner |author3=Roger Koppl |author4=Don Lavoie |author5=Peter Lewin |author6=Christopher Torr |title=Professor Ludwig M.

==On economics==
Lachmann grew to believe that the Austrian School had deviated from [[Carl Menger]]'s original vision of an entirely subjective economics. To Lachmann, Austrian Theory was an evolutionary, or "genetic-causal" approach, as opposed to the equilibrium and perfect-knowledge models used in mainstream [[neoclassical economics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
He was a strong advocate of using [[hermeneutic]] methods in the study of economic phenomena.<ref name="Corfield"/>
Lachmann's "fundamentalist Austrianism" was rare as few living Austrian economists departed from the mainstream. He underscored what he viewed as distinctive from that mainstream: [[economic subjectivism]], imperfect knowledge, the heterogeneity of capital, the [[business cycle]], [[methodological individualism]], [[alternative cost]] and "market process". His brand of Austrianism now forms the basis for the "[[radical subjectivist]]" strand of Austrian Economics.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
His work influenced later, American developments of the Austrian School.<ref name="Corfield"/> Lachmann was a close friend of and closely aligned intellectually with (though they disagreed on some finer details) fellow Austrian Economist [[Israel Kirzner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/kirznerian-way-interview-israel-m-kirzner|title = The Kirznerian Way: An Interview with Israel M. Kirzner|date = 30 July 2014}}</ref>

To commemorate Lachmann, his widow established a trust to fund the ''Ludwig M. Lachmann Research Fellowship'' at the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method of the London School of Economics.<ref>"Ludwig M Lachmann Research Fellowship."

== Contemporary social science research ==
Lachmann's ideas continue to influence contemporary social science research. Many social scientific disciplines explicitly or implicitly build on the subjective theory of value, developed by [[Carl Menger]] and the Austrian School of Economics.
