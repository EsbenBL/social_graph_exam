King's College, so named to indicate the patronage of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]], was founded in 1829 (though the roots of King's medical school, St. Thomas, date back to the 16th century with recorded first teaching in 1561<ref name="kings medical"/>) in response to the theological controversy surrounding the founding of "London University" (which later became [[University College London|University College, London]]) in 1826.<ref name="HIST">Cockburn, King, McDonnell (1969), pp. 345–359</ref><ref name="Foundation">{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/foundation.aspx |title=Foundation |publisher=King's College London|access-date=9 February 2013}}</ref> London University was founded, with the backing of [[Utilitarians]], [[Jews]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]], as a secular institution, intended to educate "the youth of our middling rich people between the ages of 15 or 16 and 20 or later"<ref>Hearnshaw (1929), p. 38</ref> giving its nickname, "the godless college in Gower Street".<ref>Hibbert, Weinreb, Keay, Keay (2008), p. 958</ref>

The need for such an institution was a result of the religious and social nature of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which then educated solely the sons of [[upper class|wealthy]] [[Anglicans]].<ref name="victorianweb.org">{{cite web |last=Banerjee |first=Jacqueline |title=The University of London: The Founding Colleges |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/education/ulondon/2.html|access-date=26 May 2007}}</ref> The secular nature of London University was disapproved by [[The Establishment]], indeed, "the storms of opposition which raged around it threatened to crush every spark of vital energy which remained".<ref>MacIlwraith (1884), p. 32</ref> Thus, the creation of a rival institution represented a [[Tory]] response to reassert the educational values of The Establishment.<ref name="Thompson5">Thompson (1990), p. 5</ref> More widely, King's was one of the first of a [[List of modern universities in Europe (1801–1945)#19th century|series of institutions]] which came about in the early nineteenth century as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and great social changes in England following the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name="somersethousebooklet">{{citation |title=King's College London and Somerset House |url=http://issuu.com/kingscollegelondon/docs/booklet_produced_by_the_college_to_promote_the_ide/1 |page=2 |publisher=King's College London |date=c. 1963|access-date=12 February 2013}}</ref> By virtue of its foundation King's has enjoyed the patronage of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] as its [[visitor]] and during the nineteenth century counted among its official governors the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and the [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref name="somersethousebooklet" />

==== Duel in Battersea Fields, 21 March 1829 ====
[[File:Sir Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.png|[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] and then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], fought a duel against the [[George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Winchilsea]] in 1829 over the Duke's support for the rights of Irish Catholics and the independence of the newly established King's College London|thumb|upright|left]]

The simultaneous support of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] (who was also [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] then), for an Anglican King's College London and the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Roman Catholic Relief Act]], which was to lead to the granting of almost full civil rights to Catholics, was challenged by [[George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea]], in early 1829. Winchilsea and his supporters wished for King's to be subject to the [[Test Acts]], like the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where only members of the Church of England could [[Matriculation#United Kingdom|matriculate]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where non-Anglicans could matriculate but not graduate,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/begskings.html |title=Beginnings: The History of Higher Education in Bloomsbury and Westminster – King's College London |publisher=[[Institute of Education]] |access-date=13 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007235307/http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/begskings.html |archive-date=7 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}} "Londoners who did study, for example in Oxford or Cambridge, had to be quite rich and also members of the Anglican Church."</ref> but this was not Wellington's intent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/page.aspx?pid=2723 |title=The famous Duel |publisher=King's College London|access-date=13 February 2013}}</ref>

Winchilsea and about 150 other contributors withdrew their support of King's College London in response to Wellington's support of [[Catholic emancipation]]. In a letter to Wellington he accused the Duke to have in mind "insidious designs for the infringement of our liberty and the introduction of Popery into every department of the State".<ref name="Holmes275">Holmes (2002), p. 275</ref> The letter provoked a furious exchange of correspondence and Wellington accused Winchilsea of imputing him with "disgraceful and criminal motives" in setting up King's College London. When Winchilsea refused to retract the remarks, Wellington – by his own admission, "no advocate of duelling" and a virgin duellist – demanded satisfaction in a contest of arms: "I now call upon your lordship to give me that satisfaction for your conduct which a gentleman has a right to require, and which a gentleman never refuses to give."<ref name="duelexhibtion">{{cite web |url=http://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/wellington/duel/insult |title=Winchilsea insults Wellington |publisher=King's College London College Archives|access-date=13 February 2013}}</ref>

The result was a [[duel]] in [[Battersea Park|Battersea Fields]] on 21 March 1829.<ref name="Foundation" /><ref name="dueldayqa">{{cite web |url=http://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/document.doc?id=41 |title=Duel Day – Questions and Answers |publisher=King's College London|access-date=9 February 2013}}</ref> Winchilsea did not fire, a plan he and his second almost certainly decided upon before the duel; Wellington took aim and fired wide to the right. Accounts differ as to whether Wellington missed on purpose. Wellington, noted for his poor aim, claimed he did, other reports more sympathetic to Winchilsea claimed he had aimed to kill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/wellington/duel/fire |title=Open Fire! |publisher=King's College London College Archives |access-date=13 February 2013}}</ref> Honour was saved and Winchilsea wrote Wellington an apology.<ref name="Holmes275" /> "Duel Day" is still celebrated on the first Thursday after 21 March every year, marked by various events throughout King's, including reenactments.<ref name="dueldayqa" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=539&year=2007 |title=Alumni celebrate Duel Day |publisher=King's College London |year=2007|access-date=23 January 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001180633/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=539&year=2007|archive-date=1 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Williamotter.jpg|thumb|[[William Otter]] (1831–36), the first Principal of King's College London]]
King's opened in October 1831 with the cleric [[William Otter]] appointed as first principal and lecturer in divinity.<ref name="HIST" /> The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] presided over the opening ceremony, in which a sermon was given in the chapel by [[Charles James Blomfield]], the [[Bishop of London]], on the subject of combining religious instruction with intellectual culture. Despite the attempts to make King's Anglican-only, the initial prospectus permitted, "nonconformists of all sorts to enter the college freely".<ref name="Hearnshaw">Hearnshaw (1929), p. 80</ref> [[William Howley]]: the governors and the professors, except the linguists, had to be members of the Church of England but the students did not,<ref name="Hibbert">Hibbert, Weinreb, Keay, Keay (2008), p. 462</ref> though attendance at chapel was compulsory.<ref>''Prospectus of King's College, London: academical year 1854-5'', p. 7</ref>

King's was divided into a senior department and a junior department, also known as [[King's College School]], which was originally situated in the basement of the Strand Campus.<ref name="HIST" /> The Junior department started with 85 pupils and only three teachers, but quickly grew to 500 by 1841, outgrowing its facilities and leading it to relocate to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in 1897 where it remains today, though it is no longer associated with King's College London.<ref name="Hibbert" /> Within the Senior department teaching was divided into three courses: a general course comprised divinity, classical languages, mathematics, English literature and history; a medical course; and miscellaneous subjects, such as law, political economy and modern languages, which were not related to any systematic course of study at the time and depended for their continuance on the supply of occasional students.<ref name="HIST" /> In 1833 the general course was reorganised leading to the award of the [[Associate of King's College]] (AKC), the first qualification issued by King's.<ref name="HIST" /> The course, which concerns questions of ethics and theology, is still awarded today to students and staff who take an optional three-year course alongside their studies.

[[File:Strand102.jpg|The Embankment terrace entrance to the Strand Campus overlooking the [[River Thames]], originally designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|Sir William Chambers]], was completed by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]] in 1835|thumb|right]]

The river frontage was completed in April 1835 at a cost of £7,100,<ref>Thompson (1986), p. 6</ref> its completion a condition of King's College London securing the site from the Crown.<ref name="HIST" /> Unlike those in the school, student numbers in the Senior department remained almost stationary during King's first five years of existence. During this time the medical school was blighted by inefficiency and the divided loyalties of the staff leading to a steady decline in attendance. One of the most important appointments was that of [[Charles Wheatstone]] as professor of Experimental Philosophy.<ref name="HIST" />

At this time neither King's, "London University", nor the medical schools at the London hospitals could confer degrees. In 1835 the government announced that it would establish an examining board to grant degrees, with "London University" and King's both becoming affiliated colleges. This became the [[University of London]] in 1836, the former "London University" becoming ''University College, London'' (UCL).<ref name="victorianweb.org" /> The first University of London degrees were awarded to King's College London students in 1839.<ref name=historyandtoday>{{cite web |title=History & today |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/dates.aspx |website=About King's |publisher=King's College London|access-date=31 January 2016}}</ref>

In 1840, King's opened its own [[King's College Hospital|hospital]] on Portugal Street near [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], an area composed of overcrowded [[Rookery (slum)|rookeries]] characterised by poverty and disease. The governance of [[King's College Hospital]] was later transferred to the corporation of the hospital established by the King's College Hospital Act 1851. The hospital moved to new premises in [[Denmark Hill]], [[Camberwell]] in 1913. The appointment in 1877 of [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] as professor of clinical surgery greatly benefited the medical school, and the introduction of Lister's [[antiseptic]] surgical methods gained the hospital an international reputation.<ref name="HIST" />

In 1845 King's established a Military Department to train officers for the Army and the [[British East India Company]], and in 1846 a Theological Department to train Anglican priests. In 1855, King's pioneered evening classes in London;<ref name="Hibbert" /> that King's granted students at the evening classes certificates of college attendance to enable them to sit University of London degree exams was cited as an example of the worthlessness of these certificates in the decision by the University of London to end the affiliated colleges system in 1858 and open their examinations to everyone.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcI2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1005 |work=The Athenaeum |title=Opening of the University of London |pages=1005–1007 |date=8 August 1857 |volume=1554}}</ref>

In 1882 the King's College London Act amended the constitution. The act removed the proprietorial nature of King's, changing the name of the corporation from "The Governors and Proprietors of King's College, London" to "King's College London" and annulling the 1829 charter (although King's remained incorporated under that charter). The act also changed King's College London from a (technically) for-profit corporation to a non-profit one (no dividends had ever been paid in over 50 years of operation) and extended the objects of King's to include the education of women.<ref name="HIST" /><ref>{{cite book |title=The Calendar of King's College, London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-osAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR5 |date=1896 |pages=v–xvii}}</ref> The Ladies' Department of King's College London was opened in [[Kensington Square]] in 1885, which later in 1902 became King's College Women's Department<!--Not to be styled as KCL Women's Department – King's College Women's Department is the formal name.-->.<ref name=historyandtoday />

The King's College London Act 1903, abolished all remaining religious tests for staff, except within the Theological department. In 1910, King's was (with the exception of the Theological department) merged into the University of London under the King's College London (Transfer) Act 1908, losing its legal independence.<ref name="UoL Hist Rec">{{cite book |title=University of London, the Historical Record: (1836–1912) |publisher=[[University of London]] |date=1912 |pages=7–24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyPiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA7}}</ref>

During World War I the medical school was opened to women for the first time. The end of the war saw an influx of students, which strained existing facilities to the point where some classes were held in the Principal's house.<ref name="HIST" />

In World War II, the buildings of King's College London were used by the [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] with a number of King's staff, mainly those then known as college servants, serving as [[fire lookouts|firewatchers]]. Parts of the Strand building, the [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], and the roof of [[apse]] and stained glass windows of the chapel suffered bomb damage in [[the Blitz]].<ref>Heulin (1979), p. 2</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/campuslife/campuses/strand/QuadbriefCA07nocompdetails.pdf |title=The Strand Quadrangle Architectural Competition Preliminary briefing paper |publisher=King's College London|access-date=4 March 2013}}</ref> During the post-war reconstruction, the vaults beneath the quadrangle were replaced by a two-storey laboratory, which opened in 1952, for the departments of Physics and Civil and Electrical Engineering.<ref name="HIST" />

One of the most famous pieces of scientific research performed at King's were the crucial contributions to the discovery of the [[double helix]] structure of [[DNA]] in 1953 by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]], together with [[Ray Gosling|Raymond Gosling]], [[Alex Stokes]], [[Herbert Wilson]] and other colleagues at the [[Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics]] at King's.<ref>Maddox (2002), p. 124</ref><ref name="Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin">{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/wilkinsfranklin.aspx |title=Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin |publisher=King's College London |access-date=21 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="King's, DNA & the continuing story">{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/biohealth/research/divisions/randall/about/history/dna.aspx |title=King's, DNA & the continuing story |publisher=King's College London |access-date=21 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709055223/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/biohealth/research/divisions/randall/about/history/dna.aspx |archive-date=9 July 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Major reconstruction of King's began in 1966 following the publication of the [[Robbins Report]] on Higher Education. A new block facing the Strand designed by E. D.

In 1993 King's, along with other large University of London colleges, gained direct access to government funding (which had previously been through the university) and the right to confer University of London degrees itself. This contributed to King's and the other large colleges being regarded as ''de facto'' universities in their own right.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title=College vote brings break-up of university a step nearer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/10/highereducation.administration |quote="Over the past 10 years the university has become an increasingly loose federation of independent institutions that are universities in their own right and receive their grants directly from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, although they still hand out degrees on behalf of the central university." |date=10 December 2005 |author1=Rebecca Smithers |author2=Donald MacLeod}}</ref>

King's College London underwent several mergers with other institutions in the late 20th century. These including the reincorporation in 1983 of the King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, which had become independent of King's College Hospital at the foundation of the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in 1948, mergers with
[[Queen Elizabeth College]] and [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology|Chelsea College]] in 1985, and the [[Institute of Psychiatry]] in 1997. In 1998 the [[United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals]] merged with King's to form the [[GKT School of Medical Education]].<ref name="Hibbert" /><ref name=historyandtoday /><ref name="Dates">{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/dates.aspx |title=Dates: 1900–1949 |access-date=21 January 2013 |publisher=King's College London}}</ref><ref name=kingsdental /> Also in 1998 [[Florence Nightingale]]'s original training school for nurses merged with the King's Department of Nursing Studies as the [[Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery]].

No correspondence is believed to have survived regarding the choice of this coat of arms, either in King's archives or at the [[College of Arms]], and a variety of unofficial adaptations have been used throughout the history of King's. The current coat of arms was developed following the mergers with Queen Elizabeth College and Chelsea College in 1985 and incorporates aspects of their heraldry.<ref name="Branding Essentials" /> The official coat of arms, in [[Blazon|heraldic terminology]], is:<ref name="coatofarms">{{citation |title=King's College London Corporate identity guidelines |year=2008 |page=4 |author=King's College London}}</ref>

Although the [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School]] and Guy's Medical School became legal bodies separate from [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and [[Guy's Hospital]] in 1948, the tradition of using the hospitals' shields and coat of arms continues today.<ref name=basics>{{cite web |title=The basics |url=https://internal.kcl.ac.uk/erd/depts/brand/day-to-day-essentials/Documents/Corporate-identity-guidelines-updated/brand-guidelines-The-basics.pdf |publisher=King's College London|access-date=20 January 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1949, St Thomas's Hospital Medical School was granted its own coat of arms. However, the St Thomas' Hospital coat of arms has still been used.<ref name=basics /> Guy’s Medical School proposed to apply for its own coat of arms after separating from Guy’s Hospital, yet the school decided to continue to use Guy's Hospital’s arms in 1954.<ref name=basics /> The two medical schools merged in 1982 and became the [[United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals]] (UMDS). Simon Argles, secretary of UMDS, said that because of the name of the medical school it was more appropriate to use the hospital's coat of arms.<ref name=basics />

UMDS merged with [[King's College Hospital]] to become [[GKT School of Medical Education|Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine]] in 1998. The shields of Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals are used in conjunction with King's shield in the medical schools' publications and graduation materials.<ref name=basics />

=== Associateship of King's College ===
The [[Associateship of King's College]] (AKC) is the original award of King's College, dating back to its foundation in 1829 and first awarded in 1835. It was designed to reflect the twin objectives of King's College's 1829 royal charter to maintain the connection between "sound religion and useful learning" and to teach the "doctrines and duties of Christianity".<ref>{{cite web |title=AKC |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/principal/dean/akc/AKC-Handbook/starting/values.aspx |publisher=King's College London |access-date=10 March 2015}}</ref>

Today, the AKC is a modern tradition that offers an inclusive, research-led programme of lectures that gives students the opportunities to engage with religious, philosophical and ethical issues alongside their main degree course. Graduates of King’s College London may be eligible to be elected as 'Associates' of King's College by the authority of King's College London council, delegated to the academic board. After election, they are entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] "AKC".<ref>{{cite web |title=How to become an AKC |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/principal/dean/akc/AKC-Handbook/assessment/election.aspx |publisher=King's College London|access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Rivalry with University College London ===
{{Main|King's College London–UCL rivalry|The London Varsity}}
[[File:UCL-KCL Varsity Rugby 2014.jpg|thumb|King's traditional rivalry with [[University College London|UCL]] is nowadays most noted at the yearly varsity rugby match]]

Competition within the [[University of London]] is most intense between King's and [[University College London]], the two oldest institutions. Indeed, the University of London when it was established has been described as "an umbrella organisation designed to disguise the rivalry between UCL and KCL."<ref name="Thompson7">Thompson (1990), p. 7</ref> In the early twentieth century, [[King's College London and UCL rivalry]] was centred on their respective [[mascot]]s.<ref name="varsity">{{cite web |url=http://www.thelondonvarsity.com/#/history/4541866243 |title=History – The London Varsity |publisher=[[The London Varsity]]|access-date=31 March 2013|archive-date=6 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180806142429/http://thelondonvarsity.com/#/history/4541866243|url-status=dead}}</ref> University College's was Phineas Maclino, a wooden [[tobacconist]]'s sign of a kilted Jacobite [[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]] purloined from outside a shop in [[Tottenham Court Road]] during the celebrations of the relief of [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] in 1900. King's later addition was a giant beer bottle representing "bottled youth". In 1923 it was replaced by a new mascot to rival Phineas – Reggie the Lion, who made his debut at a King's–[[University College London|UCL]] sporting [[Student Rags|rag]] in December 1923, protected by a lifeguard of engineering students armed with T-squares. Thereafter, Reggie formed the centrepiece of annual [[fresher]]s' processions by King's students around [[Aldwych]] in which new students were typically flour bombed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The College mascots: Phineas and Reggie |url=http://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/mayhem/origins/mascots |publisher=King's Collections|access-date=16 February 2016}}</ref>

Although riots between respective college students occurred in central London well into the 1950s, rivalry is now limited to the [[rugby union]] pitch and skulduggery over mascots, with the annual [[The London Varsity|London Varsity]] series culminating in the historic match between [[King's College Rugby Club|King's College London RFC]] and University College London RFC.<ref name="varsity" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unisportonline.co.uk/The-London-Varsity-LIVE/Sports-News/ |title=The London Varsity Live |date=29 February 2012 |publisher=UniSportOnline|access-date=31 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524071811/http://www.unisportonline.co.uk/The-London-Varsity-LIVE/Sports-News/|archive-date=24 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Rivalry with the London School of Economics ===
On 2 December 2005, tensions between King's and the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) were ignited when at least 200 students from LSE (located in [[Aldwych]] near the Strand Campus) diverted off from the annual "barrel run" and caused an estimated £32,000 of damage to the English department at King's.<ref name="rampage">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4506664.stm |title=Students in university rampage |work=[[BBC News]] |date=7 December 2005|access-date=20 November 2006}}</ref><ref>''The Beaver''.

<!--Possible original research?--!--King's appears to have been targeted, however, principally owing to its close proximity to LSE rather than by any ill-feeling. There is also somewhat of a sporting rivalry between the two institutions, albeit to a lesser extent than with UCL.-->

In the 2016 film, [[Inferno (2016 film)|Inferno]], the character Dr. Sienna Brooks had earlier informed the main character, [[Harvard University]] Professor Robert Langdon, in his hospital bed that she saw him lecture at [[Imperial College London]] when she was 9. Then after she rescues him from an assassin and takes him to her apartment, he sees a picture frame in her apartment with a newspaper cut-out in it stating "''Prodigy, 12, to attend King's College''".

On the second season of Spanish
[[Netflix]] Show [[Élite]] (2020), characters Cayetana, Polo and Valerio are having a conversation about their university destinations, when Cayetana brags about attending [[King’s College, London]] thanks to the close relationship of Polo’s mother with a Dean of the school.

Also, the neoclassical facade of King's, with the passage which connects the Strand to the [[Somerset House]] terrace has been utilised to reproduce the late Victorian Strand in the opening scenes of [[Oliver Parker]]'s 2002 film ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest (2002 film)|The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. The East Wing of King's appears, as a part of Somerset House, in a number of other productions, such as ''[[Wilde]]'', ''[[Flyboys (film)|Flyboys]]'', and ''[[The Duchess (film)|The Duchess]]''.<ref name=films>{{cite web |url=https://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/kings-in-film |title=King's on screen: film scenes around campus |publisher=Alumni Online|access-date=31 October 2015}}</ref>

The [[Maughan Library]] has also been the location of some film shoots of popular movies and TV series, most notably ''[[Johnny English]]'' (see [[Maughan Library]] description), ''[[The Imitation Game]]'', ''[[Enola Holmes (film)|Enola Holmes]]'' and ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]''.<ref name=films /> Corridors from Guy’s Campus were also used in the making of [[BBC]] series ''[[Killing Eve]] ''.

Part of [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' was set in the Round Reading Room of the [[Maughan Library]], although no part of the [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film adaption]] was filmed there.<ref>{{cite web |title=Round Reading Room |url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/library/library-newsletter-spring-2013.pdf |work=Library News |publisher=King's College London |date=Spring 2013}}</ref>

In September 1979, The Greenwood Theatre at Guy's Medical School (now King's [[GKT School of Medical Education|GKT Medical School]]) became the first home for the ''[[BBC|BBC's]]'' ''[[Question Time (TV programme)|Question Time]]'' programme.
