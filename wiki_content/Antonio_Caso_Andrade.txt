'''Antonio Caso Andrade''' (December 19, 1883&nbsp;&ndash; March 6, 1946) was a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[philosopher]] and rector of the former ''Universidad Nacional de México'', nowadays known as the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] from December 1921 to August 1923. Along with [[José Vasconcelos]], he founded the [[Ateneo de la Juventud]], a [[humanism|humanist]] group against philosophical positivism. The Athenian generation opposed [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]’s philosophical views, giving credence to and expanding on the ideas of  Henri Bergson, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and [[José Enrique Rodó]]. Caso opposed [[rationalism]]. His group the ''ateneistas'' believed in a moral, willing, and spiritual individual being.<ref>[http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/unijus/cmp/leguniv/rectores/r9.

==Philosophical Work==
In the summer of 1909, Caso presented his critiques of [[positivism]] in a series of conferences later expanded in the third edition by the Athenians of Youth. He was inspired by the [[Christianity|Christian]] philosophical tradition, in particular by [[Blaise Pascal]] and Tolstoy. Caso distinguishes three aspects of human existence: economic, aesthetic, and moral.  Caso refuted [[Gabino Barreda]]’s thesis and the first [[Justo Sierra]] that the future of Mexico was built primarily on basis of a scientific doctrine. In the work "[[Catholicism]], [[Jacobinism]] and Positivism" included in the book Discursos a la nacion mexicana (Discourses to the Mexican nation) Caso deepens his criticism of two of the hegemonic ideologies in the late nineteenth century: [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]] (or extreme liberalism) and positivism. The supporters of the first accuse them of ignoring reality, while those in the second get the blame for the alleged inevitability of reality. Antonio Caso is a pioneer in the Mexican philosophy that was developed later by [[Samuel Ramos]], [[Leopoldo Zea Aguilar]], and [[Octavio Paz]] among others. In his book ''El problema de México y la ideología nacional'', (The problem of Mexico and the nation ideology) published in 1924, Caso argues Mexico’s biggest problem is the lack of unity (racial, cultural and social). Towards the end of his life, Caso was influenced by the philosophies of Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger, especially Husserl, whose ideas were reflected in the book ''La filosofía de Husserl, El acto ideatorio, La persona humana y el estado totalitario y El peligro del hombre.'' (Husserl's philosophy, ideatory The act, The human person and the totalitarian state, and the danger of man).
