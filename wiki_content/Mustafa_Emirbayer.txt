== Career ==

Emirbayer was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], to parents of Turkish and Crimean Tatar descent. He also spent part of his childhood in [[Santa Barbara, California]], and his high school years in [[Mexico City, Mexico]].<ref name="Emirbayer's Bio">{{cite web|title=Emirbayer's Bio|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/BIO.html|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|access-date=July 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219081501/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/BIO.html|archive-date=February 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He attended the [[University of California, Davis]] and received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[psychology]] (with minors in English and History) in 1980. He originally enrolled in the graduate program in psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], where he first took coursework from the sociologist [[Charles Tilly]]. He soon realized that he wanted to study sociology as he felt psychology at the time neglected culture, institutions and history.<ref name="Emirbayer's Bio" /> Emirbayer went on to receive his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1985 and [[PhD]] in 1989 from [[Harvard University]], both in sociology. His dissertation was "Moral Education in American, 1830–1990" under the direction of [[Nathan Glazer]] (chair), [[Daniel Bell]], [[David Riesman]], and [[Theda Skocpol]].

Emirbayer attended Harvard shortly after the "[[Harrison White#The Harvard Revolution|revolution]]" in social network analysis,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.analytictech.com/mb119/chapt2a.htm|title=Chapter 2 -- intro}}</ref> and later at The New School, along with colleagues Charles Tilly and [[Harrison White]], he played a key role in [[relational sociology|The New York School of relational sociology]].<ref>https://ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/BIO.html</ref> In 2015, he became the [[editor-in-chief]] of the journal ''[[Sociological Theory (journal)|Sociological Theory]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/footnotes/septoct15/st_0915.html | title=Sociological Theory Welcomes New Editor Mustafa Emirbayer | publisher=American Sociological Association | work=Footnotes | date=September–October 2015 | access-date=7 May 2017 | author=Goldberg, Chad Alan}}</ref>

His most-cited publication, with [[Ann Mische]], is their 1998 article "What is Agency?"<ref>Emirbayer, Mustafa, and Ann Mische. "What is agency? 1." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 103.4 (1998): 962–1023. www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/231294</ref> In the article, the authors apply "relational pragmatics" to demonstrate the "dynamic interplay" of routine, purpose and judgement in explaining human [[Agency (sociology)|agency]].
