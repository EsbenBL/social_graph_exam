'''Harry Frederick Harlow''' (October 31, 1905 – December 6, 1981) was an American [[psychologist]] best known for his maternal-separation, dependency needs, and [[social isolation]] experiments on [[rhesus monkey]]s, which manifested the importance of caregiving and companionship to social and [[cognitive development]]. He conducted most of his research at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where [[humanistic psychology|humanistic psychologist]] [[Abraham Maslow]] worked with him for a short period of time.

Harlow's experiments were controversial; they included creating inanimate surrogate mothers for the rhesus infants from wire and wool. Each infant became attached to its particular mother, recognizing its unique face and preferring it above others. Harlow next chose to investigate if the infants had a preference for bare-wire mothers or cloth-covered mothers. For this experiment, he presented the infants with a clothed "mother" and a wire "mother" under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a bottle with food, and the cloth mother held no food. In the other situation, the cloth mother held the bottle, and the wire mother had nothing. Also later in his career, he cultivated infant monkeys in [[Pit of despair|isolation chambers]] for up to 24 months, from which they emerged intensely disturbed.<ref name="Harlow65">{{cite journal | last1=Harlow | first1=H.

==Biography==
Harry Harlow was born on October 31, 1905, to Mabel Rock and Alonzo Harlow Israel. Harlow was born and raised in Fairfield, Iowa, the third of four brothers.<ref name="McKinney">{{cite journal|last1=McKinney|first1=William T|year=2003|title=Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection|journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=160|issue=12|pages=2254–2255|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.12.2254}}</ref> After a year at [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], Harlow obtained admission to [[Stanford University]] through a special aptitude test. After a semester as an English major with nearly disastrous grades, he declared himself as a psychology major.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Suomi|first1=Stephen J.|date=8 August 2008|title=Rigorous Experiments on Monkey Love: An Account of Harry F. Harlow's Role in the History of Attachment Theory|journal=[[Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science]]|volume=42|issue=4|pages=354–69|doi=10.1007/s12124-008-9072-9|pmid=18688688|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Harlow attended Stanford in 1924, and subsequently became a graduate student in psychology, working directly under [[Calvin Perry Stone]], a well-known animal behaviorist, and [[Walter Richard Miles]], a vision expert, who were all supervised by [[Lewis Terman]].<ref name=McKinney /> Harlow studied largely under Terman, the developer of the [[Stanford-Binet IQ Test]], and Terman helped shape Harlow's future. After receiving a PhD in 1930, Harlow changed his name from Israel to Harlow.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rumbaugh|first1=Duane M.|title=The psychology of Harry F. Harlow: A bridge from radical to rational behaviorism|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume= 10|issue= 2|page=197|doi=10.1080/09515089708573215|year=1997}}</ref> The change was made at Terman's prompting for fear of the negative consequences of having a seemingly Jewish last name, even though his family was not Jewish.<ref name=McKinney />

Directly after completing his doctoral dissertation, Harlow accepted a professorship at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Harlow was unsuccessful in persuading the Department of Psychology to provide him with adequate laboratory space.  As a result, Harlow acquired a vacant building down the street from the University, and, with the assistance of his graduate students, renovated the building into what later became known as the Primate Laboratory,<ref name="Blum2002/225" /> one of the first of its kind in the world. Under Harlow's direction, it became a place of cutting-edge research at which some 40 students earned their PhDs.

Harlow received numerous awards and honors, including the [[Society of Experimental Psychologists|Howard Crosby Warren Medal]] (1956), the [[National Medal of Science]] (1967), and the Gold Medal from the American Psychological Foundation (1973). He served as head of the [[Human Resources]] Research branch of the Department of the Army from 1950–1952, head of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the National Research Council from 1952–1955, consultant to the Army [[Scientific Advisory Panel]], and president of the [[American Psychological Association]] from 1958–1959.

Harlow married his first wife, Clara Mears, in 1932. One of the select students with an IQ above 150 whom Terman studied at Stanford, Clara was Harlow's student before becoming romantically involved with him. The couple had two children together, Robert and Richard.  Harlow and Mears divorced in 1946. That same year, Harlow married child psychologist [[Margaret Kuenne Harlow|Margaret Kuenne]]. They had two children together, Pamela and Jonathan. Margaret died on 11 August 1971, after a prolonged struggle with [[cancer]], with which she had been diagnosed in 1967.<ref name=Blum>{{cite book|last1=Blum|first1=Deborah|title=Love at Goon Park: Harr Harlow and the science of affection|date=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465026012|page=228}}</ref> Her death led Harlow to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], for which he was treated with [[electro-convulsive therapy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.integratedsociopsychology.net/infant_monkeys-attachment.html |title=Keith E Rice - Attachment in Infant Monkeys |access-date=2012-05-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601044957/http://www.integratedsociopsychology.net/infant_monkeys-attachment.html |archive-date=2012-06-01 }} Key study: attachment in infant monkeys</ref> In March 1972, Harlow remarried Clara Mears.

==Monkey studies==
Harlow came to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1930<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van De Horst|first1=Frank|year=2008|title=When Strangers Meet": John Bowlby and Harry Harlow on Attachment Behavior|journal=[[Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science]]|volume=42|issue=4|pages=370–388|doi=10.1007/s12124-008-9079-2|pmid=18766423|doi-access=free}}</ref> after obtaining his doctorate under the guidance of several distinguished researchers, including Calvin Stone and Lewis Terman, at Stanford University. He began his career with nonhuman primate research. He worked with the primates at [[Henry Vilas Zoo]], where he developed the Wisconsin General Testing Apparatus (WGTA) to study learning, [[cognition]], and memory. It was through these studies that Harlow discovered that the monkeys he worked with were developing strategies for his tests. What would later become known as learning sets, Harlow described as "learning to learn."<ref name=Suomi>{{cite journal | last1 = Suomi | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Leroy | first2 = H. A. | year = 1982 | title = In memoriam: Harry F. Harlow (1905–1981) | journal = American Journal of Primatology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 319–342 | doi = 10.1002/ajp.1350020402 | pmid = 32188173 }}</ref>

[[File:Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) (5780783616).jpg|thumb|Harlow exclusively used rhesus macaques in his experiments.|215x215px]]

In order to study the development of these learning sets, Harlow needed access to developing primates, so he established a breeding colony of [[rhesus macaques]] in 1932. Due to the nature of his study, Harlow needed regular access to infant primates and thus chose to rear them in a nursery setting, rather than with their protective mothers.<ref name="Suomi" /> This alternative rearing technique, also called maternal deprivation, is highly controversial to this day, and is used, in variants, as a model of early life adversity in primates.
[[File:Natural_of_Love_Wire_and_cloth_mother_surrogates.jpg|thumb|276x276px|"Nature of love" wire and cloth mother surrogates]]
Research with and caring for infant rhesus monkeys further inspired Harlow, and ultimately led to some of his best-known experiments: the use of surrogate mothers. Although Harlow, his students, contemporaries, and associates soon learned how to care for the physical needs of their infant monkeys, the nursery-reared infants remained very different from their mother-reared peers. Psychologically speaking, these infants were slightly strange: they were reclusive, had definite social deficits, and clung to their cloth diapers.<ref name="Suomi" /> At the same time in the reverse configuration, babies that had grown up with only a mother and no playmates showed signs of fear or aggressiveness.<ref>{{cite web | title=A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: Harry Harlow | website=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/bhharl.html}}</ref>

Noticing their attachment to the soft cloth of their diapers and the psychological changes that correlated with the absence of a maternal figure, Harlow sought to investigate the mother–infant bond.<ref name="Suomi" /> This relationship was under constant scrutiny in the early twentieth century, as [[B. F. Skinner]] and the [[behaviorism|behaviorists]] took on [[John Bowlby]] in a discussion of the mother's importance in the development of the child, the nature of their relationship, and the impact of physical contact between mother and child.

The studies were motivated by John Bowlby's [[World Health Organization]]-sponsored study and report [[Maternal deprivation|"Maternal Care and Mental Health"]] in 1950, in which Bowlby reviewed previous studies on the effects of institutionalization on child development, and the distress experienced by children when separated from their mothers,<ref>{{cite web | last=Mcleod | first=Saul | title=Attachment Theory | website=Simply Psychology | date=February 5, 2008 | url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/attachment.html}}</ref> such as [[René Spitz]]'s<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spitz | first1 = R.

In 1953, his colleague [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] produced a short and controversial documentary film, titled ''A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital,'' demonstrating the almost-immediate effects of maternal separation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robert|first1=Karen|date=February 1990|title=Becoming attached|url=http://www.djeffrey.id.au/attachment_information_pages/Articles_files/Becoming%20Attached.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[The Atlantic Monthly]]|volume=265|issue=2|pages=35–70|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214083634/http://www.djeffrey.id.au/Attachment_Information_Pages/Articles_files/Becoming%20Attached.pdf|archive-date=14 December 2010|access-date=9 October 2014}}</ref> Bowlby's report, coupled with Robertson's film, demonstrated the importance of the primary caregiver in human and non-human primate development. Bowlby de-emphasized the mother's role in feeding as a basis for the development of a strong mother–child relationship, but his conclusions generated much debate. It was the debate concerning the reasons behind the demonstrated need for maternal care that Harlow addressed in his studies with surrogates. Physical contact with infants was considered harmful to their development, and this view led to sterile, contact-less nurseries across the country. Bowlby disagreed, claiming that the mother provides much more than food to the infant, including a unique bond that positively influences the child's development and mental health.

To investigate the debate, Harlow created inanimate surrogate mothers for the rhesus infants from wire and wood.<ref name=Suomi /> Each infant became attached to its particular mother, recognizing its unique face and preferring it above all others. Harlow next chose to investigate if the infants had a preference for bare-wire mothers or cloth-covered mothers. For this experiment, he presented the infants with a clothed mother and a wire mother under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a bottle with food, and the cloth mother held no food. In the other situation, the cloth mother held the bottle, and the wire mother had nothing.<ref name=Suomi />

Overwhelmingly, the infant macaques preferred spending their time clinging to the cloth mother.<ref name=Suomi /> Even when only the wire mother could provide nourishment, the monkeys visited her only to feed. Harlow concluded that there was much more to the mother–infant relationship than milk, and that this "contact comfort" was essential to the psychological development and health of infant monkeys and children. It was this research that gave strong, empirical support to Bowlby's assertions on the importance of love and mother–child interaction.

Successive experiments concluded that infants used the surrogate as a base for exploration, and a source of comfort and protection in novel and even frightening situations.<ref name="Harlow1958">{{cite journal | last=Harlow | first=Harry F. | title=The nature of love. | journal=American Psychologist | publisher=American Psychological Association (APA) | volume=13 | issue=12 | year=1958 | issn=0003-066X | doi=10.1037/h0047884 | pages=673–685 |url=https://www3.canyons.edu/faculty/rafterm/0%200LLI%20LOVEandLOSS/Day%20Files/Day%201%20Files/1958%20-%20The%20Nature%20of%20Love%20-%20Harlow.pdf}}</ref> In an experiment called the "[[Open field (animal test)|open-field test]]", an infant was placed in a novel environment with novel objects. When the infant's surrogate mother was present, it clung to her, but then began venturing off to explore. If frightened, the infant ran back to the surrogate mother and clung to her for a time before venturing out again. Without the surrogate mother's presence, the monkeys were paralyzed with fear, huddling in a ball and sucking their thumbs.<ref name=Harlow1958 />

In the "fear test", infants were presented with a fearful stimulus, often a noise-making teddy bear.<ref name=Harlow1958 /> Without the mother, the infants cowered and avoided the object. When the surrogate mother was present, however, the infant did not show great fearful responses and often contacted the device—exploring and attacking it.

Another study looked at the differentiated effects of being raised with only either a wire-mother or a cloth-mother.<ref name=Harlow1958 /> Both groups gained weight at equal rates, but the monkeys raised on a wire-mother had softer stool and trouble digesting the milk, frequently suffering from [[diarrhea]]. Harlow's interpretation of this behavior, which is still widely accepted, was that a lack of [[Comfort|contact comfort]] is psychologically stressful to the monkeys, and the digestive problems are a physiological manifestation of that stress.<ref name=Harlow1958 />

The importance of these findings is that they contradicted both the traditional pedagogic advice of limiting or avoiding bodily contact in an attempt to avoid spoiling children, and the insistence of the predominant behaviorist school of psychology that emotions were negligible. Feeding was thought to be the most important factor in the formation of a mother–child bond. Harlow concluded, however, that nursing strengthened the mother–child bond because of the intimate body contact that it provided. He described his experiments as a study of [[love]]. He also believed that contact comfort could be provided by either mother or father. Though widely accepted now, this idea was revolutionary at the time in provoking thoughts and values concerning the studies of love.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rumbaugh|first1=Duane|title=The psychology of Harry F. Harlow: A bridge from radical to rational behaviorism|journal=Philosophical Psychology|date=June 1997|volume= 10|issue= 2|pages=197–210|doi=10.1080/09515089708573215}}</ref>

Some of Harlow's final experiments explored [[social deprivation]] in the quest to create an animal model for the study of depression. This study is the most controversial, and involved isolation of infant and juvenile macaques for various periods of time. Monkeys placed in isolation exhibited social deficits when introduced or re-introduced into a peer group. They appeared unsure of how to interact with their [[conspecific]]s, and mostly stayed separate from the group, demonstrating the importance of social interaction and stimuli in forming the ability to interact with conspecifics in developing monkeys, and, comparatively, in children.

Critics of Harlow's research have observed that clinging is a matter of survival in young rhesus monkeys, but not in humans, and have suggested that his conclusions, when applied to humans, overestimate the importance of contact comfort and underestimate the importance of nursing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mason |first=W.A. |chapter=Early social deprivation in the nonhuman primates: Implications for human behavior |pages=70–101 |editor=D.

Harlow first reported the results of these experiments in "The Nature of Love", the title of his address to the sixty-sixth Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association in Washington, D.C., August 31, 1958.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Christopher D. |title=The Nature of Love |url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Harlow/love.htm |publisher=Classics in the History of Psychology |date=March 2000}}</ref>

===Partial and total isolation of infant monkeys===
Beginning in 1959, Harlow and his students began publishing their observations on the effects of partial and total social isolation. Partial isolation involved raising monkeys in bare wire cages that allowed them to see, smell, and hear other monkeys, but provided no opportunity for physical contact. Total social isolation involved rearing monkeys in isolation chambers that precluded any and all contact with other monkeys.

Harlow ''et al.'' reported that partial isolation resulted in various abnormalities such as blank staring, stereotyped repetitive circling in their cages, and self-mutilation. These monkeys were then observed in various settings. For the study, some of the monkeys were kept in solitary isolation for 15 years.<ref>A variation of this housing method, using cages with solid sides as opposed to wire mesh, but retaining the one-cage, one-monkey scheme, remains a common housing practice in primate laboratories today. {{cite journal | last1 = Reinhardt | first1 = V | last2 = Liss | first2 = C | last3 = Stevens | first3 = C | year = 1995 | title = Social Housing of Previously Single-Caged Macaques: What are the options and the Risks? |publisher=Universities Federation for Animal Welfare | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 4 | pages = 307–328 }}</ref>

In the total isolation experiments, baby monkeys would be left alone for three, six, 12, or 24<ref>{{cite book |last=Harlow |first=H.F. |chapter=Development of affection in primates |pages=157–166 |title=Roots of Behavior |editor-first=E.L. |editor-last=Bliss |location=New York |publisher=Harper |year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Harlow|first=H.F.|title=Unfinished tasks in the behavioral sciences|publisher=Williams & Wilkins|year=1964|editor-last=A.Abrams|location=Baltimore|pages=154–173|chapter=Early social deprivation and later behavior in the monkey|editor-last2=H.H.

{{Quotation|No monkey has died during isolation. When initially removed from total social isolation, however, they usually go into a state of emotional shock, characterized by ... autistic self-clutching and rocking. One of six monkeys isolated for 3 months refused to eat after release and died 5 days later. The autopsy report attributed death to emotional anorexia.
... The effects of 6 months of total social isolation were so devastating and debilitating that we had assumed initially that 12 months of isolation would not produce any additional decrement. This assumption proved to be false; 12 months of isolation almost obliterated the animals socially ...<ref name="Harlow65" />}}

Since Harlow's pioneering work on touch research in development, recent work in rats has found evidence that touch during infancy resulted in a decrease in [[corticosteroid]], a steroid hormone involved in stress, and an increase in [[glucocorticoid]] receptors in many regions of the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowFulltext&ProduktNr=224107&Ausgabe=229365&ArtikelNr=71465|title=Postnatal Touch Stimulation Acutely Alters Corticosterone Levels and Glucocorticoid Receptor Gene Expression in the Neonatal Rat|first1=N.|last1=Jutapakdeegul|first2=Stefano O.|last2=Casalotti|first3=P.|last3=Govitrapong|first4=N.|last4=Kotchabhakdi|date=5 November 2017|journal=Developmental Neuroscience|volume=25|issue=1|pages=26–33|doi=10.1159/000071465|pmid=12876428|s2cid=31348253}}</ref> Schanberg and Field found that even short-term interruption of mother–pup interaction in rats markedly affected several biochemical processes in the developing pup: a reduction in [[ornithine decarboxylase]] (ODC) activity, a sensitive index of cell growth and differentiation; a reduction in [[growth hormone]] release (in all body organs, including the heart and liver, and throughout the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem); an increase in [[corticosterone]] secretion; and suppressed tissue ODC responsivity to administered growth hormone.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schanberg |first1=S |last2=Field |first2=T. |chapter=Maternal deprivation and supplemental stimulation |title=Stress and Coping Across Development |editor-last1=Field |editor-first1=T |editor-last2=McCabe |editor-first2=P |editor-last3=Schneiderman |editor-first3=N |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum |year=1988}}</ref> Additionally, it was found that animals who are touch-deprived have weakened immune systems.

===Pit of despair===
{{Main|Pit of despair}}

Harlow was well known for refusing to use conventional terminology, instead choosing deliberately outrageous terms for the experimental apparatus he devised. This came from an early conflict with the conventional psychological establishment in which Harlow used the term "love" in place of the popular and archaically correct term "attachment". Such terms and respective devices included a forced-mating device he called the "rape rack", tormenting surrogate-mother devices he called "[[Iron maiden]]s", and an isolation chamber he called the "[[pit of despair]]", developed by him and a graduate student, [[Stephen Suomi]].

In the last of these devices, alternatively called the "well of despair", baby monkeys were left alone in darkness for up to one year from birth, or repetitively separated from their peers and isolated in the chamber. These procedures quickly produced monkeys that were severely psychologically disturbed, which were used as models of human depression.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Suomi |first=JS |title=Experimental production of depressive behavior in young monkeys |type=Doctoral thesis. |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison |year=1971}}</ref>

Harlow tried to rehabilitate monkeys that had been subjected to varying degrees of isolation using various forms of therapy. "In our study of psychopathology, we began as sadists trying to produce abnormality. Today, we are psychiatrists trying to achieve normality and equanimity."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harlow |first1=H. F. |last2=Harlow |first2=M. K. |last3=Suomi |first3=S.

==Criticism==
Many of Harlow's experiments are now considered [[ethics|unethical]]—in their nature as well as Harlow's descriptions of them—and they both contributed to heightened awareness of the treatment of laboratory animals, and helped propel the creation of today's ethics regulations. The monkeys in the experiment were deprived of maternal affection, potentially leading to what are now known as [[Panic disorder|panic disorders]].<ref name="Rosenblum">{{cite web | title=A Critique of Maternal Deprivation Monkey Experiments at The State University of New York Health Science Center | website=Medical Research Modernization Committee | url=http://www.mrmcmed.org/mom.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023215056/http://www.mrmcmed.org/mom.html | archive-date=October 23, 2007 | url-status=dead}}</ref>  [[University of Washington]] professor Gene Sackett, one of Harlow's doctoral students, stated that Harlow's experiments provided the impetus for the [[animal liberation movement]] in the U.S.<ref name="Blum2002/225"/>

William Mason, another one of Harlow's students who continued conducting deprivation experiments after leaving Wisconsin,<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Capitanio | first1=John P. | last2=Mason | first2=William A. | title=Cognitive style: Problem solving by rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) reared with living or inanimate substitute mothers. | journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology | publisher=American Psychological Association (APA) | volume=114 | issue=2 | year=2000 | issn=1939-2087 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.114.2.115 | pages=115–125 |pmid=10890583}}</ref> has said that Harlow "kept this going to the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities, that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive. It's as if he sat down and said, 'I'm only going to be around another ten years. What I'd like to do, then, is leave a great big mess behind.' If that was his aim, he did a perfect job."<ref name="Blum1994/96">{{cite book |last=Blum |first=Deborah |title=The Monkey Wars |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |page=96}}</ref>

[[Stephen Suomi]], a former Harlow student who now conducts maternal deprivation experiments on monkeys at the [[National Institutes of Health]], has been criticized by [[PETA]] and members of the U.S. Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Firger|first1=Jessica|title=Questions raised about mental health studies on baby monkeys at NIH labs|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mental-health-experiments-on-baby-monkeys-at-federal-nih-labs/|website=CBSNew.com|publisher=CBS|access-date=6 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Novak|first1=Bridgett|title=Animal research at NIH lab challenged by members of Congress|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nih-ethics-baby-monkeys-idUSKBN0K300120141225|newspaper=Reuters | access-date=6 January 2015|date=2014-12-25}}</ref>

Yet another of Harlow's students, Leonard Rosenblum, also went on to conduct maternal deprivation experiments with bonnet and pigtail macaque monkeys, and other research, involving exposing monkeys to drug–maternal-deprivation combinations in an attempt to "model" human panic disorder. Rosenblum's research, and his justifications for it, have also been criticized.<ref name=Rosenblum/>

==Theatrical portrayal==
A theatrical play, ''The Harry Harlow Project'', based on the life and work of Harlow, has been produced in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and performed nationally in Australia.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2009/11/29/1259429301627.html| title= ''The Harry Harlow Project'' | publisher= The Age: Arts Review | date= 30 November 2009 | access-date= 12 August 2011}}</ref>
