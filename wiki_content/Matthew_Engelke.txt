== Works ==
Engelke is the author of three books. His first book, ''A Problem of Presence: Beyond Scripture in An African church'', published in 2007, is a study of the Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe (founded by [[Johane Masowe]]). The text focuses on how the rejection of biblical textual authority creates a situation where certain semiotic forms of speech and song are understood by believers as 'live and direct' expressions of divine presence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Masondo|first=Sibusiso|title=A Problem of Presence: Beyond Scripture in an African Church.

His second book, ''God's Agents: Biblical Publicity in Contemporary England'', published in 2013, is an ethnography of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] and focuses on how the charitable organization worked to 'publicize' the Bible in an effectively secular nation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Handman|first=Courtney|title=God’s Agents: Biblical Publicity in Contemporary England by Matthew Engelke (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/545600/summary?casa_token=-kU2lhLoOhcAAAAA:r5PNC8xFWcapC9IxSGp5KS-jWnjhV1TkVlNQCuitx83T1xShj9XBO96WyQc0C6WIT_BcRTXc|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=87|pages=555-561|via=Project Muse}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Engelke|first=Matthew|title=God’s Agents: Biblical Publicity in Contemporary England|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|isbn=9780520280465|location=Oakland, California.}}</ref>

The novel is an introduction to anthropology for non-specialists and stresses the importance of learning "to think critically about our own assumptions regarding people across the globe who may seem exotic to us" by avoiding "exoticizing these 'others'" without "reducing cultural differences to the point of inconsequence."<ref>{{Cite web|title='How To Think Like An Anthropologist' — And Why You Should Want To|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2018/02/13/585373063/how-to-think-like-an-anthropologist-and-why-you-should-want-to|access-date=2021-06-18|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref>
