Born in the [[Free City of Danzig]] (Gdańsk) to [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] parents, Rosovsky grew up speaking Russian, German, and French.<ref name="tough love">{{cite web|last=Dawidoff|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Dawidoff|title=Tough Love|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/07/tough-love.html|work=Harvard Magazine|accessdate=August 19, 2011|date=July–August 2002}}</ref> At age 13, Rosovsky came to the United States in 1940 with his family. In 1949, he received his A.B. degree from the [[College of William and Mary]] and his Ph.D. degree from Harvard in 1959. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1949.<ref name="Who's Who" /> 

Rosovsky served in the US Army from 1946 to 1947 and again from 1950 to 1952. He taught economics, history and Japanese studies at the [[Uc berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] until 1965. He has taught as a visiting professor in [[Japan]] and [[Israel]] and has worked as a consultant with the United States government, the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[World Bank]] and [[UNESCO]].

In 2000, Rosovsky chaired the Task Force on Higher Education and Society with [[Mamphela Ramphele]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.tfhe.net/|website=www.tfhe.net|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref> The Task Force was convened by the [[World Bank]] and [[UNESCO]] to explore the future of higher education in developing countries. Its report, ''Peril and Promise'', argued that higher education systems in poor countries are in crisis and made a case for renewed investment, curricular reform and improved standards of [[governance]].

Rosovsky is the author of ''Capital Formation in Japan'' (1961), ''Quantitative Japanese Economic History'' (1961),'' Japanese Economic Growth'' (with K. Ohkawa, 1973) and ''[https://www.amazon.com/University-Owners-Manual-Henry-Rosovsky/dp/0393307832 The University: An Owner's Manual]'' (1990).<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Rosovsky|title=The University: An Owner's Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08kidV-XqL4C|year=1991|publisher=W.W.

Patrick, 1976), ''Favorites of Fortune'' (with P. Higonnet and [[David Landes|D. Landes]], 1991)'' and The Political Economy of Japan: Cultural and Social Dynamics'' (with Shumpei Kumon, 1992).

Thomas Short of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine praised ''The University'' as "a cozy book" where Rosovsky, with "a humorous, relentlessly self-deprecating manner," and shares "many anecdotes from his own career in higher education."<ref>{{cite web|last=Short|first=Thomas|title=The University: An Owner's Manual, by Henry Rosovsky|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-university-an-owners-manual-by-henry-rosovsky/|work=Commentary|accessdate=August 19, 2011|date=July 1990}}</ref>
