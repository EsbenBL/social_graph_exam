'''Seymour Martin Lipset''' (March 18, 1922 – December 31, 2006) was an [[US|American]] [[sociologist]]. His major work was in the fields of political sociology, [[trade union]] organization, [[social stratification]], public opinion, and the sociology of intellectual life.

At his death in 2006, ''The Guardian'' called him "the leading theorist of democracy and [[American exceptionalism]]"; ''The New York Times'' said he was "a pre-eminent sociologist, political scientist and incisive theorist of American uniqueness"; and the ''Washington Post'' said he was "one of the most influential social scientists of the past half century."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McGovern |first1=Patrick |title=The young Lipset on the iron law of oligarchy: a taste of things to come |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |date=14 January 2010 |volume=61 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2009.01283.x |pmid=20092476|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/35308/1/The%20young%20Lipset%20on%20the%20iron%20law%20of%20oligarchy%20%28LSERO%29.pdf |doi-access=free }}</ref>

He grew up in the Bronx among Irish, Italian and Jewish youth. "I was in that atmosphere where there was a lot of political talk," Lipset recalled, "but you never heard of Democrats or Republicans; the question was communists, socialists, Trotskyists, or anarchists. It was all sorts of different left wing groups." From an early age, Seymour was active in the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]], "an organization of young Trotskyists that he would later head."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=G. |first1=Jesús Velasco |title=Seymour Martin Lipset: Life and Work |journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology |date=2004 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=583–601 |doi=10.2307/3654712 |jstor=3654712}}</ref>   He graduated from [[City College of New York]], where he was an [[anti-Stalinist left]]ist,.<ref name="JPost remembering" />  He received a PhD in sociology from [[Columbia University]] in 1949.
