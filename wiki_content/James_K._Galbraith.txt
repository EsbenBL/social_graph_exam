'''James Kenneth Galbraith''' (born January 29, 1952) is an American [[economist]]. He is currently a professor at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]] and at the Department of Government, [[University of Texas at Austin]]. He is also a Senior Scholar with the [[Levy Economics Institute]] of [[Bard College]] and part of the executive committee of the World Economics Association, created in 2011.

== Background ==
Galbraith is a son of the renowned Canadian-American economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and  [[Catherine Galbraith|Catherine (Kitty) Atwater Galbraith]] and is the brother of the former diplomat, commentator and 2016 Vermont gubernatorial candidate [[Peter W. Galbraith]]. He earned his BA, magna cum laude, from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1974 and PhD from Yale in 1981, both in [[economics]].  From 1974 to 1975, Galbraith studied as a [[Marshall Scholar]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref name=home>{{Citation | url = http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/faculty/galbraith.html | title = James K. Galbraith | type = home page | publisher = U Texas | access-date = March 1, 2010}}.</ref>

==Career==
From 1981 to 1982, Galbraith served on the staff of the [[Congress of the United States]], eventually as Executive Director of the Joint Economic Committee.<ref name=home/>  In 1985, he was a guest scholar at the [[Brookings Institution]].<ref name=home />

Galbraith is currently a professor at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]] and at the Department of Government, [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Galbraith heads up the ''University of Texas Inequality Project'' (''UTIP''), which has been described by economic historian [[Robert Skidelsky|Lord Skidelsky]] as "pioneering inequality measurement".<ref name = "return">{{cite book | author-link = Robert Skidelsky | first = Robert | last = Skidelsky | title = Keynes: The return of the Master | year = 2009 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/keynesreturnofma0000skid/page/124 124, 125] | isbn = 978-1-84614-258-1 | publisher = Allen Lane | url = https://archive.org/details/keynesreturnofma0000skid/page/124 }}</ref> ''UTIP'' is also noted for replacing the established [[Gini coefficient]] with the [[Theil index]] as the measurement of choice for comparing inequality between groups, regions and countries.<ref name = "return" />

In March 2008 Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack on the [[Washington Consensus]] on [[free market]] policies, especially the [[monetarism|monetarist]] version.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://utip.gov.utexas.edu/papers/CollapseofMonetarismdelivered.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | title = The Collapse of Monetarism and the Irrelevance of the New Monetary Consensus | publisher = The University of Texas | first = James K | last = Galbraith | access-date =February 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317221852/http://utip.gov.utexas.edu/papers/CollapseofMonetarismdelivered.pdf |archive-date=March 17, 2009}}</ref> He argued strongly that Keynesian economics offered a solution to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis that started in 2007]] whereas monetarist policies would deepen the recession. Towards the end of 2008 and into 2009 many policymakers around the world increased government spending and/or cut taxes, arguably in line with Galbraith’s views, as part of the  [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|Keynesian resurgence]] described  by the ''Financial Times'' as "a stunning reversal of the orthodoxy of the past several decades".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ft.com/content/8a3d8122-d5da-11dd-a9cc-000077b07658 | title = The undeniable shift to Keynes | publisher = The Financial Times | first1 = Chris | last1 = Giles | first2 = Ralph | last2 = Atkins | first3 = Krishna | last3 = Guha | location = London, Frankfurt, Washington | access-date =January 23, 2008}}</ref>

In 2010 he edited an edition of his father's works for the  [[Library of America]] series.<ref>{{Citation | first = John Kenneth | last = Galbraith | title = The Affluent Society and Other Writings 1952–1967 | editor-first = James K | editor-last = Galbraith | place = New York | publisher = The Library of America | year = 2010 | ISBN = 978-1-59853-077-3}}</ref>

== Writings ==
Galbraith's books include {{Citation | title = Balancing Acts: Technology, Finance and the American Future | year = 1989}}; {{Citation | title = Created Unequal: The Crisis in American Pay | year = 1998}}; {{Citation | title = Inequality and Industrial Change: A Global View | year = 2001}}, co-edited with Maureen Berner; and {{Citation | title = [[The Predator State]] | year = 2008}}. He is the author of two textbooks – {{Citation | title = The Economic Problem}} (with [[Robert L. Heilbroner]]) and {{Citation | title = Macroeconomics}} (with [[William Darity Jr.]])

He also contributes a column to {{Citation | title = [[The Texas Observer]]}} and writes regularly for {{Citation | title = [[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]}}, {{Citation | title = [[The American Prospect]]}}, {{Citation | title = [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]}}, and {{Citation | title = [[The Progressive]]}}. His op-ed pieces have appeared in {{Citation | title = [[The New York Times]]}}, {{Citation | title = The [[Washington Post]]}}, {{Citation | title = [[Boston Globe]]}} and other  newspapers.

Galbraith argues that modern America has fallen prey to a wealthy, government-controlling "predatory class":
{{quote |Today, the signature of modern American capitalism is neither benign competition, nor class struggle, nor an inclusive middle-class utopia. Instead, predation has become the dominant feature — a system wherein the rich have come to feast on decaying systems built for the middle class. The predatory class is not the whole of the wealthy; it may be opposed by many others of similar wealth. But it is the defining feature, the leading force. And its agents are in full control of the government under which we live.<ref>{{cite web | first = James K | last = Galbraith |url= https://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2006/05/predator_state.html | title= Predator State |date=June 2006 |publisher=Mother Jones |access-date=May 6, 2009}}</ref>}}

Galbraith is also highly critical of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration's foreign policy apropos of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq invasion]]:
{{quote |There is a reason for the vulnerability of empires. To maintain one against opposition requires war — steady, unrelenting, unending war. And war is ruinous — from a legal, moral and economic point of view. It can ruin the losers, such as Napoleonic France, or Imperial Germany in 1918. And it can ruin the victors, as it did the British and the Soviets in the 20th century. Conversely, Germany and Japan recovered well from World War II, in part because they were spared reparations and did not have to waste national treasure on defense in the aftermath of defeat...  The real economic cost of Bush's empire building is twofold: It diverts attention from pressing economic problems at home and it sets the United States on a long-term imperial path that is economically ruinous.}}

Much like [[John Kenneth Galbraith|his father]] in writing ''[[A Tenured Professor]]'', the junior Galbraith is also a critic of his own profession:
{{Quote |Leading active members of today's economics profession, the generation presently in their 40s and 50s, have joined together into a kind of politburo for correct economic thinking. As a general rule — as one might expect from a gentleman's club — this has placed them on the wrong side of every important policy issue, and not just recently but for decades. They predict disaster where none occurs.  They deny the possibility of events that then happen. They offer a "rape is like the weather" fatalism about an "inevitable" problem (pay inequality) that then starts to recede.  They oppose the most basic, decent, and sensible reforms, while offering placebos instead.  They are always surprised when something untoward (like a recession) actually occurs. And when finally they sense that some position cannot be sustained, they do not re-examine their ideas. Instead, they simply change the subject.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_economists_got_it_wrong | title = How the Economists got it wrong | publisher = Prospect | date = November 30, 2002 | access-date = May 6, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810202347/http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_economists_got_it_wrong | archive-date = August 10, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>}}

== Humanitarian initiatives ==
Galbraith is the Chairman of [[Economists for Peace and Security]], formerly known as Economists Against the Arms Race and later Economists Allied for Arms Reduction (ECAAR), an international association of professional economists concerned with peace and security issues.

In 2009, he joined the project for ''[[Steve Killelea|Soldiers of Peace]]'', a documentary for global peace and against all wars,  which has won various awards in film festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofpeacemovie.com/about/the-cast/23/james-galbraith/ |title=James K.
