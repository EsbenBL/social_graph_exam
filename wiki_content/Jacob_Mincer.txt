'''Jacob Mincer''' (July 15, 1922 – August 20, 2006), was a father of modern [[labor economics]]. He was [[Joseph L. Buttenwieser]] Professor of Economics and Social Relations at [[Columbia University]] for most of his active life.

==Biography==
Born in [[Tomaszów Lubelski]], [[Poland]], Mincer survived World War II [[internment|prison camps]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Germany]] as a teenager.  After graduating from [[Emory University]] in 1950, Mincer received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]] in 1957.

Following teaching stints at [[City College of New York]], [[Hebrew University]], [[Stockholm School of Economics]] and the [[University of Chicago]], Mincer joined Columbia's faculty where he stayed until his retirement in 1991.

Mincer was also a member of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] from 1960 through his death.

Mincer died at his [[Manhattan]] home on August 20, 2006, due to complications from [[Parkinson's disease]], according to his wife, Dr. Flora Mincer, and his daughters, Deborah Mincer (Sussman) and Carolyn Mincer.

==Contributions to economic science==
Mincer was considered by many to be a father of modern [[labor economics]].<ref name="Grossbard on Mincer">Shoshana Grossbard (ed.), Jacob Mincer, A Pioneer of Modern Labor Economics. New York: Springer, 2006.</ref><ref name="Columbia News">{{cite web |title=Remembered: Jacob Mincer, Father of Modern Labor Economics |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/06/09/mincer.html |date=September 1, 2006 |work=Columbia News }}</ref> As a leading member of a group of economists known as the [[Chicago School of Economics]], Mincer and Nobel Laureate [[Gary Becker]] helped to develop the empirical foundations of [[human capital]] theory, consequently revolutionizing the field of labor economics.

During his academic career, Mincer authored four books and hundreds of journal articles, papers and essays.  Mincer's ground-breaking work: ''Schooling, Experience and Earnings'', published in 1974, used data from the 1950 and 1960 Censuses to relate income distribution in America to the varying amounts of education and on-the-job training among workers. "He calculated, for example, that annual earnings rose by 5 to 10 percent in the 1950s and 1960s for every year of additional schooling. There was a similar, although smaller, return on investment in job training—and age played a role."<ref name="New York Times Obit">{{cite news |first=Louis |last=Uchitelle | author-link = Louis Uchitelle |title=Jacob Mincer, 84, Pioneer On Labor Economics, Dies |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E6D7123EF930A1575BC0A9609C8B63 |work=New York Times |date=August 23, 2006 }}</ref>

Mincer's work continues to have a profound impact on the field of labor economics.  Papers in the field frequently use [[Mincerian equations]], which model wages as a function of [[human capital]] in [[statistical estimation]].  And as a result of Mincer's pioneering work, variables such as schooling and work experience are now the most commonly used measures of human capital.

==Awards and prizes==
In 1967 Mincer was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-08-20.</ref>

In 1991, he received an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from the [[University of Chicago]] which recognized his seminal work in the economic analysis of earnings and [[Economic inequality|inequality]], the [[labor force]] decisions of women and of [[Job (role)|job]] mobility. The citation for the degree also recognized Mincer's work in this area that has helped guide a generation of economists who study these important social questions.

In recognition of his lifetime achievements in economics, Mincer was awarded the first [[Institute for the Study of Labor#IZA Prize in Labor Economics|IZA Prize in Labor Economics]] of the [[Institute for the Study of Labor]] ([[Bonn]], Germany). The $50,000 prize was presented to Mincer by more than 100 of his former students at a conference at Columbia University in 2002.

In 2004 Mincer received a Career Achievement Award from the University of Chicago's Society of Labor Economists; the annual award has subsequently become known as the [[Jacob Mincer Award|Mincer Award]].

Mincer was never awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]], though he was considered one of the world's greatest economists of the 20th century, and was nominated for the award numerous times by admiring colleagues.
