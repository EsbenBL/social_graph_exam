A '''clinician''' is a [[health care]] professional who works as a caregiver of a [[patient]] in a hospital, [[skilled nursing facility]], [[clinic]], or patient's home. Clinicians work directly with patients rather than in a laboratory or as a researcher.<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Clinician|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref> A clinician may diagnose, treat, and otherwise care for patients. For example, [[clinical pharmacists]], [[List of credentials in psychology|licensed clinical social workers (LCSW)]], [[nurses]], [[nurse practitioners]], [[dietitians]], [[occupational therapists]], [[speech-language pathologists]], physiotherapists, [[dentists]] , [[optometrists]] and [[physicians]] can be considered clinicians. Many clinicians take comprehensive exams to be licensed and some complete graduate degrees (master's or doctorates) in their field of expertise.

A main function of a clinician is to manage a sick person in order to cure the effects of their illness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=A.

The clinician can also consider the impact of illness upon the patient and his or her family, as well as other social factors.
