{{Short description|Application of psychological methods to the contents of religious traditions}}
{{Psychology sidebar|applied}}

'''Psychology of religion''' consists of the application of [[List of psychological research methods|psychological methods]] and interpretive frameworks to the diverse contents of [[Religion|religious]] traditions as well as to both religious and [[Irreligion|irreligious]] individuals. The extraordinary range of methods and frameworks can be helpfully summed up regarding the classic distinction between the [[Natural science|natural-scientific]] and human-scientific approaches. The first cluster proceeds by means of objective, quantitative, and preferably experimental procedures for testing hypotheses regarding the causal connections among the objects of one's study. In contrast, the human-scientific approach accesses the human world of experience using qualitative, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], and interpretive methods, with the goal of discerning meaningful rather than causal connections among the phenomena one seeks to understand.

[[Psychologist]]s of religion pursue three major projects: (1) systematic description, especially of religious contents, attitudes, experiences, and expressions; (2) explanation of the origins of religion, both in the history of the human race and in individual lives, taking into account a diversity of influences; and (3) mapping out the consequences of religious attitudes and conduct, both for the individual and for society at large. The [[psychology]] of religion first arose as a self-conscious discipline in the late 19th century, but all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.<ref name=" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732">Wulff, D. M. (2010). Psychology of Religion. In D. A. Leeming, K. Madden, & S. Marian (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (pp. 732–735). New York; London: Springer.</ref>

==Overview==
The challenge for the psychology of religion is essentially threefold: (1) to provide a thoroughgoing description of the objects of investigation, whether they be shared religious content (e.g., a tradition's ritual observances) or individual experiences, attitudes, or conduct; (2) to account in psychological terms for the rise of such phenomena, whether they be in individual lives; and (3) to clarify the outcomes—the fruits, as William James put it—of these phenomena, for individuals, and the larger society.<ref name=" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732"/> These fruits may be both positive and negative.

The first, descriptive task naturally requires a clarification of one's terms—above all, the word ''religion''. [[History of religion|Historians of religion]] have long underscored the problematic character of this term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally in the direction of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].<ref>Smith, W. C. (1963). ''The Meaning and End of Religion: A New Approach to the Religious Traditions of Mankind.'' New York: Macmillan.</ref> The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary.<ref>Wulff, D. M. (1999). Psychologists Define Religion: Patterns and Prospects of a Century-Long Quest. In J. G. Platvoet and A. L. Molendijk (Eds.), ''The Pragmatics of Defining Religion: Contexts, Concepts, and Contests'' (pp. 207–224). Leiden: Brill</ref> With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology over the course of the 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be operationalized by quantitative procedures, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians.<ref>Hill, P. C., and Hood, R. W., Jr. (Eds.). (1999). ''Measures of Religiosity." Birmingham, AL: Religious Education Press.</ref> [[Factor analysis]] was also brought into play by both psychologists and [[Sociology of religion|sociologists of religion]], to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other [[postmodern]] viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.

In the last several decades, especially among [[clinical psychologist]]s, a preference for the terms "spirituality" and "spiritual" has emerged, along with efforts to distinguish them from "religion" and "religious." Especially in the [[United States]], "religion" has for many become associated with sectarian institutions and their obligatory creeds and rituals, thus giving the word a negative cast; "[[spirituality]]," in contrast, is positively constructed as deeply individual and subjective, as a universal capacity to apprehend and accord one's life with higher realities.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Schlehofer M.

Today, efforts are ongoing to "[[operationalization|operationalize]]" these terms, with little regard for their history in their Western context, and with the apparent realist assumption that underlying them are fixed qualities identifiable using empirical procedures.<ref>Hill, P. C. (2005). Measurement in the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality: Current Status and Evaluation. In [[Raymond Paloutzian|R. F. Paloutzian]] & C. L. Park (Eds.), ''Handbook of the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality.'' New York, London: Guilford Press.</ref>

Schnitker and Emmons theorized that the understanding of religion as a search for meaning makes implications in the three psychological areas of motivation, cognition and social relationships. The cognitive aspects relate to God and a sense of purpose, the motivational ones to the need to control, and the religious search for meaning is also woven into social communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Spiritual striving and seeking the sacred: religion as meaningful goal-directed behavior.|last = Schnitker|first = Sarah|date = 2013|journal = The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|doi = 10.1080/10508619.2013.795822|volume=23|issue = 4|pages=315–324|s2cid = 144746762}}</ref>

==History==
{{More footnotes|date=January 2012}}

=== William James ===
American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842–1910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion as the founder of the field.<ref>Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger and Gorsuch, 2003, The Psychology of Religion, p. 24</ref> He served as president of the [[American Psychological Association]], and wrote one of the first psychology textbooks. In the psychology of religion, James' influence endures. His ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience|Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James' ideas are common at professional conferences.

James distinguished between [[institutional religion]] and personal religion. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has [[mystical experience]], can be experienced regardless of the culture. James was most interested in understanding personal religious experience.

In studying personal [[religious experience]]s, James made a distinction between ''healthy-minded'' and ''sick-souled'' religiousness. Individuals predisposed to healthy-mindedness tend to ignore the evil in the world and focus on the positive and the good. James used examples of [[Walt Whitman]] and the "[[mind-cure]]" religious movement to illustrate healthy-mindedness in ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''. In contrast, individuals predisposed to having a sick-souled religion are unable to ignore evil and suffering and need a unifying experience, religious or otherwise, to reconcile good and evil. James included quotations from [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[John Bunyan]] to illustrate the sick soul.

William James' hypothesis of [[pragmatism]] stems from the efficacy of religion. If an individual believes in and performs religious activities, and those actions happen to work, then that practice appears the proper choice for the individual. However, if the processes of religion have little efficacy, then there is no rationality for continuing the practice.

=== Other early theorists ===

==== G. W. F. Hegel ====
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) described all systems of religion, philosophy, and social science as expressions of the basic urge of consciousness to learn about itself and its surroundings, and record its findings and hypotheses. Thus, religion is only a form of that search for knowledge, within which humans record various experiences and reflections. Others, compiling and categorizing these writings in various ways, form the consolidated worldview as articulated by that religion, philosophy, social science, etc. His work [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]] was a study of how various types of writing and thinking draw from and re-combine with the individual and group experiences of various places and times, influencing the current forms of knowledge and worldviews that are operative in a population. This activity is the functioning of an incomplete group mind, where each is accessing the recorded wisdom of others. His works often include detailed descriptions of the psychological motivations involved in thought and behavior, e.g., the struggle of a community or nation to know itself and thus correctly govern itself. In Hegel's system, Religion is one of the major repositories of wisdom to be used in these struggles, representing a huge body of recollections from humanity's past in various stages of its development.

==== Sigmund Freud ====
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]. Back row: [[Abraham Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]].]] 
[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) gave explanations of the genesis of religion in his various writings. In ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', he applied the idea of the [[Oedipus complex]] (involving unresolved sexual feelings of, for example, a son toward his mother and hostility toward his father) and postulated its emergence in the primordial stage of human development.

In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', Freud reconstructed biblical history by his general theory. His ideas were also developed in ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]''. When Freud spoke of religion as an [[illusion]], he maintained that it "is a fantasy structure from which a man must be set free if he is to grow to maturity."

Freud views the idea of [[God]] as being a version of the [[father]] image, and religious belief as at bottom infantile and [[neurosis|neurotic]]. Authoritarian religion, Freud believed, is dysfunctional and alienates man from himself.

==== Carl Jung ====
The Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961) adopted a very different posture, one that was more sympathetic to religion and more concerned with a positive appreciation of [[religious symbolism]]. Jung considered the question of the metaphysical existence of God to be unanswerable by the psychologist and adopted a kind of [[agnosticism]].<ref>Jung, 'On the Nature of the Psyche,' C.W.8, Aphorisms 362, 420.</ref>

Jung postulated, in addition to the personal [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] (roughly adopting Freud's concept), the [[collective unconscious]], which is the repository of human experience and which contains "[[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]" (i.e. basic images that are universal in that they recur regardless of culture). The irruption of these images from the unconscious into the realm of consciousness he viewed as the basis of [[religious experience]] and often of artistic creativity. Some of Jung's writings have been devoted to elucidating some of the archetypal [[symbol]]s, and include his work in [[comparative mythology]].

==== Alfred Adler ====
Austrian psychiatrist [[Alfred Adler]] (1870–1937), who parted ways with Freud, emphasized the role of goals and motivation in his ''Individual Psychology''. One of Adler's most famous ideas is that we try to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions, God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.

Our ideas about [[God]] are important indicators of how we view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our vision of the world – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by [[natural selection]]. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way, our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.

An important thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and others. Our view of God is important because it embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.

Compared to [[science]], another social movement, [[religion]] is more efficient because it motivates people more effectively. According to Adler, only when science begins to capture the same religious fervor, and promotes the welfare of all segments of society, will the two be more equal in peoples' eyes.

==== Gordon Allport ====
In his classic book ''The Individual and His Religion'' (1950), [[Gordon Allport]] (1897–1967) illustrates how people may use religion in different ways.<ref name="Leak">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3852/is_200201/ai_n9029025/?tag=untagged|title=Exploratory factor analysis of the religious maturity scale|last=Leak|first=Gary K|year=2002|work=BNET UK|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|access-date=22 March 2010}}</ref> He makes a distinction between ''Mature religion'' and
''Immature religion''. Mature religious sentiment is how Allport characterized the person whose approach to religion is dynamic, open-minded, and able to maintain links between inconsistencies. In contrast, immature religion is [[vanity|self-serving]] and generally represents the negative stereotypes that people have about religion.
More recently, this distinction has been encapsulated in the terms "intrinsic religion", referring to a genuine, heartfelt devout [[faith]], and "extrinsic religion", referring to a more utilitarian use of religion as a means to an end, such as [[church attendance]] to gain [[social status]]. These dimensions of religion were measured on the [[Extrinsic religious orientation|Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and Ross (1967). The third form of religious orientation has been described by [[Daniel Batson]]. This refers to treatment of religion as an open-ended search (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).
More specifically, it has been seen by Batson as comprising a willingness to view religious doubts positively, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises that one has experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quests respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end, and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).

==== Erik H. Erikson ====
[[Erik Erikson]] (1902–1994) is best known for his theory of psychological development, which has its roots in the psychoanalytic importance of [[identity (social science)|identity]] in personality. His biographies of [[Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther]] reveal Erikson's positive view of religion. He considered religions to be important influences in successful [[personality development]] because they are the primary way that cultures promote the [[virtues]] associated with each stage of life. Religious [[ritual]]s facilitate this development. Erikson's theory has not benefited from systematic empirical study, but it remains an influential and well-regarded theory in the psychological study of religion.

==== Erich Fromm ====
The American scholar [[Erich Fromm]] (1900–1980) modified the Freudian theory and produced a more complex account of the functions of religion. In his book ''[[Psychoanalysis and Religion]]'' he responded to Freud's theories by explaining that part of the modification is viewing the [[Oedipus complex]] as based not so much on sexuality as on a "much more profound desire", namely, the childish desire to remain attached to protecting figures. The right religion, in Fromm's estimation, can, in principle, foster an individual's highest potentialities, but religion in practice tends to relapse into being neurotic.<ref name=PsyRel>{{cite book |last1=Fromm |first1=Erich |author-link1=Erich Fromm |title=Psychoanalysis and Religion |url=https://archive.org/details/psychoanalysisre00fromrich |url-access=registration |quote=psychoanalysis and religion. |access-date=10 February 2010 |year=1950 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven, CT, US |isbn=978-0-300-00089-4 }}</ref>

According to Fromm, humans need a stable frame of reference. Religion fills this need. In effect, humans crave answers to questions that no other source of knowledge has an answer to, which only religion may seem to answer. However, a sense of free will must be given for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.<ref name=Personality>{{cite book |title=Personality |last=Burger |first=Jerry |year=2007 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location=Stamford, CT, US |isbn=978-0-495-09786-0 |pages=122–123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvGH0J_wHggC&q=Fromm+Freud+Jung+religion |access-date=10 February 2010}}</ref>

==== Rudolf Otto ====
[[Rudolf Otto]] (1869–1937) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestant]] theologian and scholar of [[comparative religion]]. Otto's most famous work, ''[[The Idea of the Holy]]'' (published first in 1917 as ''Das Heilige''), defines the concept of the holy as that which is ''[[numinous]]''. Otto explained the numinous as a "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self." It is a mystery (Latin: ''mysterium tremendum'') that is both fascinating (''fascinans'') and terrifying at the same time; A mystery that causes trembling and fascination, attempting to explain that inexpressible and perhaps supernatural emotional reaction of [[Sense of wonder|wonder]] drawing us to seemingly ordinary and/or religious experiences of [[divine grace|grace]]. This sense of emotional wonder appears evident at the root of all religious experiences. Through this emotional wonder, we suspend our rational mind for non-rational possibilities.

''The Idea of the Holy'' also set out a [[paradigm]] for the study of religion that focuses on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was under much attack between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has made a strong comeback since then.

=== Modern thinkers ===
Autobiographal accounts of 20th-century psychology of religion as a field have been supplied by numerous modern psychologists of religion, primarily based in Europe, but also by several US-based psychologists such as [[Ralph W. Hood]] and [[Donald Eric Capps|Donald Capps]].<ref name=belzen2012>{{cite book|editor1-last=Belzen|editor1-first=Jacob A. |title=Psychology of religion: autobiographical accounts|date=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4614-1601-2 |oclc=773924284}}</ref>

==== James Hillman ====
[[James Hillman]], at the end of his book ''Re-Visioning Psychology'', reverses James' position of viewing religion through psychology, urging instead that we view psychology as a variety of religious experience. He concludes: "Psychology as religion implies imagining all psychological events as effects of Gods in the soul.<ref>James Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology, HarperCollins, NY, 1977, p227</ref>"

==== Julian Jaynes ====
[[Julian Jaynes]], primarily in his book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]'', proposed that religion (and some other psychological phenomena such as hypnosis and schizophrenia) is a remnant of a relatively recent time in human development, prior to the advent of consciousness. Jaynes hypothesized that hallucinated verbal commands helped non-conscious early man to perform tasks promoting human survival. Starting about 10,000 BCE, selective pressures favored the hallucinated verbal commands for social control, and they came to be perceived as an external, rather than internal, voice commanding the person to take some action. These were hence often explained as originating from invisible gods, spirits, ancestors, etc.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Jaynes | first=Julian | title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-618-05707-8 | pages=131–143}}</ref>

=== Cultural divide ===
In response to the religious transformation hypothesis, Ronald Inglehart piloted the renewal of the secularization hypothesis. His argument hinges on the premise that religion develops to fill the human need for security. Therefore, the development of social and economic security in Europe explains its corresponding secularization due to a lack of need for religion.<ref>{{cite book

The idea that [[religiosity]] arises from the human need for security has also been furthered by studies examining religious beliefs as a compensatory mechanism of control. These studies are motivated by the idea that people are invested in maintaining beliefs in order and structure to prevent beliefs in chaos and randomness<ref>{{Cite journal

In this study, researchers suggest that when a person's personal control is lessened, their motivation to believe in order is threatened, resulting in compensation of this threat through adherence to other external sources of control.

== Psychometric approaches to religion ==
Since the 1960s psychologists of religion have used the methodology of [[psychometrics]] to assess ways in which a person may be religious. An example is the [[Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and [[Michael Ross (psychologist)|Ross]],<ref>{{Cite journal
 | author = Allport, G.W. & [[Michael Ross (psychologist)|J. Michael Ross]]

The second measures three forms of religious orientation: religion as means (intrinsic), religion as end (extrinsic), and religion as quest. The third assesses spiritual maturity using two factors: Spiritual Support and Spiritual Openness.

===Religious orientations and religious dimensions===
{{Further|Sociology of religion}}
Some questionnaires, such as the [[Religious Orientation Scale]], relate to different religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion for the purpose of psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.

===Questionnaires to assess religious experience===
What we call religious experiences can differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings that it would be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.

An objectivist would argue that the religious experience is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how it was possible to tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.<ref>{{cite book

The Subjectivist view argues that it is not necessary to think of religious experiences as evidence for the existence of an actual being whom we call God. From this point of view, the important thing is the experience itself and the effect that it has on the individual.<ref>{{cite book

== Developmental approaches to religion ==
{{Main|James W. Fowler}}
{{Further|Psychology of religious conversion}}

Many have looked at stage models, like those of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], to explain how children develop ideas about God and religion in general.

===James Fowler's model===
The best-known stage model of spiritual or religious development is that of [[James W. Fowler]], a [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] at the [[Candler School of Theology]], in his ''Stages of Faith''.{{sfn|Evans|Forney|Guido|Patton|2010|p=196}} He follows Piaget and Kohlberg and has proposed a holistic staged development of [[faith]] (or spiritual development) across the lifespan. These [[stages of faith development]] were along the lines of Piaget's [[theory of cognitive development]] and Kohlberg's [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].{{sfn|Evans|Forney|Guido|Patton|2010|pp=196–197}}

The book-length study contains six stages of faith development proposed by James Fowler:

* Stage 0 – "Primal or Undifferentiated" faith (birth to 2 years), is characterized by an early learning of the safety of their environment (i.e. warm, safe and secure vs. hurt, neglect and abuse). If consistent nurture is experienced, one will develop a sense of trust and safety about the universe and the divine. Conversely, negative experiences will cause one to develop distrust about the universe and the divine. Transition to the next stage begins with integration of thought and language which facilitates the use of symbols in speech and play.
* Stage 1 – "Intuitive-Projective" faith (ages of three to seven), is characterized by the psyche's unprotected exposure to the [[Unconscious mind|Unconscious]], and marked by a relative fluidity of thought patterns.{{sfn|Wolski Conn|1986|pp=226–232}} Religion is learned mainly through experiences, stories, images, and the people that one comes in contact with.
* Stage 2 – "Mythic-Literal" faith (mostly in school children), is characterized by persons have a strong belief in the [[justice]] and reciprocity of the universe, and their [[deity|deities]] are almost always [[anthropomorphic]]. During this time [[metaphors]] and [[Symbolic language (literature)|symbolic language]] are often misunderstood and are taken literally.
* Stage 3 – "Synthetic-Conventional" faith (arising in adolescence; aged 12 to adulthood), is characterized by [[conformity]] to authority and the religious development of a personal identity. Any conflicts with one's beliefs are ignored at this stage due to the fear of threat from inconsistencies.
* Stage 4 – "Individuative-Reflective" faith (usually mid-twenties to late thirties), is a stage of [[angst]] and struggle. The individual takes personal responsibility for his or her [[belief]]s and [[feeling]]s. As one is able to reflect on one's own beliefs, there is an openness to a new complexity of faith, but this also increases the awareness of conflicts in one's belief.
* Stage 5 – "Conjunctive" faith (mid-life crisis), acknowledges paradox and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] relating reality behind the symbols of inherited systems. The individual resolves conflicts from previous stages by a complex understanding of a multidimensional, interdependent "truth" that cannot be explained by any particular statement.
* Stage 6 – "Universalizing" faith, or what some might call "[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]". The individual would treat any person with compassion as he or she views people as from a universal community, and should be treated with universal principles of love and justice.

Fowler's model has inspired a considerable body of empirical research into faith development, although little of such research was ever conducted by Fowler himself. Gary Leak's Faith Development Scale, or FDS, has been subject to [[factor analysis]] by Leak.{{sfn|Leak|2008}}

===Other hypotheses===
Other theorists in developmental psychology have suggested that religiosity comes naturally to young children. Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies. In addition, children have a tendency to see agency and human design where there is not, and prefer a creationist explanation of the world even when raised by parents who do not.<ref>{{Cite journal

Researchers have also investigated attachment system dynamics as a predictor of the religious conversion experience throughout childhood and adolescence. One hypothesis is the correspondence hypothesis,<ref>{{Cite journal
 | author=Bloom, P. |date=January 2007
 | title=Religion is natural
 | journal = Developmental Science |volume= 10

 }}</ref> which posits that individuals with secure parental attachment are more likely to experience a gradual conversion experience. Under the correspondence hypothesis, internal working models of a person's attachment figure is thought to perpetuate his or her perception of God as a secure base. Another hypothesis relating attachment style to the conversion experience is the compensation hypothesis,<ref>{{Cite journal

 | jstor = 1386461
 }}</ref> which states that individuals with insecure attachments are more likely to have a sudden conversion experience as they compensate for their insecure attachment relationship by seeking a relationship with God. 
Researchers have tested these hypotheses using longitudinal studies and individuals' self narratives of their conversion experience. For example, one study investigating attachment styles and adolescent conversions at Young Life religious summer camps resulted in evidence supporting the correspondence hypothesis through analysis of personal narratives and a prospective longitudinal follow-up of Young Life campers, with mixed results for the compensation hypothesis.<ref>{{Cite journal

== Evolutionary and cognitive psychology of religion ==
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Neuroscience of religion}}
<!-- {{More footnotes|date=January 2012}} There's a main article linked which has more references that this section. Does that count, or should there be more references within the section itself?-->
[[Evolutionary psychology]] is based on the hypothesis that, just like the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, [[cognition]] has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through [[natural selection]]. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.

[[Pascal Boyer]] is one of the leading figures in the cognitive psychology of religion, a new field of inquiry that is less than fifteen years old, which accounts for the psychological processes that underlie religious thought and practice. In his book ''Religion Explained'', Boyer shows that there is no simple explanation for religious [[consciousness]]. Boyer is mainly concerned with explaining the various psychological processes involved in the acquisition and transmission of ideas concerning the gods. Boyer builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Scott Atran]], who first argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology, and purposeful violations of innate expectations about how the world is constructed (for example, bodiless beings with thoughts and emotions) that make religious cognitions striking and memorable.

Religious persons acquire religious ideas and practices through social exposure. The child of a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] will not become an evangelical [[Christians|Christian]] or a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a [[Roman Catholic]] but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says [[cognitive science]] can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations and in so doing enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.

Boyer moves outside the leading currents in mainstream [[cognitive psychology]] and suggests that we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's [[theory of evolution]]. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those [[reproductive]] ends.

For [[Steven Pinker]] the universal propensity toward religious belief is a genuine scientific puzzle. He thinks that [[adaptationist]] explanations for religion do not meet the criteria for adaptations. An alternative explanation is that religious psychology is a by-product of many parts of the mind that originally evolved for other purposes.

== Religion and prayer ==
Religious practice oftentimes manifests itself in some form of [[prayer]]. Recent studies have focused specifically on the effects of prayer on health. Measures of prayer and the above measures of spirituality evaluate different characteristics and should not be considered synonymous.

[[Prayer]] is fairly prevalent in the United States. About 75% of Americans report praying at least once a week.<ref>{{cite journal

This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).

Dein and Littlewood (2008) suggest that an individual's prayer life can be viewed on a spectrum ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale is characterized by a change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective has been shown to be associated with an individual's passage through adolescence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dein Simon, Littlewood Roland | year = 2008 | title = The Psychology of Prayer and the Development of the Prayer Experience Questionnaire | journal = Mental Health, Religion & Culture | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 39–52 | doi=10.1080/13674670701384396| s2cid = 143824787 }}</ref>

The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland.

Some studies have examined whether there is a "religious personality." Research suggests that people who identify as religious are more likely to be high on agreeableness and conscientiousness, and low on psychoticism, but unrelated to other Big Five traits.

===Religion and prejudice===
To investigate the salience of religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some studies have shown that greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups.<ref>{{Cite journal

Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification.

== Religion and drugs ==
{{Main|Religion and drugs}}
The American psychologist [[James H. Leuba]] (1868–1946), in ''A Psychological Study of Religion'', accounts for mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he considered to be necessary if religious psychology were to be looked at scientifically. Shamans all over the world and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion. The psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as those experienced in [[meditation]],<ref name="Robin L 2018">{{Cite journal|last1=Millière|first1=Raphaël|last2=Carhart-Harris|first2=Robin L.|last3=Roseman|first3=Leor|last4=Trautwein|first4=Fynn-Mathis|last5=Berkovich-Ohana|first5=Aviva|date=2018-09-04|title=Psychedelics, Meditation, and Self-Consciousness|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=9|page=1475|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01475|issn=1664-1078|pmc=6137697|pmid=30245648}}</ref> and [[mystical experience]]s.<ref name="Robin L 2018"/> [[Ego dissolution]] is often described as a key feature of the psychedelic experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Letheby|first1=Chris|last2=Gerrans|first2=Philip|date=2017-06-30|title=Self unbound: ego dissolution in psychedelic experience|journal=Neuroscience of Consciousness|volume=2017|issue=1|pages=nix016|doi=10.1093/nc/nix016|issn=2057-2107|pmc=6007152|pmid=30042848}}</ref>

[[William James]] was also interested in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with [[nitrous oxide]] and even peyote. He concludes that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others they are certainly ideas to be considered, but hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such.

== Religion and mental illness ==
{{See also|Religion and schizophrenia|Mental health of Jesus}}

Although many researchers have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious beliefs, practices, and experiences may be linked to [[mental illness]]es of various kinds<ref name="JNCN">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]] |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=October 2012 |pages=410–426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |issn=1545-7222 |oclc=823065628 |pmid=23224447|s2cid=207654711 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/14d7b462fa0d4041fb1e2685b62f9c60c09a5078 }}</ref> ([[mood disorders]], [[personality disorders]], and [[psychiatric disorders]]).<ref name="JNCN" /> In 2012 a team of [[psychiatrists]], [[Behaviorism|behavioral psychologists]], [[neurologists]], and [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrists]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]] published research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to [[religious delusion]] and [[hyperreligiosity]].<ref name="JNCN" />

They compared the thoughts and behaviors of the most important figures in the [[Bible]] ([[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus Christ]], and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]])<ref name="JNCN" /> with patients affected by mental disorders related to the [[Spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychotic spectrum]] using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria ([[DSM-IV-TR]]),<ref name="JNCN" /> and concluded that these Biblical figures "may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations",<ref name="JNCN" /> such as [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], [[delusional disorder]], [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]]-[[visual hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], [[Geschwind syndrome]] (Paul especially), and abnormal experiences associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).<ref name="JNCN" /> The authors suggest that Jesus sought to condemn himself to death ("[[Suicide methods#Indirect suicide|suicide by proxy]]").<ref name="JNCN" />

The research went further and also focused on [[Social psychology|social models]] of [[psychopathology]],<ref name="JNCN" /> analyzing [[new religious movements]] and charismatic [[Cult|cult leaders]] such as [[David Koresh]], leader of the [[Branch Davidians]],<ref name="JNCN" /> and [[Marshall Applewhite]], founder of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]].<ref name="JNCN" /> The researchers concluded that "If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum."<ref name="JNCN" />

In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst [[Robin S. Brown]] argues for the extent to which our spiritual commitments remain unconscious. Drawing from the work of Jung, Brown suggests that "our biases can only be suspended in the extent to which they are no longer our biases".<ref>Brown, R.S. (2017).

===Pastoral psychology===
One application of the psychology of religion is in pastoral psychology, the use of psychological findings to improve the [[pastoral care]] provided by [[pastor]]s and other [[clergy]], especially in how they support ordinary members of their [[local church|congregation]]s. Pastoral psychology is also concerned with improving the practice of [[chaplain]]s in [[healthcare]] and in the [[military]]. One major concern of pastoral psychology is to improve the practice of [[pastoral counseling]]. Pastoral psychology is a topic of interest for professional journals such as ''[[Pastoral Psychology (journal)|Pastoral Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Christianity]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Theology]]''. In 1984, [[Thomas C. Oden|Thomas Oden]] severely criticized mid-20th-century [[pastoral care]] and the pastoral psychology that guided it as having entirely abandoned its classical/traditional sources, and having become overwhelmingly dominated by modern psychological influences from [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]], and others.<ref name=oden84>{{cite book

In Tables 1 through 3, he demonstrated that in pastoral care textbooks, citations to psychologists (such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], and [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]]) had entirely replaced citations to traditional pastoral care thinkers (such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Gregory the Great]], and [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]]) between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century.</ref> More recently, others have described pastoral psychology as a field that experiences a tension between psychology and [[theology]].<ref>{{cite journal
