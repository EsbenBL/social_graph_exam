Feeling slighted by the lack of attention and resources given to his work, Kornhauser left the U of C in 1943.{{sfn|Zickar|2003|p=364}} After a brief research position at [[Columbia University]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Organizational Psychology: A Scientist-Practitioner Approach|author=Steve M.

Kornhauser's research covered a broad range of topics. He worked to develop the opinion polling techniques of [[David Houser]] into rigorous scientific techniques.{{sfn|Zickar|2003|p=365}}  He pioneered the union-friendly application of industrial psychology, which up to then had been entirely used in the service of management.{{sfn|Zickar|2003|p=365}}  Later in his career, he focused on workers' mental health.{{sfn|Zickar|2003|p=366}}  His 1965 work ''Mental Health of the Industrial Worker'' put forth the [[spillover hypothesis]], which traces the cause of problems in home and leisure life to problems at work.{{sfn|Zickar|2003|p=366}}  [[Ross Stagner]], who chaired the Wayne State psychology department at the time, stated that his own administrative support for Kornhauser's writing of the book was "one of my significant contributions to the field."{{sfn|Zickar|2003|p=366}}

Kornhauser retired from Wayne State in 1962. He died on December 11, 1990, of a stroke resulting from [[Parkinson's disease]], at his home in a retirement community in [[Santa Barbara, California]].<ref name="nyt"/>{{sfn|Zickar|2003|p=364}}
