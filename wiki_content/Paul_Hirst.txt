'''Paul Quentin Hirst'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|ɜr|s|t}}.}} (1946–2003) was a British sociologist and political theorist. He became Professor of Social Theory at [[Birkbeck College, London]], in 1985 and held the post until his death from a stroke and brain haemorrhage.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/20/guardianobituaries.highereducation|title=Obituary: Professor Paul Hirst|first=Ben|last=Pimlott|date=20 June 2003|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

==Biography==
On 20 May 1946, Hirst was born in [[Holbeton]], [[Devon]]. His father was in the armed forces and part of this childhood was spent in Germany. He went to grammar school in Plymouth, he studied social science at the University of Leicester, where he was taught by [[Sami Zubaida]], and took his master's in sociology at the [[University of Sussex]].<ref name=times>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/professor-paul-hirst-9kcbdrps0js|title=Professor Paul Hirst|date=23 June 2003|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref>

Hirst took up a lectureship at [[Birkbeck College]] in 1969. In 1972, he was one of the founding members of the Department of Politics and Sociology at Birkbeck. He was appointed Reader in Social Theory in 1978 and Professor seven years later.{{r|"Guardian"|times}}

During the 1970s he became well known (along with [[Barry Hindess]]) as the main figure in British [[structural Marxism]]. By the late 1970s and 1980s, however, Hirst had become a critic of [[Louis Althusser]]'s brand of [[Marxism]]. Drawing upon [[Michel Foucault]] but also [[W.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;O. Quine]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], he criticised essentialism, epistemological discourses and the possibility of any general theory, in a move against careless sociological constructionist imperialism. In his work on [[democratic governance]], he turned towards the ideas of the English political pluralists: [[John Neville Figgis]], [[G.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;H. Cole]], and [[Harold Laski]]. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hirst developed a theory of [[associationalism]] which attempted to revive [[social democracy]] by providing an alternative to [[state socialism]] and [[Neoliberalism|free-market liberalism]]. He also made important contributions to [[critical legal theory]].

His later work, with [[Grahame Thompson]] resulted in an influential criticism of fashionable theories of economic [[globalisation]], demonstrating the continued importance of the nation-state.{{r|times}} His book 'War and Power' is a historical-sociological analysis of the development of the modern state and state system and addresses some of current political challenges including climate change. His last book 'Space and Power' clearly demonstrated his intellectual scope. In the book he investigates the relationship between space and power, arguing that the exercise of power is both constrained by and shapes the character of the built environment.

With [[Mark Cousins (writer)|Mark Cousins]], [[Colin MacCabe]], and [[Richard Humphreys (writer)|Richard Humphreys]], he founded the [[London Consortium]] in 1993.{{r|times}} He chaired the Executive Committee of Charter 88 and was an early and regular contributor to ''[[openDemocracy]]''.

He died on 17 June 2003 in [[London]].
