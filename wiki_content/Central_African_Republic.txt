The '''Central African Republic''' ('''CAR'''; {{lang-sg|Ködörösêse tî Bêafrîka}};<span style="margin-left:1px">{{Needs IPA}}</span> {{lang-fr|République centrafricaine}}, '''RCA''';<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/central_african_republic.htm|title=Central African Republic – CAR – Country Profile – Nations Online Project|website=www.nationsonline.org}}</ref> {{IPA-fr|ʁepyblik sɑ̃tʁafʁikɛn|lang}}, or '''{{lang|fr|Centrafrique}}''', {{IPA-fr|sɑ̃tʁafʁik|}}) is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Chad]] to [[Central African Republic–Chad border|the north]], [[Sudan]] to [[Central African Republic–Sudan border|the northeast]], [[South Sudan]] to [[Central African Republic–South Sudan border|the southeast]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]] to [[Central African Republic–Democratic Republic of the Congo border|the south]], the [[Republic of the Congo]] to [[Central African Republic–Republic of the Congo border|the southwest]], and [[Cameroon]] to [[Cameroon–Central African Republic border|the west]]. 

The CAR covers a land area of about {{convert|620000|km2|sqmi}}. {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}}}, it had an estimated population of around {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Central African Republic}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}} million. {{As of|2021}}, the CAR is the scene of a [[Central African Republic Civil War|civil war, ongoing since 2012]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/central-african-republic|title=World Report 2019: Rights Trends in Central African Republic|last1=Mudge|first1=Lewis|date=11 December 2018|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>
Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean [[savanna]]s, but the country also includes a [[Sahel]]o-[[East Sudanian savanna|Sudanian]] zone in the north and an [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic|equatorial forest zone]] in the south. Two-thirds of the country is within the [[Ubangi River]] basin (which flows into the [[Congo River|Congo]]), while the remaining third lies in the basin of the [[Chari River|Chari]], which flows into [[Lake Chad]].

What is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited for millennia; however, the country's current borders were established by [[France]], which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century. After gaining independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders, including an [[Central African Empire|abortive attempt at a monarchy]].<ref name=Bokassa>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/jean-bedel-bokassa-posthumous-pardon 'Cannibal' dictator Bokassa given posthumous pardon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301025416/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/jean-bedel-bokassa-posthumous-pardon |date=1 March 2017 }}.

By the 1990s, calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993. [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] became president, but was later removed by [[François Bozizé|General François Bozizé]] in the [[2003 Central African Republic coup d'état|2003 coup]]. The [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began in 2004 and, despite a peace treaty in 2007 and another in 2011, civil war resumed in 2012. The civil war perpetuated the country's poor [[Human rights in the Central African Republic|human rights record]]: it was characterized by widespread and increasing abuses by various participating armed groups, such as arbitrary imprisonment, torture, and restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of movement.

The Central African Republic is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Economic Community of Central African States]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

== Etymology ==
The name of the Central African Republic is derived from the country's geographical location in the central region of Africa and its republic form of government. From 1976 to 1979, the country was known as the Central African Empire. During the colonial era, the country's name was Ubangi-Shari which is derived from the [[Ubangi River]] and the [[Chari River]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

France seized and colonized [[Ubangi-Shari]] territory in 1894. In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> portion of the Sangha and Lobaye basins to the [[German Empire]] which ceded a smaller area (in present-day [[Chad]]) to France. After [[World War I]] France again annexed the territory. Modeled on [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]]'s [[Congo Free State]], concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored to strip the region's assets as quickly and cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the French treasury. The concessionary companies [[corvée|forced local people]] to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas. Between 1890, a year after the French first arrived, and 1940, the population declined by half due to diseases, famine and exploitation by private companies.<ref name=fp1015>{{cite magazine|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/28/one-day-we-will-start-a-big-war-central-african-republic-un-violence/|title=One day we will start a big war|magazine=Foreign Policy|access-date=13 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205203123/http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/28/one-day-we-will-start-a-big-war-central-african-republic-un-violence/|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

After Boganda's death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, his cousin, [[David Dacko]], took control of MESAN.

On 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for Life in 1972 and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[Central African Empire]] (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa crowned himself in a lavish and expensive ceremony that was ridiculed by much of the world.<ref name=Bokassa/>

In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm 'Good old days' under Bokassa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043924/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm |date=3 December 2013 }}".

==== Central African Republic under Kolingba ====
Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC), was voluntary. In 1987 and 1988, semi-free elections to parliament were held, but Kolingba's two major political opponents, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], were not allowed to participate.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|title=Central African Republic – Discover World|website=www.discoverworld.com|access-date=10 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180433/https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the US, Germany, Japan, the EU, the [[World Bank]], and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a "Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a "Mixed Electoral Commission", which included representatives from all political parties.<ref name=":0" />

When a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR, Ange-Félix Patassé won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé's party required coalition partners.<ref name=":0" />

==== Patassé Government (1993–2003) ====
Patassé purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patassé's government of conducting a "witch hunt" against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996) the Peace Corps evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon.  To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic.  The [[Bangui Agreements]], signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|peacekeeping force (MINURCA)]]. Since 1997, the country has hosted almost a dozen peacekeeping interventions, earning it the title of "world champion of peacekeeping".<ref name=fp1015/>

In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats. The next year, however, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patassé won a second term in the presidential election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisa.org.za/wep/car1999results.htm|title=EISA Central African Republic: 1999 Presidential election results|date=October 2010|website=www.eisa.org.za|publisher=African Democracy Encyclopaedia Project|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]]. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] and Libyan soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|author=International Crisis Group|title=Central African Republic: Anatomy of a Phantom State|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|website=CrisisGroup.org|publisher=International Crisis Group|access-date=24 July 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626162538/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2014}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|failed coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of [[Bangui]] and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents. Eventually, Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Bozizé to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|title=Central African Republic History|date=2018|website=DiscoverWorld.com|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180433/https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Central African Republic is a landlocked nation within the interior of the African continent. It is bordered by Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of the Congo. The country lies between latitudes [[2nd parallel north|2°]] and [[11th parallel north|11°N]], and longitudes [[14th meridian east|14°]] and [[28th meridian east|28°E]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/africa/centralafricanrepublic/cfland.htm|title=Geography of Central African Republic, Landforms – World Atlas|last=Moen|first=John|website=www.worldatlas.com|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

Much of the country consists of flat or rolling plateau [[savanna]] approximately {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]]. In addition to the Fertit Hills in the northeast of the CAR, there are scattered hills in the southwest regions.

=== Land ===
The Central African Republic is roughly the size of [[France]] and is bordered by [[Chad]] to the north, [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] to the north and east, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) to the south, and [[Cameroon]] to the west. The capital, Bangui, is situated on the southern boundary, formed by the [[Ubangi River]], a tributary of the [[Congo River]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

=== Relief, drainage and soils ===
The Central African Republic occupies an immense rolling [[plateau]] that forms, along a crest that trends southwest to northeast, the major drainage divide between the [[Lake Chad]] and Congo River basins. The country is well supplied with waterways. Tributaries of the [[Chari River]] occupy the northern third of the country’s territory. The remaining two-thirds of the terrain drains southward into the [[Ubangi River]], which forms the Central African Republic’s southern border with Congo (Kinshasa).{{cn|date=August 2021}}

The vast central plains rise gradually in the northeast to the Bongos (Bongo) Massif, extending to an elevation of 4,360 feet (1,330 metres) at [[Mount Toussoro]], and to the [[Tondou Massif]] in the east.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} In the west they rise toward the high granite range of the [[Karre Mountains]], reaching nearly 4,625 feet (1,410 metres) at [[Mount Ngaoui]], the country’s highest point, before declining eastward into sandstone plateaus. In the north the most significant mountains are those of the [[Dar Challa]] range, which rise to 4,350 feet (1,326 metres) at [[Mount Ngaya]] near the border with Sudan. In the southeast is a plain cut by a number of [[River|rivers]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

===Wildlife===
{{main|Wildlife of the Central African Republic}}

In the southwest, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park is located in a rain forest area. The country is noted for its population of [[forest elephant]]s and [[western lowland gorilla]]s. In the north, the [[Manovo-Gounda St Floris National Park]] is well-populated with wildlife, including [[African leopard|leopards]], [[Central African lion|lions]], [[Sudan cheetah|cheetahs]] and [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]], and the [[Bamingui-Bangoran National Park]] is located in the northeast of CAR.

{{Prefectures of the Central African Republic Image Map|thumb|Prefectures of the Central African Republic}}
The Central African Republic is divided into 16 administrative [[prefecture]]s (''préfectures''), two of which are economic prefectures (''préfectures economiques''), and one an autonomous [[Commune (subnational entity)|commune]]; the prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures (''sous-préfectures'').<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Africa :: Central African Republic – The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/central-african-republic/|access-date=5 June 2020|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=30 June 2015|title=Central African Republic Prefectures|url=http://www.statoids.com/ucf.html|access-date=5 June 2020|website=www.statoids.com}}</ref>

Politics in the Central African Republic formally take place in a framework of a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]]. In this system, the [[Heads of state of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|President]] is the [[head of state]], with a [[Heads of government of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament.<ref name="CIA" />

Changes in government have occurred in recent years by three methods: violence, negotiations, and elections. A new constitution was approved by voters in a referendum held on 5 December 2004. The government was rated 'Partly Free' from 1991 to 2001 and from 2004 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=FIW Score|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls|work=Freedom House|access-date=26 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424223549/http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls|archive-date=24 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Executive branch ===
The president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term, and the prime minister is appointed by the president. The president also appoints and presides over the [[Central African Republic Council of Ministers|Council of Ministers]], which initiates laws and oversees government operations. However, as of 2018 the official government is not in control of large parts of the country, which are governed by rebel groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/rebels-in-the-central-african-republic-are-filling-the-void-of-an-absent-government/2018/03/25/3e11d960-2328-11e8-946c-9420060cb7bd_story.html|title=Rebels in the Central African Republic are filling the void of an absent government|last=Losh|first=Jack|date=26 March 2018|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

{{main|Economy of the Central African Republic}}

The [[per capita income]] of the Republic is often listed as being approximately $400 a year, [[List of countries by GNI (PPP) per capita|one of the lowest in the world]], but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the unregistered sale of foods, locally produced [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[diamond]]s, [[ivory]], [[bushmeat]], and [[traditional medicine]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|date=19 June 2019|title=Central African Republic – Systematic Country Diagnostic : Priorities for Ending Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/459721563221464687/Central-African-Republic-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic-Priorities-for-Ending-Poverty-and-Boosting-Shared-Prosperity|journal=[[The World Bank]]|language=en|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=1–96|via=documents.worldbank.org/}}</ref>

The currency of the Central African Republic is the [[Central African CFA franc|CFA franc]], which is accepted across the former countries of French West Africa and trades at a fixed rate to the euro. Diamonds constitute the country's most important export, accounting for 40–55% of export revenues, but it is estimated that between 30% and 50% of those produced each year leave the country clandestinely.<ref name=":2" />

Agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[sesame]], and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. The annual real GDP [[Economic growth|growth rate]] is just above 3%. The importance of food crops over exported [[cash crops]] is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 [[tonnes]] a year, while the production of [[cotton]], the principal exported cash crop, ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year.
