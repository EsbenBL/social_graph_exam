'''Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey''' (7 August 1903 – 1 October 1972) was a Kenyan-British [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] and [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] whose work was important in demonstrating that humans evolved in Africa, particularly through discoveries made at [[Olduvai Gorge]] with his wife, fellow [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[Mary Leakey]]. Having established a program of [[Paleoanthropology|palaeoanthropological]] inquiry in eastern Africa, he also motivated many future generations to continue this scholarly work. Several members of the [[Leakey family]] became prominent scholars themselves.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Another of Leakey's legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats, which he saw as key to understanding [[human evolution]]. He personally focused on three female researchers, [[Jane Goodall]], [[Dian Fossey]], and [[Birutė Galdikas]], calling them [[The Trimates]].<ref name="The Vanishing Man of the Forest">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/06/opinion/06galdikas.html?ex=1168750800&en=eb87fc08333eabee&ei=5070&emc=eta1 |title=The Vanishing Man of the Forest |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 January 2007 |publisher=Galdikas, Birute Mary, [[The New York Times]], 6 January 2007 |access-date=2013-12-08|last1=Galdikas |first1=Birute Mary }}</ref><ref>Morell, Virginia, "Called "'Trimates,' Three Bold Women Shaped Their Field".

Leakey also encouraged and supported many other PhD. candidates, most notably from the [[University of Cambridge]]. Leakey also played a role in creating organizations for future research in Africa and for protecting wildlife there.

==Background==
{{See also|Leakey family}}
{{quote|When I think back... of the [[serval]] cat and a [[baboon]] that I had as pets in my childhood days—and that eventually I had to house in large cages—it makes me sad. It makes me sadder still, however, and also very angry, when I think of the innumerable adult animals and birds deliberately caught and locked up for the so-called 'pleasure' and 'education' of thoughtless human beings.|author=Louis Leakey|source=''By the Evidence'', Chapter 4}}

Louis's parents, Harry (1868–1940) and Mary (May) Bazett Leakey (died 1948), were [[Church of England]] missionaries in [[British East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]). Harry was the son of James Shirley Leakey (1824–1871), one of the eleven children of the portrait painter [[James Leakey]]. Harry Leakey was assigned to an established post of the [[Church Mission Society]] among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] at [[Kabete]], in the highlands north of [[Nairobi]]. The station was at that time a hut and two tents. Louis's earliest home had an earthen floor, a leaky [[thatching|thatched roof]], rodents and insects, and no heating system except for charcoal [[brazier]]s. The facilities slowly improved over time. The mission, a center of activity, set up a clinic in one of the tents, and later a [[Female education#Africa|girls' school]]. Harry was working on a [[translation of the Bible]] into the [[Gikuyu language]]. He had a distinguished career in the CMS, becoming [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the station.<ref>Louis reports in his ''Memoirs'', Chapter 6</ref>

Louis had a younger brother, Douglas, and two older sisters, Gladys and Julia. Both sisters married missionaries: Gladys married [[Leonard Beecher]], Anglican [[Bishop of Mombasa]] and then [[Anglican Church of Kenya|Archbishop of East Africa]] from 1960 to 1970; Julia married [[Lawrence Barham]], the second [[Province of the Anglican Church of Burundi|Bishop of Rwanda and Burundi]] from 1964 to 1966; their son [[Ken Barham]] was later the Bishop of [[Cyangugu]] in Rwanda.

The Leakey household came to contain Miss Oakes (a [[governess]]), Miss Higgenbotham (another missionary), and Mariamu (a Kikuyu nurse). Louis grew up, played, and learned to hunt with the native Kikuyus. He also learned to walk with the distinctive gait of the Kikuyu and speak their language fluently, as did his siblings. He was initiated into the Kikuyu ethnic group, an event of which he never spoke, as he was sworn to secrecy.<ref>According to Blake Edgar in [http://www.leakeyfoundation.org/newsandevents/n3.jsp Louis Leakey's Legacy: Celebrating the Centennial of His Extraordinary Life and Finds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207125829/http://www.leakeyfoundation.org/newsandevents/n3.jsp |date=7 February 2007 }} in AnthroQuest Online for Fall, 2003, Louis received the Kikuyu name Wakuruigi, "Son of the Sparrow Hawk." Harry also had a name, apparently not an initiation name, but rather descriptive: Giteru, "Big beard".</ref>

Louis requested and was given permission to build and move into a hut, [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] style, at the end of the garden. It was home to his personal collection of natural objects, such as birds' eggs and skulls. All the children developed a keen interest in and appreciation of the pristine natural surroundings in which they found themselves. They raised baby animals, later turning them over to zoos. Louis read a [[gift book]], ''Days Before History'', by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] (1907), a juvenile fictional work illustrating the [[prehistory of Britain]]. He began to collect tools and was further encouraged in this activity by a role model, [[Arthur Loveridge]], first curator (1914) of the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, predecessor of the [[National Museums of Kenya|Coryndon Museum]]. This interest may have predisposed him toward a career in archaeology. His father was also a role model: Canon Leakey co-founded the East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society.<ref>Canon Leakey also was a naturalist and must have been a significant model, as Louis wished originally to pattern his life after his father's, according to Louis' ''Memoirs'', Chapter 8.</ref>

Neither Harry nor May were of strong constitution. From 1904 to 1906 the entire family lived at May's mother's house in [[Reading, Berkshire]], England, while Harry recovered from [[neurasthenia]], and again in 1911–1913, while May recovered from general frailty and exhaustion. During the latter stay, Harry bought a house in [[Boscombe]], [[Hampshire]].<ref>The facts for this section were gathered mainly from ''Ancestral Passions'', Chapter 1, "Kabete", and from the "Publisher's Prologue" of the Harcourt Brace Jovanovich edition of ''By the Evidence''.</ref>

==Formative years==
=== Attendance at Cambridge ===
In Britain, the Leakey children attended elementary school; in Africa, they had a tutor. The family sat out [[World War I]] in Africa. When the sea lanes opened again in 1919, they returned to Boscombe, where Louis was sent to [[Weymouth College (Public School)|Weymouth College]], a private boys' school, when he was 16 years old. In three years there, he did not do well and complained of hazing and rules that he considered an infringement on his freedom. Advised by one teacher to seek employment in a bank, he secured help from an English teacher in applying to [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He received a scholarship for his high scores on the entrance exams.

Louis matriculated at the [[University of Cambridge]], his father's alma mater, in 1922, intending to become a missionary to British East Africa.

He frequently told a story about his final exams. When he had arrived in Britain, he had notified the register that he was fluent in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. When he came to his finals, he asked to be examined in this language, and the authorities agreed. Then one day, he received two letters. One instructed him to report at a certain time and place for a ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'' examination in Swahili. The other asked if, at the same time and place, he would examine a candidate in Swahili.

===Archaeological and paleontological research===
In 1922, the British had been awarded [[German East Africa]] as part of the settlement of World War I. Within the [[Tanganyika Territory]] the Germans had discovered a site rich in [[dinosaur]] fossils, [[Tendaguru]]. Louis was told by [[Charles William Hobley|C. W. Hobley]], a friend of the family, that the [[British Museum of Natural History]] was going to send a fossil-hunting expedition led by William E. Cutler to the site. Louis applied and was hired to locate the site and manage the administrative details.<ref>''New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs: The Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium'' editors Michael J. Ryan, Brenda J. Chinnery-Allgeier, David A. Eberth. Indiana University Press 2010. Chapter 35 "Lost in plain sight: Rediscovery of William E. Cutler's lost Eoceratops" by [[Darren Tanke]] of the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]]</ref> In 1924 they departed for Africa. They never found a complete dinosaur skeleton, and Louis was recalled from the site by Cambridge in 1925.

Louis switched his focus to anthropology, and found a new mentor in [[Alfred Cort Haddon]], head of the Cambridge department. In 1926, Louis graduated with a "[[double first]]", or high honours, in anthropology and archaeology. He had used some of his preexisting qualifications; for example, Kikuyu was offered and accepted as the second [[modern language]] in which he was required to be proficient, even though no one there could test him on it. The university accepted an affidavit from a Kikuyu chief signed with a thumbprint.

From 1925 on Louis lectured and wrote on African archaeological and palaeontological topics. On graduation he was such a respected figure that Cambridge sent him to East Africa to study prehistoric African humans. He excavated dozens of sites, undertaking for the first time a systematic study of the artifacts. Some of his names for archaeological cultures are still in use; for example, the [[Elmenteitan]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robertshaw|first1=Peter|title=The elmenteitan: An early food‐producing culture in East Africa|journal=World Archaeology|date=1988|volume=20|issue=1|pages=57–69|doi=10.1080/00438243.1988.9980056}}</ref>

===Research Fellow===
[[File:StJohnsCambNewCourt.jpg|thumb|left|St. John's College, Cambridge.]]
In 1927, Louis received a visit at a site called Gamble's Cave, near [[Lake Elmenteita]], by two women on a holiday, one of whom was Frida Avern (1902–1993). Avern had done some course work in archaeology. Louis and Frida began a relationship, which continued upon his return to Cambridge. In 1928, they married and continued work near Lake Elmenteita. Finds from Gamble's Cave were donated by Leakey to the [[British Museum]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=52437&plaA=52437-3-1|title=Collection search: You searched for|access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref> At that time he discovered the [[Acheulean]] site of [[Kariandusi Prehistoric Site|Kariandusi]], which he excavated in 1928.

On the strength of his work there, he obtained a post-graduate research fellowship at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]] and returned to Cambridge in 1929 to classify and prepare the finds from Elmenteita. His patron and mentor at Cambridge were now [[Arthur Keith]]. While cleaning two skeletons he had found, he noticed a similarity to one found in [[Olduvai Gorge]] by Professor [[Hans Reck]], a German national, whom Louis had met in 1925 in Germany while on business for Keith.
[[File:Olduvai-Schlucht Mike Krüger 110126 1.jpg|thumb|right|Olduvai Gorge 2011.]]
The geology of Olduvai was known. In 1913, Reck had extricated a skeleton from Bed II in the gorge wall. He argued that it must have the date of the bed, which was believed to be 600,000 years, in the mid-[[Pleistocene]]. Early dates for human evolution were not widely accepted by the general public at the time. Reck became involved in a media uproar. He was barred from going back to settle the question by the war and then the terms of the transfer of Tanganyika from Germany to Britain.<ref>For an account of the incident refer to ''[http://www.calarts.edu/~shockley/oh1.html Hans Reck and the Discovery of O.H.1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203012539/http://www.calarts.edu/~shockley/oh1.html |date=3 February 2007 }}'' at the "Always Something New" site.</ref> In 1929, Louis visited Berlin to talk to the now skeptical Reck. Noting an [[Acheulean]] tool in Reck's collection of artifacts from Olduvai, he bet Reck he could find ancient stone tools at Olduvai within 24 hours.<ref>The source for this subsection is Morell, Chapter 3, "Laying Claim to the Earliest Man".</ref>

Louis received his PhD in 1930 at the age of 27. His first child, a daughter named Priscilla Muthoni Leakey, was born in 1931. His headaches and epilepsy returned, and he was prescribed [[Phenobarbital|Luminal]], which he took for the rest of his life.

==Reversals of fortune==
=== Defense of Reck ===
In November 1931, Louis led an expedition to Olduvai whose members included Reck,<ref>Arthur Tindell Hopwood, Donald MacInnes, [[Vivian Fuchs]], Captain Hewlitt, Frances Kenrick, Frida, Reck, and a number of African assistants.</ref> whom Louis allowed to enter the gorge first. Leakey had bet Reck that Leakey would find Acheulean tools within the first 24 hours, which he did.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton |first1=Glenn R. |title=Adam, Apes and Anthropology |date=1997 |publisher=Lulu.com (self-published) |location=Spring, Texas |isbn=0-9648227-2-5 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80hHDwAAQBAJ}}{{self-published source|date=May 2020}}</ref> These verified the provenance of the 1913 find, now called Olduvai Man. Non-humanoid fossils and tools were extracted from the ground in large numbers. Frida delayed joining her husband and was less enthusiastic about him on behalf of Priscilla. She did arrive eventually, however, and Louis put her to work. Frida's site became FLK, for Frida Leakey's Karongo ("gully").<ref name=frida>{{Cite ODNB|title=Leakey, Henrietta Wilfrida (1902–1993)|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-52219|access-date=2020-09-23|year=2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/52219}}</ref>

Back in Cambridge, the skeptics were not impressed. To find supporting evidence of the antiquity of Reck's Olduvai Man, Louis returned to Africa, excavating at [[Kanam (Kenya)|Kanam]] and [[Kanjera]]. He easily found more fossils, which he named [[Homo kanamensis]]. While he was gone, the opposition worked up some "evidence" of the intrusion of Olduvai Man into an earlier layer, evidence that seemed convincing at the time, but is missing and unverifiable now. On his return, Louis' finds were carefully examined by a committee of 26 scientists and were tentatively accepted as valid.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}<ref>Read about these events in ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25470615?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Recent Research into Oldowan Hominin Activities at Kanjera South, Western Kenya]'', by L. C. Bishop et al., published in the ''African Archaeological Review''.</ref>

===Scandal===
With Frida's dowry money, the Leakeys bought a large brick house in [[Girton, Cambridgeshire|Girton]] near Cambridge, which they named "The Close."

Frida was now pregnant and suffered from [[morning sickness]] most of the time and was unable to work on the illustrations for Louis's second book, ''Adam's Ancestors.'' At a dinner party given in his honor after a lecture of his at the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]], [[Gertrude Caton-Thompson]] introduced her own illustrator, the twenty-year-old [[Mary Leakey|Mary Nicol]]. Louis convinced Mary to take on the illustration of his book, and a few months later companionship turned to an affair.<ref name=morell/> Frida gave birth to [[Colin Leakey|Colin]] in December 1933, and the next month Louis left her and his new born son.<ref name=frida/> She would not sue for divorce until 1936.<ref name=morell>This account is based on Morell, Chapter 4, "Louis and Mary".</ref>

A panel at Cambridge investigated his morals. Grants dried up, but his mother raised enough money for another expedition to Olduvai, Kanam and Kanjera, the latter two on the [[Winam Gulf]].<ref>The guest list is Peter Bell (zoologist), Sam White (surveyor), Peter Kent (geologist), Heselon Mukiri, Thairu Irumbi, Ndekei.</ref> His previous work there was questioned by [[Percy George Hamnall Boswell|P. G. H. Boswell]],<ref>Head of the Department of Geology at the [[Imperial College of Science]], London.</ref> whom he invited to verify the sites for himself. Arriving at Kanam and Kanjera in 1935, they found that the iron markers Louis had used to mark the sites had been removed by the [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]] tribe for use as harpoons and the sites could not now be located. To make matters worse, all the photos Louis took were ruined by a light leak in the camera. After an irritating and fruitless two-month search, Boswell left for England, promising, as Louis understood it, not to publish a word until Louis returned.

Boswell immediately set out to publish as many words as he was able, beginning with a letter in ''Nature'' dated 9 March 1935, destroying Reck's and Louis's dates of the fossils and questioning Louis's competence. Despite the searches for the iron markers, Boswell averred that "the earlier expedition (of 1931–32) neither marked the localities on the ground nor recorded the sites on a map."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Boswell | first =  P. G. H. | title = Human Remains from Kanam and Kanjera, Kenya Colony | journal = Nature | volume = 135 | issue = 3410 | pages = 371 | date = 1935-03-09 | language = en | doi = 10.1038/135371a0 | bibcode = 1935Natur.135..371B | s2cid = 4079483 }}</ref> In a field report of March 1935, Louis accused Boswell of reneging on his word, but Boswell asserted he had made no such promise, and now having public opinion on his side, warned Louis to withdraw the claim. Louis was not only forced to retract the accusation in his final field report in June 1935, but also to recant his support of Reck. Louis was through at Cambridge. Even his mentors turned on him.<ref>This account is based on Morell, Chapter 5, "Disaster at Kanam", supplemented with detail from Louis' account in ''By the Evidence'', Chapter 2. Olduvai Man languished through World War II in a Berlin museum and then partially disappeared, but preservative applied to the bones took away any hope of an accurate C-14 date; however, neither can any evidence of intrusion be located. Kanjera Man is ancient, possibly [[Homo habilis]]; Homo kanamensis is an intrusion.</ref>

===On the road in Africa===
Meeting Mary in Africa, he proceeded to Olduvai with a small party. Louis' parents continued to urge him to return to Frida, and would pay for everyone in the party but Mary. Mary joined him under a stigma but her skill and competence eventually won over the other participants. Louis and his associates did the groundwork for future excavation at Olduvai, uncovering dozens of sites for a broad sampling, as was his method. They were named after the excavator: SHK (Sam Howard's karongo), BK (Peter Bell's), SWK (Sam White's), MNK (Mary Nicol's). Louis and Mary conducted a temporary clinic for the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], made preliminary investigations of [[Laetoli]], and ended by studying the rock paintings at the [[Kisese]]/[[Cheke, Tanzania|Cheke]] region.<ref>The initial chapters of ''By the Evidence'' and Morell, Chapter 6, "Olduvai's Bounty", describe the explorations on which these few sentences are based.</ref>

===Return to England===
[[File:Steen Cottage, Nasty.jpg|thumb|Steen Cottage, Nasty, Great Munden in 2011]]
Louis and Mary returned to England in 1935 without positions or any place to stay except Mary's mother's apartment. They soon leased Steen Cottage in [[Great Munden]]. This settlement was in [[Hertfordshire]] and had an unusual name which Louis, with his sense of humor noted in his ''Memoirs'', Chapter 5, as "the village of [[Nasty, Hertfordshire|Nasty]]." They lived without heat, electricity, or plumbing, fetching water from a well and writing by oil lantern. They lived in poverty for 18 months at this low point of their fortunes, visited at first only by Mary's relatives. Louis gardened for subsistence and exercise and improved the house and grounds. He appealed at last to the [[Royal Society]], who relented with a small grant to continue work on his collection.

==In British East Africa==
=== Return to British East Africa ===
Louis had already involved himself in Kikuyu tribal affairs in 1928, taking a stand against [[female genital cutting]]. He got into a shouting match in Kikuyu one evening with [[Jomo Kenyatta]], later the [[president of Kenya]], who was lecturing on the topic. R. Copeland at Oxford recommended he apply to the [[Rhodes Trust]] for a grant to write a study of the Kikuyu and it was given late in 1936 along with a salary for two years. In January 1937 the Leakeys travelled to Kenya. Colin would not see his father for 20 years.

Louis returned to [[Kiambaa]] near [[Nairobi]] and persuaded Senior Chief Koinange, who designated a committee of chiefs, to help him describe the Kikuyu the way they had been. Mary excavated at Waterfall Cave.<ref>According to Louis's ''Memoirs'', Chapter 6, it was the chief who suggested she excavate. He knew artifacts were being washed from the cave. Louis and Mary had moved into a hut in his compound at his invitation.</ref> She fell ill with double pneumonia and was near death for two weeks in the hospital in Nairobi, during which time her mother was sent for. Contrary to expectation, she recovered and began another excavation at [[Hyrax Hill]] and then [[Njoro River Cave]]. Louis got an extension of his grant, which he used partially for fossil-hunting. Leakey discoveries began to appear in the newspapers again.

Tensions between the Kikuyu and the settlers increased alarmingly. Louis jumped into the fray as an exponent of the middle ground. In ''Kenya: Contrasts and Problems'', he angered the settlers by proclaiming Kenya could never be a "white man's country."

===Fossil police===
The government offered Louis work as a policeman in intelligence, which he accepted. He traveled the country as a pedlar, reporting on the talk. When Britain went to war in September 1939 the Kenyan government drafted Louis into its African intelligence service.<ref>Louis describes this authority in Chapter 8 of his ''Memoirs'' as "...the CID... Special Branch, Section 6, concerned with civil intelligence." The drafting authority was the "Kenya government" and there is no indication in the ''Memoirs'' that the service was more directly British; in fact, he refers to "my counterpart in military intelligence." However, Louis would not be revealing everything he knew. Morell portrays him as having been in police work before being drafted. She had personal access to the surviving Leakeys.</ref> Apart from some bumbling around, during which he and some settlers stalked each other as possible saboteurs of the [[Sagana]] [[Rail transport in Kenya|Railway Bridge]],<ref>''Memoirs'', Chapter 8.</ref> his first task was to supply and arm [[Gideon Force|Ethiopian guerrillas]] against the Italian [[East African Campaign (World War II)|invaders of their country]]. He created a clandestine network using his childhood friends among the Kikuyu. They also hunted fossils on the sly.

Louis conducted interrogations, analyzed handwriting, wrote radio broadcasts and took on regular police investigations. He loved a good mystery of any sort. The white leadership of the [[King's African Rifles]] used him extensively to clear up many cultural mysteries; for example, he helped an officer remove a curse he had inadvertently put on his men.<ref>''Memoirs'', Chapter 9.</ref>

Mary continued to find and excavate sites. Jonathan Leakey was born in 1940. She worked in the Coryndon Memorial Museum (later called the [[National Museums of Kenya]]) where Louis joined her as an unpaid honorary curator in 1941. Their life was a melange of police work and archaeology. They investigated [[Rusinga Island]] and [[Olorgesailie]]. At the latter site they were assisted by a team of Italian experts recruited from the prisoners of war and paroled for the purpose.<ref>''Memoirs'', Chapter 12.</ref>

In 1942, the Italian menace ended, but the Japanese began to reconnoiter with a view toward landing in force. Louis found himself in counter-intelligence work, which he performed with zest and imagination. Deborah was born, but died at three months. They lived in a rundown and bug infested Nairobi home, [[tied accommodation|provided by the museum]]. Jonathan was attacked by [[army ant]]s in his crib.<ref>This section is based on Morell, Chapter 8, "Cloak-and-Dagger".</ref>

===Turn of the tide===
In 1944 [[Richard Leakey]] was born. In 1945 the family's income from police work all but vanished. By now Louis was getting plenty of job offers but he chose to stay on in Kenya as Curator of the Coryndon Museum, with an annual salary and a house, but more importantly, to continue palaeoanthropological research.

In January 1947 Louis conducted the first Pan-African Congress of Prehistory at Nairobi. Sixty scientists from 26 countries attended, delivering papers and visiting the Leakey sites. The conference restored Louis to the scientific fold and made him a major figure in it. With the money that now poured in Louis undertook the famous expeditions of 1948 and beyond at [[Rusinga Island]] in [[Lake Victoria]], where Mary discovered the most complete [[Proconsul (mammal)|Proconsul]] fossil up to that time.

[[Charles Watson Boise]] donated money for a boat to be used for transport on Lake Victoria, ''The Miocene Lady''. Its skipper, Hassan Salimu, was later to deliver [[Jane Goodall]] to Gombe. [[Philip Leakey]] was born in 1949. In 1950, Louis was awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Oxford University]].

===Kenyan affairs===
{{quote|text=... I sought a personal interview with the governor, hoping to make him appreciate that it was no longer possible to continue along the lines of the old colonial regime. ... Colonial governors and senior civil servants are not easy people to argue with; and, of course, I was not popular, because of my criticism of the colonial service ... Had it been possible to make the government open its eyes to the realities of the situation, I believe that the whole miserable episode of what is frequently spoken of as '[[Mau Mau Uprising|the Mau Mau rebellion]]' need never have taken place.|Louis Leakey|''By the Evidence'', Chapter 18}}
While the Leakeys were at Lake Victoria, the Kikuyu struck at the European settlers of the Kenyan highlands, who seemed to have the upper hand and were insisting on a "white" government of a "white" Africa. In 1949 the Kikuyu formed a secret society, the [[Mau Mau]], which attacked settlers and especially loyalist Kikuyu.

Louis had attempted to warn [[Philip Euen Mitchell|Sir Philip Mitchell]], governor of the colony, that nocturnal meetings and forced oaths were not Kikuyu customs and foreboded violence, but was ignored. Now he found himself pulled away from anthropology to investigate the Mau Mau. During this period his life was threatened and a reward placed on his head. The Leakeys began to pack pistols, termed "European National Dress." The government placed him under 24-hour guard.

In 1952, after a Mau Mau massacre of pro-British chiefs, the government arrested [[Jomo Kenyatta]], president of the [[Kenya African Union]]. Louis was summoned to be a court interpreter, but withdrew after an accusation of mistranslation because of prejudice against the defendant. He returned on request to translate documents only. Because of lack of evidence linking Kenyatta to the Mau Mau, although convicted, he did not receive the death penalty, but was sentenced to several years of hard labor and banned from Kenya.

The government brought in British troops and formed a home guard of 20,000 Kikuyu. During this time Louis played a difficult and contradictory role. He sided with the settlers, serving as their spokesman and intelligence officer, helping to ferret out bands of guerrillas. On the other hand, he continued to advocate for the Kikuyu in his 1954 book ''Defeating Mau Mau'' and numerous talks and articles. He recommended a multi-racial government, land reform in the highlands, a wage hike for the Kikuyu, and many other reforms, most of which were eventually adopted.

The government then realized the rebellion was being directed from urban centers, instituted [[martial law]] and detained the committees. Following Louis' suggestion, thousands of Kikuyu were placed in re-education camps and resettled in new villages. The rebellion continued from bases under [[Mount Kenya]] until 1956, when, deprived of its leadership and supplies, it had to disperse. The state of emergency lasted until 1960. In 1963 Kenya became independent, with Jomo Kenyatta as prime minister.<ref>This subsection is based on Morell's chapter 11, "Louis and Kenyatta".</ref>

==Work in palaeoanthropology==
===Olduvai Gorge===
{{quote|text=We know from the study of evolution that, again and again, various branches of animal stock have become over-specialized, and that over-specialization has led to their extinction. Present-day ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is in many physical respects still very unspecialized ... But in one thing man, as we know him today, is over-specialized. His brain power is very over-specialized compared to the rest of his physical make-up, and it may well be that this over-specialization will lead, just as surely, to his extinction. ... if we are to control our future, we must first understand the past better.|Louis Leakey|''Adam's Ancestors'', 4th ed., final page}}
Beginning in 1951, Louis and Mary began intensive research at Olduvai Gorge. A trial trench in Bed II at BK in 1951 was followed by a more extensive excavation in 1952. They found what Louis termed an [[Oldowan]] "slaughter-house", an ancient bog where animals had been trapped and butchered. Excavations stopped in 1953 but were briefly resumed in 1955 with Jean Brown.<ref>Morell, Chapter 12, "Our Man".</ref>

In 1959, excavations at Bed I were opened. While Louis was sick in camp, Mary discovered the fossilized skull [[OH 5]] at FLK, ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'', famously identified as "''Zinjanthropus''" or "Zinj." The question was whether the fossil belonged to a previous genus discovered by [[Robert Broom]], ''[[Paranthropus]]'', or a member of a different genus ancestral to humans. Louis opted for ''Zinjanthropus'', a decision opposed by [[Wilfrid Le Gros Clark]], but one which attracted the attention of [[Melville Bell Grosvenor]], president of the [[National Geographic Society]]. That contact resulted in an article in ''National Geographic''<ref>September 1960, ''Finding the World's Earliest Man''.</ref> and a large grant to continue work at Olduvai.

In 1960, geophysicists [[Jack Evernden]] and [[Garniss Curtis]] dated Bed I from 1.89 to 1.75 million years ago, confirming the great antiquity of fossil hominids in Africa.<ref name="TaylorAitken1997">{{cite book|editor-last=Taylor|editor-first=R. E.|editor2-last=Aitken|editor2-first=M. J.|title=Chronometric Dating in Archaeology, Vol. 2|pages=110|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York|year=1997|isbn=978-0-306-45715-9}}</ref>

In 1960, Louis appointed Mary director of excavation at Olduvai. She brought in a staff of [[Kamba people|Kamba]] assistants, including [[Kamoya Kimeu]], who later discovered many of eastern Africa's most famous fossils. At Olduvai, Mary set up Camp 5 and began work with her own staff and associates.

At "Jonny's site", FLK-NN, Jonathan Leakey discovered two skull fragments without the [[Australopithecine]] [[sagittal crest]], which Mary connected with Broom's and Robinson's ''[[Telanthropus]]''. The problem with it was its contemporaneity with ''Zinjanthropus''. When mailed photographs, Le Gros Clark retorted casually "Shades of [[Piltdown man|Piltdown]]." Louis cabled him immediately and had some strong words at this suggestion of his incompetence. Clark apologized.<ref>Morell, Chapter 14, "Mary's Dig".</ref>

Not long afterwards, in 1960, Louis, his son Philip and Ray Pickering discovered a fossil he termed "Chellean Man", ([[Olduvai Hominid 9]]), in context with [[Oldowan]] tools. After reconstruction Louis and Mary called it "Pinhead." It was subsequently identified as ''Homo erectus'', contemporaneous with ''[[Paranthropus]]'' at 1.4 million years old.<ref>{{cite web|title=OH 9|url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/fossils/oh-9|website=Smithsonian Institution, Human Origins Initiative|date=7 February 2010|access-date=17 May 2016}}</ref>

In 1961 Louis got a salary as well as a grant from the [[National Geographic Society]] and turned over the acting directorship of Coryndon to a subordinate. He created the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the same grounds, moved his collections to it, and appointed himself director. This was his new operations center. He opened another excavation at [[Fort Ternan]] on Lake Victoria. Shortly after, Heselon discovered ''[[Kenyapithecus wickeri]]'', named after the owner of the property. Louis promptly celebrated with [[George Gaylord Simpson]], who happened to be present, aboard the ''Miocene Lady'' with "Leakey Safari Specials", a drink made of [[condensed milk]] and [[cognac]].

In 1962 Louis was visiting Olduvai when Ndibo Mbuika discovered the first tooth of ''[[Homo habilis]]'' at MNK. Louis and Mary thought it was female and named her Cinderella, or Cindy. [[Phillip Tobias]] identified Jonny's Child with it and [[Raymond Dart]] came up with the name ''Homo habilis'' at Louis' request, which Tobias translated as "handyman."<ref>Morell Chapter 16, "The Human with Ability." [[Richard Leakey]] tells a different story about the name. See the ''Notes'' section of ''[[Homo habilis]]''.</ref> It was seen as intermediary between gracile ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and ''Homo''.<ref>These few paragraphs rely on Morell, Chapter 16, "The Human with Ability".</ref>

===Calico Hills===
{{Main|Calico Early Man Site}}

In 1959 Leakey, while at the [[British Museum of Natural History]] in London, received a visit from [[Ruth DeEtte Simpson]], an archaeologist from California. Simpson had acquired what looked like ancient [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s from a site in the Calico Hills and showed it to Leakey.

In 1963, Leakey obtained funds from the [[National Geographic Society]] and commenced [[archaeological excavation]]s with Simpson. Excavations at the site carried out by Leakey and Simpson revealed that they had located stone [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] which were dated 100,000 years or older, suggesting a human presence in North America much earlier than others had estimated.<ref>Cameron B. Wesson, ''Historical Dictionary of Early North America'', 2005, p. 35.</ref>

The geologist [[Vance Haynes]] had made three visits to the site in 1973 and had claimed that the artifacts found by Leakey were naturally formed [[geofacts]]. According to Haynes, the geofacts were formed by stones becoming fractured in an ancient river on the site.<ref>Steven Mithen, ''After the Ice: a global human history, 20,000–5000 BC'', 2006, p. 540.</ref>

In her autobiography, [[Mary Leakey]] wrote that because of Louis's involvement with the Calico Hills site she had lost academic respect for him and that the Calico excavation project was "catastrophic to his professional career and was largely responsible for the parting of our ways".<ref>Mary Leakey, ''Disclosing the past'', 1984, pp. 142–144.</ref>

==The Trimates==
{{main|The Trimates}}
One of Louis's legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of [[primate]]s in their natural habitats, which he understood as key to unraveling the mysteries of [[human evolution]]. He personally chose three female researchers, [[Jane Goodall]], [[Dian Fossey]], and [[Birutė Galdikas]], calling them [[The Trimates]].<ref name="The Vanishing Man of the Forest"/><ref>Morell, Virginia, "Called 'Trimates,' Three Bold Women Shaped Their Field", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol. 260, 16 April 1993, pp. 420–425.</ref> Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology, immersing themselves in the study of [[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[orangutan]]s, respectively. Leakey also encouraged and supported many other PhD candidates, most notably from Cambridge University.

== Last years ==

During his final years Louis became famous as a lecturer in the United Kingdom and United States. He did not excavate any longer, as he was crippled with [[arthritis]], for which he had a hip replacement in 1968. He raised funds and directed his family and associates. In Kenya he was a facilitator for hundreds of scientists exploring the [[East African Rift]] system for fossils.

In 1968, Louis refused an honorary doctorate from the [[University of the Witwatersrand|University of Witwatersrand]] in Johannesburg, primarily because of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]. Mary accepted one, and they thereafter led separate professional lives.<ref>Morell Chapter 23, "Mining Hominids at Olduvai".</ref>

In the last few years Louis' health began to fail more seriously. He had his first heart attacks and spent six months in the hospital. An empathy over health brought him and [[Dian Fossey]] together for a brief romance, which she broke off. Richard began to assume more and more of his father's responsibilities, which Louis resisted, but in the end was forced to accept.<ref>Morell, Chapters 27-30.</ref>

==Death and legacy==
They faced the question of a memorial marker for a year. When Richard went to place a stone on the grave he found one already there, courtesy of Louis' former secretary Rosalie Osborn. The inscription was signed with the letters, ''ILYFA'', "I'll love you forever always", which Rosalie used to place on her letters to him. Richard left it in place.<ref>Morell, Chapter 30, "An End and a Beginning".</ref>

===Prominent organizations===
* In 1947, Leakey was central to the organisation of the first [[PanAfrican Archaeological Association]] congress, held in Nairobi. From 1955 to 1959 he was its President.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Congresses and Presidents – PanAfrican Archaeological Association|url=http://www.panafprehistory.org/en/static/previous-congress-proceedings|access-date=2021-10-22|website=www.panafprehistory.org}}</ref>
*In 1958, Leakey founded the Tigoni Primate Research Center with Cynthia Booth, on her farm north of Nairobi. Later it was the National Primate Research Center, currently the Institute of Primate Research, now in Nairobi. As the Tigoni center, it funded Leakey's Angels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}
* In 1961, Leakey created the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the same grounds as Coryndon Museum, appointing himself director.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}
* In 1968, Leakey assisted with the founding of [http://www.leakeyfoundation.org/ The Leakey Foundation], to ensure the legacy of his life's work in the study of human origins.  The Leakey Foundation exists today as the number-one funder of human-origins research in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Prominent family members===
Louis Leakey was married to [[Mary Leakey]], who made the noteworthy discovery of fossil footprints at [[Laetoli]]. Found preserved in volcanic ash in [[Tanzania]], they are the earliest record of bipedal gait.

He is also the father of [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[Richard Leakey]] and the botanist [[Colin Leakey]]. Louis's cousin, [[Nigel Gray Leakey]], was a recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]] during World War II.
