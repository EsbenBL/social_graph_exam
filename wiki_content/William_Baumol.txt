'''William Jack Baumol''' (February 26, 1922 – May 4, 2017) was an American [[economist]]. He was a professor of [[economics]] at [[New York University]], Academic Director of the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Professor Emeritus at [[Princeton University]]. He was a prolific author of more than eighty books and several hundred journal articles.<ref>{{cite web

|access-date=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

Baumol wrote extensively about [[labor market]] and other economic factors that affect the economy. He also made significant contributions to the theory of [[entrepreneurship]] and the [[history of economic thought]]. He is among the most influential economists in the world according to [[RePEc|IDEAS/RePEc]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1971.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref>

Baumol was considered a candidate for the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for 2003,<ref>{{cite web

|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> but he died without receiving the prize.

==Early life==
Baumol was born in the South Bronx. His parents, Solomon and Lillian, were both immigrants from Eastern Europe.<ref name="TimesObit">{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Patricia |title=William J.

Baumol studied at the [[City College of New York]] and was awarded his bachelor's degree in 1942. After college, he served in the [[U.S. Army]] in [[World War II]] and later worked for the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] as an economist.<ref name="TimesObit"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Krueger |first=Alan |title=An Interview With William J Baumol |url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/health/18baumol-doc.pdf |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=15 |year=2001|issue=3 |pages=211–231 |doi=10.1257/jep.15.3.211 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Education==

He was initially denied entry to the doctoral studies at the [[London School of Economics]] and was instead admitted to the Master's program. After witnessing his debating skills at Lord [[Lionel Robbins]]' seminars, he was within weeks switched to the doctoral program and also admitted to the faculty as an Assistant Lecturer.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news|last=Krueger|first=Alan|title=An Interview with William J.

==Teaching==

While a professor at [[Princeton University]] he supervised some graduate students who would eventually become very well-known economists, including [[Burton Malkiel]], [[William G. Bowen]], and [[Harold Tafler Shapiro]].<ref name="pubs.aeaweb.org">{{cite news|last=Krueger|first=Alan|title=An Interview with William J.

William Baumol also contributed to the transformation of the field of [[finance]], and published contributions to the areas of efficiency of [[capital markets]], [[portfolio theory]], and [[capital budgeting]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Chapter 11, William Baumol and the Development of the Field of Finance, in Prices, Competition and Equilibrium: Essays in Honour of William J Baumol|first1=Burton|last1=Malkiel |year=1986|publisher=Oxford|chapter=11 |isbn=9780860030690|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GqAOisFfgYYC&q=William+Baumol+and+the+Development+of+the+Field+of+Finance%2C+in+Prices%2C+Competition+and+Equilibrium&pg=PA214 }}</ref>

===Entrepreneurship===
The place of the disruptive innovations and innovative entrepreneurs in traditional economic theory (which describes many efficiency-based ratios assuming uniform outputs) presents theoretic quandaries. Baumol contributed greatly to this area of economic theory. The 2006 Annual Meetings of the [[American Economic Association]] held a special session in his name, and honoring his many years of work in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation,<ref name="Econ">

The British news magazine, ''[[The Economist]]'' published an article about William Baumol and his lifelong work to develop a place in economic theory for the [[entrepreneur]] (March 11, 2006, pp 68), much of which owes its genesis to [[Joseph Schumpeter]]. They note that traditional [[microeconomic]] theory normally holds a place for 'prices' and 'firms' but not for that (seemingly) important engine of innovation, the entrepreneur. Baumol is given credit for helping to remedy this shortcoming: "Thanks to Mr. Baumol's own painstaking efforts, economists now have a bit more room for entrepreneurs in their theories."

William Baumol's book, ''The Microtheory of Innovative Entrepreneurship''<ref>{{cite book

|title=The Microtheory of Innovative Entrepreneurship
|date=May 2010
|publisher=Princeton University Press
|isbn=9780691145846
}}</ref> is the first formal theoretical analysis of the role of innovative entrepreneurs.

==Textbooks==
Baumol wrote several textbooks in economics, including an introductory textbook with [[Alan Blinder]] titled ''Macroeconomics: Principles and Policy''.<ref>{{cite web
