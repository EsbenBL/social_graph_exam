He taught at [[Columbia University]] from 1973 to 1980 and the [[Woodrow Wilson School]] and Economics Department of Princeton University from 1980 to 1984 before returning to Stanford.  He has received several teaching prizes and teaches Stanford's introductory economics course as well as Ph.D. courses in monetary economics.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = John B. | title = Curriculum vitae | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~johntayl/cv/TaylorCV-Jan-2012.pdf | publisher = [[Stanford University]] }}</ref>

In research published in 1979 and 1980 he developed a model of price and wage setting—called the staggered contract model—which served as an underpinning of a new class of empirical models with rational expectations and sticky prices—sometimes called new Keynesian models.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = John B. | title = Staggered wage setting in a macro model | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–113 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] | date = May 1979 | jstor = 1801626 }}

Taylor contributed to the development of mathematical methods for solving [[macroeconomic model]]s under the assumption of [[rational expectations]], including in a 1975 ''Journal of Political Economy'' paper, in which he showed how gradual learning could be incorporated in models with rational expectations;<ref>{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = John B. | title = Monetary policy during a transition to rational expectations | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 1009–22 | jstor = 1830083 | doi = 10.1086/260374 | date = October 1975 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.740.3676 | s2cid = 8603588 }}</ref> a 1979 ''Econometrica'' paper in which he presented one of the first econometric models with overlapping price setting and rational expectations,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = John B. | title = Estimation and control of a macroeconomic model with rational expectations | journal = [[Econometrica]] | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 1267–86 | doi = 10.2307/1911962 | date = September 1979 | jstor = 1911962 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.741.8996 }}</ref> which he later expanded into a large multicountry model in a 1993 book ''Macroeconomic Policy in a World Economy'',<ref name="operation" /> and a 1983 ''Econometrica'' paper,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = John B. | last2 = Fair | first2 = Ray C. | title = Solution and maximum likelihood estimation of dynamic nonlinear rational expectations models | journal = [[Econometrica]] | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 1169–85 | jstor = 1912057 | doi = 10.2307/1912057 | date = July 1983 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.75.6815 | s2cid = 122888958 }}</ref> in which he developed with Ray Fair the first algorithm to solve large-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models which became part of popular solution programs such as [[Dynare]] and [[EViews]].<ref>{{citation | last1 = Judd | first1 = Kenneth | last2 = Kubler | first2 = Felix | last3 = Schmedders | first3 = Karl | contribution = Computational methods for dynamic equilibria with heterogeneous agents | editor-last1 = Dewatripont | editor-first1 = Mathias | editor-last2 = Hansen | editor-first2 = Lars Peter | editor-last3 = Turnovsky | editor-first3 = Stephen J.  | title = Advances in economics and econometrics theory and applications (volume 3) | page = 247 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, U.K. New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781280163388 }} and “Eviews Users Guide II.”</ref>

In 1977, Taylor and [[Edmund Phelps]], simultaneously with [[Stanley Fischer]], showed that monetary policy is useful for stabilizing the economy if prices or wages are [[Sticky (economics)|sticky]], even when all workers and firms have rational expectations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = John B. | last2 = Phelps | first2 = Edmund S. | title = Stabilizing powers of monetary policy under rational expectations | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–90 | jstor = 1828334 | doi = 10.1086/260550 | date = February 1977 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.741.1432 | s2cid = 14729818 }}</ref> This demonstrated that some of the earlier insights of [[Keynesian economics]] remained true under rational expectations. This was important because [[Thomas Sargent]] and [[Neil Wallace]] had argued that rational expectations would make [[Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition|macroeconomic policy useless for stabilization]];<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sargent | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Wallace | first2 = Neil | title = 'Rational' expectations, the optimal monetary instrument, and the optimal money supply rule | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 241–54 | jstor = 1830921 | doi = 10.1086/260321 | date = April 1975 | s2cid = 154301791 }}</ref> the results of Taylor, Phelps, and Fischer showed that Sargent and Wallace's crucial assumption was not rational expectations, but perfectly flexible prices.<ref>{{citation | last = Blanchard | first = Olivier | contribution = Epliogue | editor-last = Blanchard | editor-first = Olivier | title = Macroeconomics | page = 543 | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | year = 2000 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780130557872 | postscript = .}}</ref> These research projects together could considerably deepen our understanding of the limits of the [[policy-ineffectiveness proposition]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |title=The theory of new classical macroeconomics: a positive critique |location=Heidelberg / New York / Dordrecht / London |publisher=Springer |year=2015 |isbn= 9783319175782 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-17578-2 |series=Contributions to Economics }}</ref>

Taylor then developed the [[Taylor Contracts (economics)|staggered contract model]] of overlapping wage and price setting, which became one of the building blocks of the [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian macroeconomics]] that rebuilt much of the traditional macromodel on rational expectations [[microfoundations]].<ref>{{citation | last1 = King | first1 = Robert G. | last2 = Wolman | first2 = Alexander | contribution = What should the monetary authority do when prices are sticky? | editor-last = Taylor | editor-first = John B. | title = Monetary policy rules | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780226791265 | postscript = .}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Taylor | first = John B. | contribution = Staggered price and wage setting in macroeconomics | editor-last1 = Taylor | editor-first1 = John B. | editor-last2 = Woodford | editor-first2 = Michael | title = Handbook of macroeconomics | pages = 1009–50 | publisher = North-Holland Elsevier | location = Amsterdam New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780444501585 | postscript = .}}</ref>

Taylor's research on [[monetary policy]] rules traces back to his undergraduate studies at Princeton.<ref>{{cite thesis |degree= BA |last=Taylor |first=John B. | date = April 1968 |title=Fiscal and monetary stabilization policies in a model of endogenous cyclical growth |publisher= [[Princeton University]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=John B. |title=Fiscal and monetary stabilization policies in a model of endogenous cyclical growth |journal=Research Memorandum No. 104 |publisher=Econometric Research Program, Princeton University |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~erp/ERParchives/archivepdfs/M104.pdf | date = October 1968 | oclc = 22687344 }}</ref>
He went on in the 1970s and 1980s to explore what types of monetary policy rules would most effectively reduce the social costs of inflation and [[Welfare cost of business cycles|business cycle fluctuations]]: should central banks try to control the money supply, the price level, or the interest rate; and should these instruments react to changes in output, unemployment, asset prices, or inflation rates? He showed<ref>{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = John B. | title = Estimation and control of a macroeconomic model with rational expectations | journal = [[Econometrica]] | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 1267–86 | jstor = 1911962 | doi = 10.2307/1911962 | date = September 1979 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.741.8996 }}</ref> that there was a tradeoff—later called the '''Taylor curve'''<ref>{{cite book | last = Bernanke | first = Ben | author-link = Ben Bernanke | title = The Great Moderation | date = 2004 }} Remarks at the meeting of the Eastern Economic Association.</ref>—between the volatility of inflation and that of output. Taylor's 1993 paper in the ''Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy'' proposed that a simple and effective central bank policy would manipulate short-term interest rates, raising rates to cool the economy whenever inflation or output growth becomes excessive, and lowering rates when either one falls too low.<ref name="Discretion" /> Taylor's interest rate equation has come to be known as the '''[[Taylor rule]]''', and it is now widely accepted as an effective formula for monetary decision making.<ref>{{cite book | last = Orphanides | first = Athanasios | title = Taylor rules | url = http://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/FEDS/2007/200718/200718pap.pdf | series = Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007–18 | publisher = Federal Reserve Board | year = 2007 }}</ref>

A key stipulation of the Taylor rule, sometimes called the '''Taylor principle''',<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davig | first1 = Troy | last2 = Leeper | first2 = Eric M. | title = Generalizing the Taylor Principle | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 97 | issue = 3 | pages = 607–35 | date = June 2007 | jstor = 30035014 | doi = 10.1257/aer.97.3.607 | url = https://caepr.indiana.edu/RePEc/inu/caeprp/CAEPR2006-001.pdf }}</ref> is that the nominal interest rate should increase by more than one percentage point for each one-percent rise in inflation. Some empirical estimates indicate that many central banks today act approximately as the Taylor rule prescribes, but violated the Taylor principle during the inflationary spiral of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clarida | first1 = Richard | last2 = Galí | first2 = Jordi | last3 = Gertler | first3 = Mark | title = Monetary policy rules and macroeconomic stability: evidence and some theory | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 115 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–80 | doi= 10.1162/003355300554692 | date = February 2000 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.111.7984 | s2cid = 5448436 }} [http://www.nyu.edu/econ/user/gertlerm/qje00.pdf Pdf.]</ref>

==Recent research==
Taylor's recent research has been on the financial crisis that began in 2007 and the [[Late-2000s recession|world economic recession]]. He finds that the crisis was primarily caused by flawed macroeconomic policies from the U.S. government and other governments. Particularly, he focuses on the [[Federal Reserve]] which, under [[Alan Greenspan]], a personal friend of Taylor, created "monetary excesses" in which [[interest rates]] were kept too low for too long, which [[Causes of the United States housing bubble#Historically low interest rates|then directly led to]] the housing boom in his opinion.<ref>{{citation | last = Taylor | first = John B. | contribution = Housing and monetary policy | editor-last = Reserve Bank of Kansas City | title = Housing, housing finance, and monetary policy: a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 30-September 1, 2007 | pages = 463–76 | publisher = Reserve Bank of Kansas City | location = Kansas City, Missouri | year = 2008 | oclc = 170267547 }}</ref> He also believes that [[Freddie Mac]] and [[Fannie Mae]] spurred on the boom and that the crisis was misdiagnosed as a liquidity rather than a credit risk problem.<ref>{{citation | last = Taylor | first = John B. | contribution = The financial crisis and the policy response: an empirical analysis of what went wrong (housing and monetary policy) | editor-last = Bank of Canada Staff | title = Festschrift in honour of David Dodge's contributions to Canadian public policy: proceedings of a conference held by the Bank of Canada, November, 2008 | pages = 1–18 | publisher = Bank of Canada | location = Ottawa | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780660199276 | postscript = .}}</ref> He wrote that, "government actions and interventions, not any inherent failure or instability of the private economy, caused, prolonged, and worsen the crisis."<ref>{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = John B. | title = How government created the financial crisis | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123414310280561945 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = February 9, 2009 | page = A19 }} [https://web.stanford.edu/~johntayl/How_Government_Created_the_Financial_Crisis-WSJ-2-9-09.pdf Pdf.]</ref>

Taylor's research has also examined the impact of fiscal policy in the recent recession. In November 2008, writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' opinion section, he recommended four measures to fight the economic downturn: ''(a)'' permanently keeping all [[Income tax in the United States|income tax rates]] the same, ''(b)'' permanently creating a worker's tax credit equal to 6.2 percent of wages up to $8,000, ''(c)'' incorporating "[[automatic stabilizers]]" as part of overall fiscal plans, and  ''(d)'' enacting a short-term [[Stimulus (economic)|stimulus]] plan that also meets long-term objectives against [[Pork barrel|waste]] and [[Economic efficiency|inefficiency]]. He stated that merely temporary [[tax cuts]] would not serve as a good policy tool.<ref>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=John B.|title=Why permanent tax cuts are the best stimulus|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122757149157954723|date=November 25, 2008|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=June 30, 2011}}</ref> His research<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = John B. | last2 = Cogan | first2 = John F. | last3 = Cwik | first3 = Tobias | last4 = Wieland | first4 = Volker  | title = New Keynesian versus old Keynesian government spending multipliers | journal = [[Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control]] | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 281–95 | doi= 10.1016/j.jedc.2010.01.010 | date = March 2010 | s2cid = 14892522 }}</ref> with John Cogan, Tobias Cwik, and Volcker Wieland showed that the  multiplier is much smaller in new Keynesian than in old Keynesian models, a result that was confirmed by researchers at central banks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Coenen | first1 = Guenter | title = Effects of fiscal stimulus in structural models | journal = [[American Economic Journal|American Economic Journal: Microeconomics]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–68 | doi= 10.1257/mac.4.1.22 | date = September 2011 | s2cid = 154561165 | url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=23671 |display-authors=etal}} [https://web.stanford.edu/~kumhof/modelcomparison2010.pdf Pdf.]</ref> He evaluated the 2008 and 2009 stimulus packages and argued that they were not effective in stimulating the economy.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = John B. | title = An empirical analysis of the revival of fiscal activism in the 2000s | journal = [[Journal of Economic Literature]] | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 686–702 | doi= 10.1257/jel.49.3.686 | jstor = 23071727 | date = September 2011 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.359.9195 }} [https://web.stanford.edu/~johntayl/JEL_Taylor_Final%20Pages.pdf Pdf.]</ref>

In a June 2011 interview on [[Bloomberg Television]], Taylor stressed the importance of long term fiscal reform that sets the [[United States federal budget|U.S. federal budget]] on a path towards being balanced. He cautioned that the Fed should move away from [[quantitative easing]] measures and keep to a more static, stable monetary policy. He also criticized fellow economist [[Paul Krugman]]'s advocacy of additional stimulus programs from Congress, which Taylor said will not help in the long run.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/taylor-says-us-needs-sound-monetary-fiscal-policies/2011/06/27/AG1MTsnH_video.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112165652/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/taylor-says-us-needs-sound-monetary-fiscal-policies/2011/06/27/AG1MTsnH_video.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 12, 2012|title=Taylor Says U.S. Needs 'Sound' Monetary, Fiscal Policies|access-date=June 30, 2011|date=June 27, 2011|publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]] thru [[Washington Post]]}}</ref> In his 2012 book ''First Principles: Five Keys to Restoring America’s Prosperity'', he endeavors to explain why these reforms are part of a broader set of principles of economic freedom.
