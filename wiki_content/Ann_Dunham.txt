'''Stanley Ann Dunham''' (November 29, 1942&nbsp;– November 7, 1995) was an American [[anthropology|anthropologist]] who specialized in the [[economic anthropology]] and [[rural development]] of [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Surviving-against-the-Odds/ |title=S. Ann Dunham – Surviving against the Odds: Village Industry in Indonesia |publisher=Dukeupress.edu |access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref> She was the mother of [[Barack Obama]], the 44th [[president of the United States]]. Dunham was known as Stanley Ann Dunham through high school, then as Ann Dunham, Ann Obama, Ann Soetoro, a.k.a. Ann Sutoro, and resumed her maiden name, Ann Dunham, later in life.'''<ref name="Scott 2011, p. 6">Scott (2011), <span class="plainlinks">[https://books.google.com/books?id=pMPnso6wakAC&pg=PT9 p. 6]</span>
<blockquote>Anyone writing about Dunham's life must address the question of what to call her. She was Stanley Ann Dunham at birth and Stanley Ann as a child, but dropped the Stanley upon graduating from high school. She was Ann Dunham, then Ann Obama, then Ann Soetoro until her second divorce. Then she kept her husband's name but modernized the spelling to Sutoro. In the early 1980s, she was Ann Sutoro, Ann Dunham Sutoro, S. Ann Dunham Sutoro. In conversation, Indonesians who worked with her in the late 1980s and early 1990s referred to her as Ann Dunham, putting the emphasis on the second syllable of the surname. Toward the end of her life, she signed her dissertation S. Ann Dunham and official correspondence (Stanley) Ann Dunham.<br /><br /><span class="plainlinks">[https://books.google.com/books?id=pMPnso6wakAC&pg=PT160 p. 363]</span>:<br />''modernized the spelling:'' The spelling of certain Indonesian words changed after Indonesia gained its independence from the Dutch in 1949, and again under a 1972 agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia... Names containing ''oe'',... are now often spelled with a ''u''... However, older spellings are still used in some personal names... After her divorce from Lolo Soetoro, Ann Dunham kept his last name for a number of years while she was still working in Indonesia, but she changed the spelling to Sutoro. Their daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, chose to keep the traditional spelling of her Indonesian surname.</blockquote></ref>'''

Born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], Dunham studied at the [[East–West Center]] and at the [[University of Hawaii]] at Manoa in Honolulu, where she attained a bachelor of arts degree in anthropology (1967),<ref>The University of Hawaii at Manoa Department of Anthropology says Ann Dunham received a B.A. in anthropology in August 1967 and contemporaneous correspondence in 1966 and 1967 between S. Ann Soetoro and the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] makes repeated references to her obtaining a BA in anthropology in 1967.</ref> and later received master of arts (1974) and PhD (1992) degrees, also in anthropology.<ref name="anthropology">{{cite journal

Interested in craftsmanship, weaving, and the role of women in [[cottage industries]], Dunham's research focused on women's work on the island of [[Java]] and blacksmithing in Indonesia. To address the problem of poverty in rural villages, she created [[microcredit]] programs while working as a consultant for the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. Dunham was also employed by the [[Ford Foundation]] in [[Jakarta]] and she consulted with the [[Asian Development Bank]] in [[Gujranwala]], [[Pakistan]]. Towards the latter part of her life, she worked with [[Bank Rakyat Indonesia]], where she helped apply her research to the largest [[microfinance]] program in the world.<ref name="anthropology"/>

After her son was elected President, interest renewed in Dunham's work: the University of Hawaii held a symposium about her research; an exhibition of Dunham's Indonesian [[batik]] textile collection toured the United States; and in December 2009, [[Duke University Press]] published ''Surviving against the Odds: Village Industry in Indonesia'', a book based on Dunham's original 1992 dissertation. Janny Scott, an author and former ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter, published a biography about Ann Dunham's life titled ''A Singular Woman'' in 2011. Posthumous interest has also led to the creation of The Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowment in the Anthropology Department at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]], as well as the Ann Dunham Soetoro Graduate Fellowships, intended to fund students associated with the [[East–West Center]] (EWC) in [[Honolulu|Honolulu, Hawaii]].<ref name="The Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowed Fund">{{cite web |title= The Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowed Fund|url= http://www.uhfoundation.org/donor_resources/giving_opportunities/dunhamsoetoro_endowed_fund.aspx |access-date=January 2, 2012}}</ref>

From May to November 1986 and from August to November 1987, Dunham was a cottage industries development consultant for the [[Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited|Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan]] (ADBP) under the Gujranwala Integrated Rural Development Project (GADP).<ref name="Mizan 2008"/><ref name="Dunham 2009"/> The credit component of the project was implemented in the [[Gujranwala District|Gujranwala]] district of the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]] with funding from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], with the credit component implemented through [[Louis Berger Group|Louis Berger International, Inc]].<ref name="Mizan 2008"/><ref name="Dunham 2009"/> Dunham worked closely with the [[Lahore]] office of the Punjab Small Industries Corporation (PSIC).<ref name="Mizan 2008"/><ref name="Dunham 2009"/>

From January 1988 to 1995, Dunham was a consultant and research coordinator for Indonesia's oldest bank, [[Bank Rakyat Indonesia]] (BRI) in Jakarta, with her work funded by USAID and the [[World Bank]].<ref name="Mizan 2008"/><ref name="Dunham 2009"/> In March 1993, Dunham was a research and policy coordinator for [[Women's World Banking]] (WWB) in New York.<ref name="Mizan 2008"/> She helped WWB manage the Expert Group Meeting on Women and Finance in New York in January 1994, and helped the WWB take prominent roles in the UN's [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] held September 4–15, 1995 in [[Beijing]], and in the UN regional conferences and NGO forums that preceded it.<ref name="Mizan 2008"/>

On August 9, 1992, she was awarded [[PhD]] in [[anthropology]] from the University of Hawaii, under the supervision of Prof. [[Alice G.

Ann |title=Peasant blacksmithing in Indonesia : surviving against all odds |location=Honolulu |publisher=University of Hawaii|year=1992 |oclc=65874559 }}</ref> Anthropologist Michael Dove described the dissertation as "a classic, in-depth, on-the-ground anthropological study of a 1,200-year-old industry".<ref name="Dove">{{cite news |author=Dove, Michael R. |date=August 11, 2009 |title= Dreams from his mother |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A21 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/opinion/11dove.html |access-date=August 11, 2009}}</ref> According to Dove, Dunham's dissertation challenged popular perceptions regarding economically and politically marginalized groups, and countered the notions that the roots of poverty lie with the poor themselves and that cultural differences are responsible for the gap between less-developed countries and the industrialized West.<ref name="Dove"/> According to Dove, Dunham
<blockquote>found that the villagers she studied in Central Java had many of the same economic needs, beliefs and aspirations as the most capitalist of Westerners. Village craftsmen were "keenly interested in profits", she wrote, and entrepreneurship was "in plentiful supply in rural Indonesia", having been "part of the traditional culture" there for a millennium.<br /><br />Based on these observations, Dr. Soetoro concluded that underdevelopment in these communities resulted from a scarcity of capital, the allocation of which was a matter of politics, not culture. Antipoverty programs that ignored this reality had the potential, perversely, of exacerbating inequality because they would only reinforce the power of elites. As she wrote in her dissertation, "many government programs inadvertently foster stratification by channeling resources through village officials", who then used the money to strengthen their own status further.<ref name="Dove"/></blockquote>

Dunham produced a large amount of professional papers that are held in collections of the [[National Anthropological Archives]] (NAA). Her daughter donated a collection of them that is categorized as the ''S. Ann Dunham papers, 1965-2013''. This collection contains case studies, correspondence, field notebooks, lectures, photographs, reports, research files, research proposals, surveys, and floppy disks documenting her dissertation research on blacksmithing, as well as her professional work as a consultant for organizations such as the Ford Foundation and the Bank Raykat Indonesia (BRI). They are housed at the [[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]].

Her field notes have been digitized and, in 2020, [[Smithsonian Magazine]] noted that an effort had been established for a project to transcribe them.<ref>Sexton, Courtney, ''[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/help-transcribe-field-notes-penned-ann-dunham-pioneering-anthropologist-barack-obama-mother-180975310/ Help Transcribe Field Notes Penned by S.

==Illness and death==
In late 1994, Dunham was living and working in Indonesia. One night, during dinner at a friend's house in Jakarta, she experienced stomach pain. A visit to a local physician led to an initial diagnosis of indigestion.<ref name="ripley"/> Dunham returned to the United States in early 1995 and was examined at the [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center]] in New York City and diagnosed with [[uterine cancer]]. By this time, the cancer had spread to her ovaries.<ref name="maraniss" /> She moved back to Hawaii to live near her widowed mother and died on November 7, 1995, 22 days short of her 53rd birthday.<ref>{{cite news |title=Obituaries: Stanley Ann Dunham |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/273241962/?terms=Stanley%2BAnn%2BDunham |access-date=July 13, 2018 |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=November 14, 1995 |page=C12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Obituaries: Stanley Ann Dunham |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/265806989/?terms=Ann%2BDunham |access-date=July 13, 2018 |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=November 17, 1995 |page=D6}}</ref><ref name=freespirit /><ref>{{cite news |author=Chipman, Kim |date=February 11, 2008 |title=Obama drive gets inspiration from his white mom born in Kansas |publisher=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aOOwMgWY_VIA&refer=home |access-date=February 11, 2008}}</ref><ref name=mccormick>{{cite news |author=McCormick, John |date=September 21, 2007 |title=Obama's mother in new ad |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page= 3 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-09-21/news/0709210249_1_universal-coverage-health-care-health-care-proposal |access-date=January 17, 2008}}</ref> Following a memorial service at the University of Hawaii, Obama and his sister spread their mother's ashes in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at [[Koko Head|Lanai Lookout]] on the south side of [[Oahu]].<ref name=freespirit /> Obama scattered the ashes of his grandmother [[Madelyn Dunham]] in the same spot on December 23, 2008, weeks after his election to the presidency.<ref>{{cite news |date=December 24, 2008 |title=Obama bids farewell to grandmother (photo gallery) |newspaper=New York Post |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/item_KwpspRXF4w7dC0GEIWSNbN |access-date=December 25, 2008}}</ref>

Obama talked about Dunham's death in a 30-second campaign advertisement ("Mother") arguing for health care reform. The ad featured a photograph of Dunham holding a young Obama in her arms as Obama talks about her last days worrying about expensive medical bills.<ref name=mccormick/> The topic also came up in a 2007 speech in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]:<ref name=mccormick/>

<blockquote>I remember my mother. She was 52 years old when she died of ovarian cancer, and you know what she was thinking about in the last months of her life? She wasn't thinking about getting well. She wasn't thinking about coming to terms with her own mortality. She had been diagnosed just as she was transitioning between jobs. And she wasn't sure whether insurance was going to cover the medical expenses because they might consider this a preexisting condition. I remember just being heartbroken, seeing her struggle through the paperwork and the medical bills and the insurance forms. So, I have seen what it's like when somebody you love is suffering because of a broken health care system. And it's wrong. It's not who we are as a people.<ref name=mccormick/></blockquote>
