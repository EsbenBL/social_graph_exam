'''Social constructionism''' is  a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] in [[sociology]] and [[communication theory]] that examines the development of jointly-constructed understandings of the world that form the basis for shared assumptions about [[reality]]. The theory centers on the notion that meanings are developed in coordination with others rather than separately within each individual.<ref>{{cite book|first=Wendy|last=Leeds-Hurwitz|chapter=Social construction of reality|title=Encyclopedia of communication theory|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediacomm00litt|url-access=limited|editor1-first=Stephen W.|editor1-last=Littlejohn|editor2-first=Karen A.|editor2-last=Foss|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Thousand Oaks, California|date=2009|doi=10.4135/9781412959384.n344|isbn= 978-1-4129-5937-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediacomm00litt/page/n959 891]}}</ref> It has often been characterised as neo-Marxian or also as a neo-Kantian theory, in that social constructionism replaces the transcendental subject with a concept of society that is at the same time descriptive and [[Normativity|normative]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Heartfield|first=James|title=Marxism and social construction|date=1996|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-24669-4_2|work=Marxism, Mysticism and Modern Theory|pages=7–27|editor-last=Wolton|editor-first=Suke|series=St Antony’s Series|place=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-24669-4_2|isbn=978-1-349-24669-4|access-date=2021-09-28}}</ref>

There is weak and strong social constructionism.<ref name=":12" /> Weak social constructionism relies on [[brute fact]]s – facts that are not socially constructed, such as, arguably, facts about physical particles – or institutional facts (which are formed from [[social conventions]]).<ref name=":12" /> 

It has been objected that strong social constructionism undermines the foundation of science as the pursuit of objectivity and, as a theory, defies any attempt at falsifying it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Koertge|first=Noretta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZPmCwAAQBAJ|title=A House Built on Sand: Exposing Postmodernist Myths about Science|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-511726-4|language=en}}</ref>

== Overview ==
A social construct or construction is the meaning, notion, or connotation placed on an object or event by a society, and adopted by the inhabitants of that society with respect to how they view or deal with the object or event.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/social-constructionism|title=Social Constructionism {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=23 December 2018}}</ref>

Social constructionism posits that phenomena do not have an independent foundation outside the mental and linguistic representation that people develop about them throughout their history, and which becomes their shared [[reality]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcma84waN3AC&q=The+Social+Construction+of+Reality:+A+Treatise+in+the+Sociology+of+Knowledge|title=The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge|last2=Luckmann|first2=Thomas|date=2011-04-26|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1-4532-1546-3|language=en}}</ref> From a linguistic viewpoint, social constructionism centres meaning as an internal reference within language (words refer to words, definitions to other definitions) rather than to an external reality.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mallon|first=Ron|title=Naturalistic Approaches to Social Construction|date=2019|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/social-construction-naturalistic/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2019|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2021-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=St. Clair|first=Robert N.|date=1982-10-01|title=Language and the social construction of reality|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0388000182800065|journal=Language Sciences|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=221–236|doi=10.1016/S0388-0001(82)80006-5|issn=0388-0001}}</ref>

== Origins ==

[[File:Diagram of constructed reality.svg|thumb|Each person creates their own "constructed reality" that drives their behaviors.]]

In the 16th century, [[Michel de Montaigne]] wrote that, "We need to interpret interpretations more than to interpret things."<ref>Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey & Donato (1970). pp. 278. Derrida quotes Montagne</ref> In 1886 or 1887, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] put it similarly: [[wikiquote:Friedrich Nietzsche#Quotes|"Facts do not exist, only interpretations."]] In his 1922 book [[Public Opinion (book)|''Public Opinion'']], [[Walter Lippmann]] said, "The real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance" between people and their environment. Each person constructs a pseudo-environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged mental image of the world, and to a degree, everyone's pseudo-environment is a fiction. People "live in the same world, but they think and feel in different ones."<ref>{{cite Q|Q1768450}}<!-- Public Opinion -->, pp.  16, 20.</ref>  Lippman's "environment" might be called "reality", and his "pseudo-environment" seems equivalent to what today is called "constructed reality".

Social constructionism has more recently been rooted in "[[symbolic interactionism]]" and "phenomenology".<ref>{{cite book|first=David |last=Woodruff Smith|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|contribution-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/phenomenology/|contribution=Phenomenology |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2018|issn=1095-5054|location=Stanford, California|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title-link=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|first1 = Gail T.|last1 = Fairhurst|first2 = David|last2 = Grant|title = The Social Construction of Leadership: A Sailing Guide|journal = [[Management Communication Quarterly]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Thouisand Oaks, California|date = 1 May 2010|issn = 0893-3189|pages = 171–210|volume = 24|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0893318909359697|s2cid = 145363598|language = en}}</ref> With Berger and Luckmann's [[The Social Construction of Reality]] published in 1966, this concept found its hold. More than four decades later, much theory and research pledged itself to the basic tenet that people "make their social and cultural worlds at the same time these worlds make them."<ref name=":1"/> It is a viewpoint that uproots social processes "simultaneously playful and serious, by which reality is both revealed and concealed, created and destroyed by our activities."<ref name=":1"/> It provides a substitute to the "Western intellectual tradition" where the researcher "earnestly seeks certainty in a representation of reality by means of propositions."<ref name=":1"/>

In social constructionist terms, "taken-for-granted realities" are cultivated from "interactions between and among social agents;" furthermore, reality is not some objective truth "waiting to be uncovered through positivist scientific inquiry."<ref name=":1" /> Rather, there can be "multiple realities that compete for truth and legitimacy."<ref name=":1"/> Social constructionism understands the "fundamental role of language and communication" and this understanding has "contributed to the linguistic turn" and more recently the "turn to [[discourse]] theory."<ref name=":1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/janettie/discourse-theory|title=Discourse Theory|last=Janet Tibaldo|date=19 September 2013}}</ref> The majority of social constructionists abide by the belief that "language does not mirror reality; rather, it constitutes [creates] it."<ref name=":1"/>

A broad definition of social constructionism has its supporters and critics in the organizational sciences.<ref name=":1"/> A constructionist approach to various organizational and managerial phenomena appear to be more commonplace and on the rise.<ref name=":1"/>

Andy Lock and Tom Strong trace some of the fundamental tenets of social constructionism back to the work of the 18th-century Italian political philosopher, rhetorician, historian, and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite book|first1=Andy|last1=Lock|first2=Tom|last2=Strong|title=Social Constructionism: Sources and Stirrings in Theory and Practice|url=https://archive.org/details/socialconstructi00lock|url-access=limited|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, New York|date=2010|isbn=978-0521708357|pages=[https://archive.org/details/socialconstructi00lock/page/n31 12]–29}}</ref>

Berger and Luckmann give credit to [[Max Scheler]] as a large influence as he created the idea of [[Sociology of knowledge]] which influenced social construction theory.<ref>Leeds-Hurwitz, pgs. 8-9</ref>

According to Lock and Strong, other influential thinkers whose work has affected the development of social constructionism are: [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Alfred Schutz]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Valentin Volosinov]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Ken Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], [[Rom Harre]], and John Shotter.<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

== Applications ==
===Personal construct psychology===
Since its appearance in the 1950s, [[personal construct psychology]] (PCP) has mainly developed as a constructivist theory of personality and a system of transforming individual [[meaning-making]] processes, largely in therapeutic contexts.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Donald|last1=Bannister|first2=John Miller|last2=Mair|title=The Evaluation of Personal Constructs|url=https://archive.org/details/evaluationofpers0000bann|url-access=registration|publisher=Academic Press|location=London, England|date=1968|isbn=978-0120779505|page=[https://archive.org/details/evaluationofpers0000bann/page/164 164]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=George|last=Kelly|author-link=George Kelly (psychologist)|title=The Psychology of Personal Constructs|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyofpers02kell|url-access=registration|publisher=[[W.W.

A usual way of thinking about the relationship between PCP and SC is treating them as two separate entities that are similar in some aspects, but also very different in others. This way of conceptualizing this relationship is a logical result of the circumstantial differences of their emergence. In subsequent analyses these differences between PCP and SC were framed around several points of tension, formulated as binary oppositions: personal/social; individualist/relational; agency/structure; constructivist/constructionist.<ref>Botella, L.

Reframing the relationship between PCP and SC may be of use in both the PCP and the SC communities. On one hand, it extends and enriches SC theory and points to benefits of applying the PCP "toolkit" in constructionist therapy and research. On the other hand, the reframing contributes to PCP theory and points to new ways of addressing social construction in therapeutic conversations.<ref name="Theory & Psychology"/>

===Educational psychology===
Like social constructionism, [[social constructivism]] states that people work together to construct [[Social artifact|artifacts]]. While social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, social constructivism focuses on an individual's learning that takes place because of his or her interactions in a group.

Social constructivism has been studied by many educational psychologists, who are concerned with its implications for teaching and learning. For more on the psychological dimensions of social constructivism, see the work of [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] and A. Sullivan Palincsar.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = von Glasersfeld | first1 = Ernst | year = 1995 | title = Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning|location= London|publisher= Routledge }}; {{cite journal | last1=Palincsar|first1= A.S. |year=1998|title= Social constructivist perspectives on teaching and learning | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.345 |pmid= 15012472 | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | pages = 345–375 }}</ref>

===Systemic therapy===
Some of the systemic models that use social constructionism include  [[Narrative therapy|Narrative Therapy]] and [[Solution-focused brief therapy|Solution Focused Therapy]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=APA PsycNet|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-59956-008|access-date=2021-05-10|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en}}</ref>

=== Crime ===

[[United States incarceration rate#Editorial policies of major media|Potter and Kappeler (1996)]], in their introduction to ''Constructing Crime: Perspective on Making News And Social Problems'' wrote, "Public opinion and crime facts demonstrate no congruence.  The reality of crime in the United States has been subverted to a constructed reality as ephemeral as swamp gas."<ref>{{cite Q|Q96343487}}<!-- Potter & Kappeler (1996) Constructing Crime -->, p. 2.</ref>

Criminology has long focussed on why and how society defines criminal behavior and crime in general. While looking at crime through a social constructionism lens, we see evidence to support that criminal acts are a social construct where abnormal or deviant acts become a crime based on the views of society.<ref name=lindgren-et.al>{{cite journal |last1=Lindgren |first1=Sven‐Åke |title=Social Constructionism and Criminology: Traditions, Problems and Possibilities |journal=Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention |date=June 2005 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=4–22 |doi=10.1080/14043850510035119 |s2cid=144925991 }}</ref> Another explanation of crime as it relates to social constructionism are individual identity constructs that result in deviant behavior.<ref name="lindgren-et.al" /> If someone has constructed the identity of a "madman" or "criminal" for themselves based on a society's definition, it may force them to follow that label, resulting in criminal behavior.<ref name="lindgren-et.al" />

===Communication studies===

A bibliographic review of social constructionism as used within [[communication studies]] was published in 2016. It features a good overview of resources from that disciplinary perspective<ref>{{cite book |last=Leeds-Hurwitz |first=Wendy |editor-last=Moy |editor-first=Patricia |title=Oxford bibliographies in communication |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2016 |chapter=Social construction}}</ref> The collection of essays published in Galanes and Leeds-Hurwitz (2009) should also be useful to anyone interested in how social construction actually works during communication.<ref name="Galanes & Leeds-Hurwitz">{{cite book |last1=Galanes |first1=Gloria J. |last2=Leeds-Hurwitz |first2=Wendy |title=Socially constructing communication |date=2009 |publisher=Hampton Press |location=Cresskill, NJ}}</ref> This collection was the result of a conference held in 2006, sponsored by the [[National Communication Association]] as a Summer institute, entitled "Catching ourselves in the Act: A Collaboration to Enrich our Discipline Through Social Constructionist Approaches."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spano |first1=Shawn |last2=Foss |first2=Karen A. |last3=Kirschbaum |first3=Kris |editor-last1=Galanes |editor-first1=Gloria J. |editor-last2= Leeds-Hurwitz |editor-first2=Wendy |title=Socially constructing communication |publisher=Hampton Press |location=Cresskill, NJ |date=2009 |chapter=Creating opportunities for social construction: The Albuquerque NCA Summer Institute |pages=13–31}}</ref> Briefly, the basic assumption of the group was that "individuals jointly construct (create) their understandings of the world and the meanings they give to encounters with others, or various products others create. At the heart of the matter is the assumption that such meanings are constructed ''jointly'', that is, in coordination with others, rather than individually. Thus the term of choice most often is ''social'' construction."<ref name="auto">{{cite book |last1=Galanes |first1=Gloria J. |last2=Leeds-Hurwitz |first2=Wendy |editor-last1=Galanes |editor-first1=Gloria J. |editor-last2= Leeds-Hurwitz |editor-first2=Wendy |title=Socially constructing communication |publisher=Hampton Press |location=Cresskill, NJ |date=2009 |chapter=Communication as social construction: Catching ourselves in the act |pages=1–9}}</ref> At that event, John Stewart in his keynote presentation, suggested it was time to choose a single term among the set then common (social constructionist, social constructivism, social constructivist), and proposed using the simpler form: ''social construction''. Those present at the conference agreed to that use, and so that is the term most often used in this book, and by communication scholars since then.<ref name="auto"/> During discussion at the conference, participants developed a common list of principles: 
*1. Communication is the process through which we construct and reconstruct social worlds.
*2. Communication is constitutive; communication makes things.
*3. Every action is consequential.
*4. We make things together. We construct the social worlds we share with others as relational beings.
*5. We perceive many social worlds existing simultaneously, and we continue to shape them. Other people's social worlds may be different from ours. What we inherit is not our identity.
*6. No behavior conveys meaning in and of itself. Contexts afford and constrain meanings.
*7. Ethical implications and consequences derive from Principles 1-6.<ref name="auto"/>

A survey of publications in communication relating to social construction in 2009 found that the major topics covered were: identity, language, narratives, organizations, conflict, and media.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leeds-Hurwitz |first=Wendy |editor-last1=Galanes |editor-first1=Gloria J. |editor-last2= Leeds-Hurwitz |editor-first2=Wendy |title=Socially constructing communication |publisher=Hampton Press |location=Cresskill, NJ |date=2009 |chapter=Social construction: Moving from theory to research (and back again) |pages=99–134}}</ref>

== History and development ==
===Berger and Luckmann===
{{refimprove section|find=social construction|find2=Berger and Luckmann|reason=Unsourced since 2005|talk=Berger and Luckmann Section|date=October 2021}}

Constructionism became prominent in the U.S. with [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]]'s 1966 book, ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Knoblauch|first1=Hubert|last2=Wilke|first2=René|date=2016|title=The Common Denominator: The Reception and Impact of Berger and Luckmann's The Social Construction of Reality|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10746-016-9387-3|journal=Human Studies|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1007/s10746-016-9387-3|s2cid=146905539|issn=0163-8548|quote="Although the phrase ‘‘social construction’’ had been used by Ward as early as 1905, we will try to show here that the concept only took off after the publication of Berger and Luckmann’s book, particularly after the publication of an inexpensive paperback edition in 1967"}}</ref> Berger and Luckmann argue that all knowledge, including the most basic, taken-for-granted [[common sense]] knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by [[social interactions]].<ref>{{harvnb|Knoblauch|2016}}: "Berger and Luckmann stressed the role of typification and other constitutional processes like meaning and knowledge only, as they state explicitly — a difference which has hardly been addressed in the literature — because it is ‘‘knowledge that guides conduct in everyday life’’ (1966: 33). The social construction, Berger and Luckmann stress, is accomplished not by meaning, typification, or consciousness; social reality is, rather, constructed by processes which are specifically social, such as social actions, social interactions, and institutions."}}</ref> In their model, people interact on the understanding that their perceptions of everyday life are shared with others, and this common knowledge of reality is in turn reinforced by these interations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Czepczynski|first=Mariusz|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1018167337|title=Cultural Landscapes of Post-Socialist Cities : Representation of Powers and Needs.|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-1-317-15640-6|location=London|pages=34|oclc=1018167337}}</ref> Since this common sense knowledge is negotiated by people, human [[typification]]s, [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]ifications and [[social institution|institution]]s come to be presented as part of an objective reality, particularly for future generations who were not involved in the original process of negotiation. For example, as parents negotiate rules for their children to follow, those rules confront the children as externally produced "givens" that they cannot change. Berger and Luckmann's social constructionism has its roots in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. It links to [[Heidegger]] and [[Edmund Husserl]] through the teaching of [[Alfred Schutz]], who was also Berger's PhD adviser.

===Narrative turn===
During the 1970s and 1980s, social constructionist theory underwent a transformation as constructionist sociologists engaged with the work of [[Michel Foucault]] and others as a narrative turn in the social sciences was worked out in practice. This particularly affected the emergent [[sociology of science]] and the growing field of [[science and technology studies]]. In particular, [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[Steve Woolgar]], and others used social constructionism to relate what science has typically characterized as objective facts to the processes of social construction, with the goal of showing that human [[subjectivity]] imposes itself on those facts we take to be objective, not solely the other way around. A particularly provocative title in this line of thought is [[Andrew Pickering]]'s ''Constructing Quarks: A Sociological History of Particle Physics''. At the same time, social constructionism shaped studies of technology – the Sofield, especially on the [[social construction of technology]], or SCOT, and authors as [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], Maarten van Wesel, etc.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pinch |first1=T.

Sociologists such as [[Sal Restivo]] and [[Randall Collins]], mathematicians including [[Reuben Hersh]] and [[Philip J. Davis]], and philosophers including [[Paul Ernest]] have published social constructionist treatments of mathematics.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

===Postmodernism===
Within the social constructionist strand of postmodernism, the concept of socially constructed reality stresses the ongoing mass-building of [[worldview]]s by [[individual]]s in [[dialectic]]al interaction with society at a time. The numerous [[reality|realities]] so formed comprise, according to this view, the [[Imagined communities|imagined worlds]] of human social existence and activity, gradually crystallized by [[habituation|habit]] into institutions propped up by [[language]] conventions, given ongoing legitimacy by [[mythology]], religion and philosophy, maintained by therapies and [[socialization]], and subjectively [[internalisation (sociology)|internalized]] by upbringing and education to become part of the [[identity (social science)|identity]] of social citizens.

In the book ''The Reality of Social Construction'', the British sociologist Dave Elder-Vass places the development of social constructionism as one outcome of the legacy of postmodernism. He writes "Perhaps the most widespread and influential product of this process [coming to terms with the legacy of postmodernism] is social constructionism, which has been booming [within the domain of social theory] since the 1980s."<ref name="autogenerated1">Dave Elder-Vass. 2012.''The Reality of Social Construction''.

== Criticisms ==
The stronger criticism that can be levelled at social constructionism is that it generally ignores the contribution made by physical and biological sciences or misuses them in social sciences.<ref name="Sokal">{{Cite book |author=Sokal, A., & Bricmont, J. |year=1999 |title=Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science |location=New York |publisher=Picador |isbn=978-0-312-20407-5 }}</ref> Most notably, social constructionists assume society as both a descriptive and normative term, thereby failing to provide adequate explanation as to what they mean by society, whether it be an ideological concept or a description of any historically located community.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Physiology of the Soul|url=http://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503581613-1|access-date=2021-05-06|website=www.brepols.net}}</ref>

As a theory, social constructionism rejects the influences of biology on behaviour and culture, or suggests that they are unimportant to achieve an understanding of human behaviour,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brickell|first=Chris|date=2006-02-01|title=The Sociological Construction of Gender and Sexuality|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2006.00603.x|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=54|issue=1|pages=87–113|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954X.2006.00603.x|s2cid=23558016|issn=0038-0261}}</ref> while the scientific consensus is that behaviour is a complex outcome of both biological and cultural influences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beyond Nature vs. Nurture |url=https://www.the-scientist.com/reading-frames/beyond-nature-vs-nurture-41858 |website=The Scientist Magazine }}</ref><ref>Ridly, M. (2004). The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture. NY: Harper.{{page needed|date=August 2020}}</ref> Social constructionism has been criticized for having an overly narrow focus on society and culture as a causal factor in human behavior, excluding the influence of innate biological tendencies, by psychologists such as [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rJ5gI1LbXoC&q=social%20constructionism&pg=PA40|title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature|date=2016|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9781101200322|pages=40}}</ref> as well as by Asian Studies scholar Edward Slingerland in ''What Science Offers the Humanities''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Slingerland|first=Edward|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRPAoofyfDsC|title=What Science Offers the Humanities|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139470360}}{{page needed|date=August 2020}}</ref> [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] used the term "[[standard social science model]]" to refer to [[social theory|social theories]] that they believe fail to take into account the evolved properties of the brain.<ref>Barkow, J., Cosmides, L. & Tooby, J. 1992.

Social constructionism equally denies or downplays to a significant extent the role that meaning and language have for each individual, seeking to configure language as an overall structure rather than a historical instrument used by individuals to communicate their personal experiences of the world. This is particularly the case with cultural studies, where personal and pre-linguistic experiences are disregarded as irrelevant or seen as completely situated and constructed by the socio-economical superstructure.

In 1996, to illustrate what he believed to be the intellectual weaknesses of social constructionism and postmodernism, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] submitted an article to the academic journal ''[[Social Text]]'' deliberately written to be incomprehensible but including phrases and jargon typical of the articles published by the journal. [[Sokal affair|The submission]], which was published, was an experiment to see if the journal would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html |title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies |access-date=3 April 2007 |last=Sokal |first=Alan D. |author-link=Alan Sokal |work=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]] |date=May 1996}}</ref><ref name="Sokal"/> In 1999, Sokal, with coauthor Jean Bricmont published the book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'', which criticized [[postmodernism]] and social constructionism.

Philosopher [[Paul Boghossian]] has also written against social constructionism. He follows Ian Hacking's argument that many adopt social constructionism because of its potentially liberating stance: if things are the way that they are only because of our social conventions, as opposed to being so naturally, then it should be possible to change them into how we would rather have them be. He then states that social constructionists argue that we should refrain from making absolute judgements about what is true and instead state that something is true in the light of this or that theory. Countering this, he states:

{{quote|But it is hard to see how we might coherently follow this advice. Given that the propositions which make up epistemic systems are just very general propositions about what absolutely justifies what, it makes no sense to insist that we abandon making absolute ''particular'' judgements about what justifies what while allowing us to ''accept'' absolute ''general'' judgements about what justifies what. But in effect this is what the epistemic relativist is recommending.<ref>Paul Boghossian, ''Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Constructivism'', Oxford University Press, 2006, 152pp, hb/pb, {{ISBN|0-19-928718-X}}.{{page needed|date=August 2020}}</ref>}}
