==Biography==
Reisman was born in [[New York City]]<ref name="cao" /> and graduated from Columbia College in 1957.<ref name=":0" /> He earned his [[PhD]] from [[New York University]] under the direction of [[Ludwig von Mises]], whose methodological work ''The Epistemological Problems of Economics'' Reisman translated from the German original to English.

In the 1980s, with his wife, psychologist Edith Packer, he organized the Jefferson School of Philosophy, Economics, and Psychology, which held several conferences and seminars, the first being held at [[University of California, San Diego]]. Its lecturers included [[Leonard Peikoff]], [[Edward Teller]], [[Petr Beckmann]], [[Hans Sennholz]], [[Bernard Siegan]], Anne Wortham, [[Robert Hessen]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[David Kelley]], [[John Ridpath]], [[Harry Binswanger]], [[Edwin Locke]], [[Walter E. Williams]], Mary Ann Sures, [[Andrew Bernstein]] and [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]]. Attendees of these conferences include later Objectivist writers [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]] and [[Lindsay Perigo]].<ref>[http://www.capitalism.net/TJS%20Mission%20Statement.htm The Thomas Jefferson School of Philosophy, Economics and Psychology]</ref>

Reisman was a student of [[Ayn Rand]], whose influence on his thought and work is at least as great as that of his mentor, Mises.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2021-02-05|title=George Reisman on Ludwig von Mises, Ayn Rand, and Capitalism|url=https://theobjectivestandard.com/2021/02/george-reisman-on-ludwig-von-mises-ayn-rand-and-capitalism/|access-date=2021-02-22|website=The Objective Standard|language=en-US}}</ref> He identifies himself as an [[Objectivism|Objectivist]], but he is no longer affiliated with the [[Ayn Rand Institute]] because of a falling out with some of its senior members.
