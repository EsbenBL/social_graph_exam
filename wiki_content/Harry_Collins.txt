'''Harry Collins''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (born 13 June 1943),<ref name=Congress>{{cite web |title= Collins, H. M. (Harry M.), 1943- |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81099696.html |publisher= Library of Congress |access-date= 15 February 2015 |quote= data sheet (b. 6/13/43) }}</ref> is a British [[sociology|sociologist]] of science<!--SSK, linked below--> at the School of Social Sciences, [[Cardiff University]], Wales. In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].

== Career ==
While at the [[University of Bath]] Professor Collins developed the Bath School approach to the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].

In ''Changing Order: Replication and Induction in Scientific Practice'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Collins | first = Harry M. | title = Changing order: replication and induction in scientific practice | url = https://archive.org/details/changingorderrep0000coll | url-access = registration | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Beverly Hills | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780803997172 }}</ref> Collins outlines a general theory of [[sociology of science]]. Drawing from the concepts of "Language Game" and "Forms of Life", derived from the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], he seeks an explanation for how scientists follow rules and patterns when performing experiments and scientific practice. Collins' perspective is usually called a [[relativist]] position, although this is a strong [[oversimplification]].

Collins has written for over 30 years on the sociology of [[gravitational wave]] physics.  His publications in this area include: "The Seven Sexes: Study in Sociology of a Phenomenon, or Replication of Experiments in Physics" "Son of Seven Sexes: The Social Destruction of a Physical Phenomenon".<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Collins | first = Harry M. | title = The seven sexes: a study in the sociology of a phenomenon, or the replication of experiments in physics | journal = [[Sociology (journal)|Sociology]] | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–224 | doi = 10.1177/003803857500900202 | date = May 1975 }}</ref>  He has traced the search for gravitational waves, and has shown how scientific data can be subject to interpretative flexibility, and how social or 'non-scientific' means can be sometimes used to close [[scientific controversy|scientific controversies]].

In an article in ''Science as Practice and Culture'', Collins and his co-writer [[Steven Yearley]] argue that the [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) approach is a step backwards towards the [[positivist]] and [[Scientific realism|realist]] positions held by early theory of science.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Collins | first1 = Harry M. | last2 = Yearley | first2 = Steven | author-link2 = Steven Yearley | contribution = Epistemological chicken | editor-last = Pickering | editor-first = Andrew | editor-link = Andrew Pickering | title = Science as practice and culture | pages = 301–327 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780226668017 | postscript = .}}</ref>

At the beginning of the two thousands, Collins along with Dr Robert Evans, also of Cardiff University, has published works on what they term the "Third Wave of Science Studies" and, in particular, the idea of [[interactional expertise]].  This aims to address questions of legitimacy and extension and public involvement in scientific decision-making. They continue to research and publish on this topic.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = Harry M. | last2 = Evans | first2 = Robert  | title = The third wave of science studies: studies of expertise and experience | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 235–296 | doi = 10.1177/0306312702032002003 | date = April 2002 }}</ref>
