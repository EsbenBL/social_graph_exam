"SHERRY ORTNER is a respected anthropologist who has turned her attention away from Sherpas in Nepal to the Class of '58 Weequahic high school in Newark, New Jersey, the high school from which she herself graduated that year."</ref> She received her B.A. from [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1962. She then studied anthropology at the [[University of Chicago]] with [[Clifford Geertz]] and obtained her Ph.D. in anthropology in 1970 for her fieldwork among the [[Sherpas]] in [[Nepal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anthro.ucla.edu/faculty/sherry-b-ortner|title=UCLA Anthropology|website=www.anthro.ucla.edu|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>  She has taught at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. She has done extensive fieldwork with the Sherpas of Nepal, on religion, politics, and the Sherpas' involvement in Himalayan mountaineering.  Her final book on the Sherpas, ''Life and Death on Mt. Everest'', was awarded the J.I. Staley prize for the best anthropology book of 2004.

In the early 1990s, Ortner changed the focus of her research to the United States.  Her first project was on the meanings and working of "class" in the United States, using her own high school graduating class as her ethnographic subjects.  Her most recent book concerns the relationship between Hollywood films and American culture.  She also publishes regularly in the areas of cultural theory and feminist theory.

Sherry Ortner was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur "Genius" grant]] in 1990.<ref>Beale, lewis.

She is currently married to Timothy D. Taylor, a Professor of Ethnomusicology and Musicology at [[UCLA]].

==Theoretical foundations==
Ortner is a well-known proponent of [[practice theory]]. She does not focus on societal reproduction but centers on the idea of "serious games", on resistance and transformation within a society. She formed her ideas while working with [[Sherpas]].  She is concerned with the dominant constraints of cultural understanding within cultures, subversive to the idea of culture as being simply reproduced. Actors play with skill in a game of life with power and inequality.  Seeing social structure as a kind of sporting arena, playing a game of life in the field, and that the rules are set by the society's structure. But one is a free agent, one does not have to follow the rules. One can break the rules of life. This results in one being carried away or results in changing the rules and boundaries by this action. Ortner focuses on the issues of resistance and transformation.
