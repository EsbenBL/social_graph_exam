'''Anna Julia Haywood Cooper''' (August 10, 1858{{spnd}}February 27, 1964) was an American author, educator, sociologist, speaker, Black liberation activist, and one of the most prominent [[African Americans|African-American]] scholars in United States history.

Born into slavery in 1858, Cooper went on to receive a world-class education and claim power and prestige in academic and social circles.<ref name="www2.oberlin.edu">{{Cite web|url=http://www2.oberlin.edu/external/EOG/History322/AnnaJuliaCooper/AnnaJuliaCooper.htm|title="This Scholarly and Colored Alumna": Transcriptions of Anna Julia Cooper's Correspondence with Oberlin College|website=www2.oberlin.edu|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> In 1924,  she received her PhD in history from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], University of Paris.<ref name=":1" /> Cooper became the fourth African-American woman to earn a doctoral degree.{{efn|After [[Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander]] (Economics, University of Pennsylvania, 1921), [[Georgiana Simpson]] (German, University of Chicago, 1921), and [[Eva Beatrice Dykes]] (Literature, Radcliffe College, 1921)}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Portable Nineteenth-Century African American Women Writers|publisher=Penguin|year=2017|isbn=9780143105992|editor-last=Robbins|editor-first=Hollis|editor-link=Hollis Robbins|location=New York|pages=414|oclc=951070652|editor-last2=Gates|editor-first2=Henry Louis, Jr.|editor-link2=Henry Louis Gates Jr.}}</ref> She was also a prominent member of Washington, D.C.'s African-American community and a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority.

Cooper made contributions to social science fields, particularly in sociology.

==Biography==
[[File:Anna Julia Cooper 1892.tif|thumb|Cooper in 1892]]

===Childhood ===
Anna "Annie" Julia Haywood was born enslaved in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], in 1858. She and her mother, Hannah Stanley Haywood, were held in bondage by George Washington Haywood (1802–1890), one of the sons of North Carolina's longest serving state Treasurer [[John Haywood (politician)|John Haywood]], who helped found the [[University of North Carolina]], but whose estate later was forced to repay missing funds. Either George, in whose household her mother worked in bondage, or his brother, Dr. Fabius Haywood, in whose household her older brother Andrew was enslaved,<ref>{{Cite web

Cooper worked as a domestic servant in the Haywood home and had two older brothers, Andrew J. Haywood and Rufus Haywood.<ref name=Giles>{{cite journal|last=Giles|first=Mark S.|title=Special Focus: Dr. Anna Julia Cooper, 1858–1964: Teacher, Scholar, and Timeless Womanist|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|date=Fall 2006|volume=75|issue=4|pages=621–634 |jstor=40034662}}</ref> Andrew, enslaved by Fabius J.

===Education===

In 1868, when Cooper was nine years old, she received a scholarship and began her education at the newly opened [[St. Augustine's University|Saint Augustine's Normal School and Collegiate Institute]] in Raleigh, founded by [[Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina|the local Episcopal diocese]] for the purpose of training teachers to educate the formerly enslaved and their families. The Reverend J. Brinton offered Cooper a scholarship to help pay for her expenses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Woman of Courage: The Story of Anna J. Cooper|last=Martin-Felton|author-link=Zora Martin-Felton|first=Zora|publisher=Education Department, Anacostia Neighborhood Museum of the Smithsonian Institution|year=2000|location=Washington|pages=14|oclc=53457649}}</ref> According to Mark S. Giles, a Cooper biographer, "the educational levels offered at St. Augustine ranged from primary to high school, including trade-skill training."<ref name="Giles" /> During her 14 years at St. Augustine's, she distinguished herself as a bright and ambitious student who showed equal promise in both liberal arts and analytical disciplines such as mathematics and science; her subjects included languages (Latin, French, Greek), English literature, math, and science. Although the school had a special track reserved for women – dubbed the "Ladies' Course" – and the administration actively discouraged women from pursuing higher-level courses, Cooper fought for her right to take a course reserved for men, by demonstrating her scholastic ability.<ref name="Giles" /> During this period, St. Augustine's pedagogical emphasis was on training young men for the ministry and preparing them for additional training at four-year universities. One of these men, [[George A. C. Cooper]], would later become her husband. He died after only two years of marriage.<ref name="Giles" />

Cooper's academic excellence enabled her to work as a tutor for younger children, which also helped her pay for her educational expenses. After completing her studies, she remained at the institution as an instructor. In the 1883–1884 school year, she taught classics, modern history, higher English, and vocal and instrumental music; she is not listed as faculty in the 1884–1885 year, but in the 1885–1886 year she is listed as "Instructor in Classic, Rhetoric, Etc."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofstaug18821899|title=Catalogue of St. Augustine's Normal School, 1882–99|date=1899|website=Internet Archive|access-date=March 23, 2016|publisher=Raleigh (N.C.): St. Augustine's Normal School and Collegiate Institute}}</ref> Her husband's early death may have contributed to her ability to continue teaching; if she had stayed married, she might have been encouraged or required to withdraw from the university to become a housewife.<ref name=Giles />

After her husband's death, Cooper entered [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio, where she continued to follow the course of study designated for men, graduating in 1884.<ref name=Dyson>{{cite news

E. B. Du Bois]]' similar arguments in "Of the Training of Black Men" (''Souls of Black Folk'' 1903) by almost a decade.<ref name=":1" />{{rp|144}} 

In 1900 she made her first trip to Europe, to participate in the [[First Pan-African Conference]] in London. After visiting the cathedral towns of Scotland and England, she went to Paris for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|World Exposition]]. "After a week at the Exposition she went to [[Oberammergau]] to see the Passion Play, thence to Munich and other German towns, and then to Italy through Rome, Naples, Venice, Pompeii, Mt. Vesuvius, and Florence."<ref name=Dyson/> 

===Washington DC years ===
She later moved to Washington, DC. In 1892, Anna Cooper, [[Helen Appo Cook]], [[Ida B. Wells]], [[Charlotte Forten Grimké]], Mary Jane Peterson, [[Mary Church Terrell]], and Evelyn Shaw formed the [[Colored Women's League]] in Washington, D.C. The goals of the service-oriented club were to promote unity, social progress and the best interests of the African-American community. Helen Cook was elected president.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Jessie Carney |title=Notable Black American women. |date=1992 |publisher=Gale Research Inc. |page=123 |edition=v1 |language=en |chapter=Josephine Beall Bruce|oclc=34106990 }}</ref>

Cooper would develop a close friendship with [[Charlotte Forten Grimké]] – Cooper began teaching Latin at [[M Street High School]], becoming principal in 1901.<ref name=Busby>[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], "Anna J. Cooper", ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', London: Jonathan Cape, 1992, p. 136.</ref> She later became entangled in a controversy involving the differing attitudes about black education, as she advocated for a model of classical education espoused by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], "designed to prepare eligible students for higher education and leadership", rather than the vocational program that was promoted by [[Booker T. Washington]].<ref name=":0" /> As a result of this, she left the school. Later, she was recalled to M Street, and she fit her work on her doctoral thesis into "nooks and crannies of free time".<ref name=":0" />  
[[File:M Street High School.jpg|thumb|M Street School]]

===''A Voice from the South''===

During her years as a teacher and principal at M Street High School, Cooper also completed her first book, titled ''[[A Voice from the South]]: By a Black Woman of the South'', published in 1892, and delivered many speeches calling for civil rights and women's rights.<ref name="Washington">{{cite book|last=Washington|first=Mary Helen|title=A Voice from the South: Introduction|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-506323-3|pages=xxvii–liv}}</ref> Perhaps her most well-known volume of writing, ''A Voice from the South,'' is widely viewed as one of the first articulations of black feminism.<ref name="Busby" /> The book advanced a vision of self-determination through education and social uplift for African-American women. Its central thesis was that the educational, moral, and spiritual progress of black women would improve the general standing of the entire African-American community. She says that the violent natures of men often run counter to the goals of higher education, so it is important to foster more female intellectuals because they will bring more elegance to education.<ref name="Ritchie">{{cite book|last=Ritchie|first=Joy|title=Available Means: An Anthology of Women's Rhetoric(s)|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=978-0-8229-5753-9|pages=163–164|author2=Kate Ronald}}</ref> This view was criticized by some as submissive to the 19th-century [[Cult of Domesticity|cult of true womanhood]], but others label it as one of the most important arguments for black feminism in the 19th century.<ref name="Ritchie" /> Cooper advanced the view that it was the duty of educated and successful black women to support their underprivileged peers in achieving their goals. The essays in ''A Voice from the South'' also touched on a variety of topics, such as race and [[Racism in the United States|racism]], gender, the socioeconomic realities of black families, and the administration of the Episcopal Church.

==== Reception ====
''A Voice from the South'' received significant praise from leaders in the black community.<ref>"Late Publications, Books, Magazines, Etc.." ''Freeman'', vol. 5, no. 9, March 4, 1893, p. [3].</ref><ref>"A Voice From The South By a Black Woman of the South--The Venerable and." ''[[The Cleveland Gazette]]'', May 6, 1893, p. 2.</ref>

===Later years===
[[File:Anna Julia Hayward Cooper House - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|Former home of Anna J. Cooper in the [[LeDroit Park, Washington, D.C.|LeDroit Park]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The home is located beside [[Anna J. Cooper Circle]].]]
Cooper was an author, educator, and public speaker. In 1893, she delivered a paper titled "The Intellectual Progress of the Colored Women of the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation" at the [[World's Congress of Representative Women]] in Chicago. She was one of five African-American women invited to speak at this event, along with: [[Fannie Barrier Williams]], [[Sarah Jane Woodson Early]], [[Hallie Quinn Brown]], and [[Fanny Jackson Coppin]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hairston|first1=Eric Ashley|title=The Ebony Column|date=2013|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=978-1-57233-984-2|page=121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sewall, ed.|first1=May Wright|title=The World's Congress of Representative Women|date=1894|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Chicago|pages=711–715|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/socm/doc4b.htm}}</ref>

Cooper was also present at the [[first Pan-African Conference]] in London, England, in 1900 and delivered a paper titled "The Negro Problem in America."<ref name=Washington /><ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SLAwilliamsS.htm Sylvester Williams, Spartacus Educational.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022091321/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SLAwilliamsS.htm |date=October 22, 2012 }}</ref>

In a 1902 speech she said:

{{Quote|text=A nation's greatness is not dependent upon the things it make and uses. Things without thots [ sic] are mere vulgarities. America can boast her expanse of territory, her gilded domes, her paving stones of silver dollars; but the question of deepest moment in this nation today is its men and its women, the elevation at which it receives its "vision" into the firmament of eternal truth.|sign=|source="The Ethics of the Negro Question", September 5, 1902<ref>{{citation |url=https://dh.howard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=ajc_addresses |title=The Ethics of the Negro Question |first=Anna Julia |last=Cooper |date=5 September 1902 |website=Digital Howard |publisher=Howard University}}.</ref>}}

In 1914, at the age of 56, Cooper began courses for her doctoral degree at Columbia University, but was forced to interrupt her studies in 1915 when she adopted her late half-brother's five children upon their mother's death. Later on she transferred her credits to the University of Paris-Sorbonne, which did not accept her Columbia thesis, an edition of ''[[Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne]]''. Over a decade she researched and composed her dissertation, completing her coursework in 1924. Cooper defended her thesis "The Attitude of France on the Question of Slavery Between 1789 and 1848" in 1925. Cooper’s retirement from Washington Colored High School in 1930 was by no means the end of her political activism. The same year she retired, she accepted the position of president at Frelinghuysen University, a school founded to provide classes for DC residents lacking access to higher education. Cooper worked for Frelinghuysen for twenty years, first as president and then as registrar, and left the school only a decade before her death in 1964 at the age of 105.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cooperproject.org/about-anna-julia-cooper/|title=Anna Julia Cooper's Bio - Anna Julia Cooper Project|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> At the age of 65, she became the fourth black woman in American history to earn a Doctor of Philosophy degree. Her work was eventually published in an anthology of medieval French literature, and was requested for classes and the bookstore at Harvard.<ref name="www2.oberlin.edu"/>

===Frelinghuysen University===
Cooper's later years were much involved with [[Frelinghuysen University]], of which she was the president. This was an institution providing continuing education to working African Americans at hours that did not interfere with their employment. After the University found servicing its mortgage prohibitive, she moved it to her own house.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decennial Catalogue of Frelinghuysen University|year=1939|first=Anna J.|last=Cooper|url=https://dh.howard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=ajc_freling|access-date=December 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Death===
On February 27, 1964, Cooper died in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the age of 105. Her memorial was held in a chapel on the campus of [[St. Augustine's University (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Saint Augustine's College]], in Raleigh, North Carolina, where her academic career began. She was buried alongside her husband at the [[City Cemetery (Raleigh, North Carolina)|City Cemetery]] in Raleigh.

===Writings===
Although the alumni magazine of Cooper's undergraduate alma mater, Oberlin College, praised her in 1924, stating, "The class of '84 is honored in the achievement of this scholarly and colored alumna," when she tried to present her edition of ''Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne'' to the college the next year, it was rejected.<ref>Shilton, Katherine, [http://www.oberlin.edu/external/EOG/History322/AnnaJuliaCooper/AnnaJuliaCooper.htm "'This Scholarly and Colored Alumna': Anna Julia Cooper's Troubled Relationship with Oberlin College"], Oberlin College, 2003.</ref>

Cooper's other writings include her autobiographical booklet ''The Third Step'', about earning her doctorate from the Sorbonne, and a memoir about the [[Grimké sisters|Grimké Family]], titled "The Early Years in Washington: Reminiscences of Life with the Grimkés,"<ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anna-julia-cooper/ "Anna Julia Cooper"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', March 31, 2015.</ref> which appeared in ''Personal Recollections of the Grimké family and the Life and Writings of Charlotte Forten Grimké'' (privately published in 1951).<ref>Lemert, Charles, and Esme Bhan (eds), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JfZsAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA306&lpg=PA306&dq=Anna+J.+Cooper+Personal+Recollections+of+the+Grimke+Family#v=onepage&q=Anna%20J.%20Cooper%20Personal%20Recollections%20of%20the%20Grimke%20Family ''The Voice of Anna Julia Cooper: Including a Voice from the South and Other Important Essays, Papers, and Letters''], Rowman and Littlefield, 1998, p. 306.</ref>
