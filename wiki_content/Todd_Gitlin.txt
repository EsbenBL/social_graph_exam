In his early writings on media, especially ''The Whole World Is Watching'', he called attention to the ideological framing of the [[New Left]] and other social movements, the vexed relations of leadership and celebrity, and the impact of coverage on the movements themselves. He was the first sociologist to apply [[Erving Goffman]]'s concept of "frame" to news analysis, and to show [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s "[[hegemony]]" at work in a detailed analysis of intellectual production. In ''Inside Prime Time'', he analyzes the workings of the television entertainment industry of the early 1980s, discerning the implicit procedures that guide network executives and other television "players" to make their decisions. In ''The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage'', a memoir and analysis combined, he develops a sense of the tensions between expressive and strategic politics. In ''The Twilight of Common Dreams'', he asks why the groups that constitute the American left so often turn to infighting, rather than solidarity. In ''Media Unlimited'', he turns to the unceasing flow of the media torrent, the problems of attention and distraction, and the emotional payoffs of media experience (which he called "disposable emotions") in our time. In ''Occupy Nation: The Roots, the Spirit, and the Promise of Occupy Wall Street'', he distinguishes between "inner" and "outer" movements and analyzes their respective strengths and weaknesses.

In ''The Whole World Is Watching: Mass Media in the Making and Unmaking of the New Left'', ''The Sixties'', The ''Twilight of Common Dreams: Why America Is Wracked with Culture Wars'', ''Letters to a Young Activist'', and ''The Intellectuals and the Flag'', Gitlin became a prominent critic of the tactics and rhetoric of both the left and the right. Supporting active, strategically-focused nonviolent movements, he emphasizes what he sees as the need in American politics to form coalitions between disparate movements, which must compromise ideological purity to gain and sustain power. During the [[George W. Bush administration]], he argued that the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] managed to accomplish that with a coalition of what he called two "major components—the low-tax, love-business, hate-government enthusiasts and the God-save-us moral crusaders" but that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] has often been unable to accomplish a pragmatic coalition between its "roughly eight" constituencies, which he identifies as "labor, African Americans, Hispanics, feminists, gays, environmentalists, members of the helping professions (teachers, social workers, nurses), and the militantly liberal, especially antiwar denizens of avant-garde cultural zones such as university towns, the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and so on." (from ''The Bulldozer and the Big Tent'', pp.&nbsp;18–19).

In the 2010 book ''The Chosen Peoples: America, Israel, and the Ordeals of Divine Election'', he and Liel Leibovitz traced parallel themes in the history of the Jews and the Americans through history down to the present.<ref>[http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Chosen-Peoples/Todd-Gitlin/9781439132364 "The Chosen Peoples"]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110202115731/http://thechosenpeoples.com/ "America, Israel and the Ordeals of Divine Election"].</ref>

=== Novelist ===
Gitlin has published three novels: ''The Murder of Albert Einstein'' (1992), ''Sacrifice'' (1999), and ''Undying'' (2011).<ref name="CenterAmericanStudies" /> ''Sacrifice'' won the Harold U. Ribalow Award for the best fiction on Jewish themes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Todd Gitlin |url=https://www.thecommongoodus.org/past-speakers/todd-gitlin |website=thecommongoodus.org |date=18 June 2012}}</ref> His novel ''The Opposition'' is forthcoming and it follows a group of 1960s activists through the decade.

== Quotes ==
{{quote|My generation of the [[New Left]] — a generation that grew as the [Vietnam] war went on — relinquished any title to patriotism without much sense of loss. All that was left to the Left was to unearth righteous traditions and cultivate them in universities. The much-mocked political correctness of the next academic generations was a consolation prize. We lost — we squandered the politics — but won the textbooks.|''Varieties of Patriotic Experience''}}
