'''Brandeis University''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|æ|n|d|aɪ|s}} is a [[Private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

[[Middlesex University (Massachusetts)|Middlesex University]] was a medical school located in Waltham, Massachusetts, that was at the time the only medical school in the United States that did not impose a [[Jewish quota|quota on Jews]]. The founder, Dr. John Hall Smith, died in 1944. Smith's will stipulated that the school should go to any group willing to use it to establish a non-sectarian university.<ref name= spirit>{{cite news |title= 'A School Of The Spirit' Graduates Its First |last= Gardner |first= R. H. |work= The Baltimore Sun |date= May 29, 1952 |page= 14 |id= {{ProQuest|541745484}} }}</ref> Within two years, Middlesex University was on the brink of financial collapse. The school had not been able to secure accreditation by the [[American Medical Association]], which Smith partially attributed to institutional antisemitism in the American Medical Association,<ref name=reisfounding>{{cite web |last = Reis |first= Arthur H., Jr. | title=The Founding |work= Brandeis Review, 50th Anniversary Edition | url= http://www.brandeis.edu/publications/review/50threview/founding.pdf | access-date= May 17, 2006 |pages= 42–43 |quote= Founder's son, C. Ruggles Smith, quoted: "From its inception, Middlesex was ruthlessly attacked by the American Medical Association, which at that time was dedicated to restricting the production of physicians, and to maintaining an inflexible policy of discrimination in the admission of medical students. Middlesex, alone among medical schools, selected its students on the basis of merit, and refused to establish any racial quotas. }}</ref> and, as a result, Massachusetts had all but shut it down.

Dr. Smith's son, C. Ruggles Smith, was desperate for a way to save something of Middlesex University. He learned of a New York committee headed by Dr. [[Israel Goldstein]] that was seeking a campus to establish a Jewish-sponsored secular university. Smith approached Goldstein with a proposal to give the Middlesex campus and charter to Goldstein's committee, in the hope that his committee might "possess the apparent ability to reestablish the School of Medicine on an approved basis." While Goldstein was concerned about being saddled with a failing medical school, he was excited about the opportunity to secure a {{convert|100|acre|ha|abbr=off|adj=on}} "campus not far from New York, the premier Jewish community in the world, and only {{convert|9|mi|km}} from Boston, one of the important Jewish population centers."<ref name="reisfounding"/> Goldstein agreed to accept Smith's offer, proceeding to recruit George Alpert, a Boston lawyer with fundraising experience as national vice president of the [[United Jewish Appeal]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Einstein also became alarmed by press announcements that exaggerated the school's success at fundraising.

Einstein threatened to sever ties with the foundation on September 2, 1946.

The Brandeis board felt it was in no position to make the investment in the medical school that would enable it to receive accreditation, and closed it in 1947. Einstein wanted Middlesex University's veterinary school's standards to be improved before expanding to the school,<ref name="einstein-quits" /> while others in the foundation wanted to simply close the veterinary school,<ref name="sachar" /> which, by the winter of 1947, had an enrollment of just about 100 students.<ref name="to-open" /> A professional study of the veterinary school recommended dismissing certain instructors and requiring end-of-year examinations for the students, but the foundation declined to enact any of the recommendations, to the dismay of Einstein and a couple of the foundation's trustees.<ref name="gives-up">{{cite news |title= Einstein Gives Up Support of New College |agency= Associated Press |newspaper= The Baltimore Sun |date= June 22, 1947 |page= A2 |id= {{ProQuest|542673850}} }}</ref>

Brandeis is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among [[List of research universities in the United States#Universities classified as "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"|"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=165015|title=Carnegie Classifications – Institution Profile|publisher=Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> In FY 2017, Brandeis spent $68.4 million on research and was ranked 174 in the nation by total R&D expenditure.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rankings by total R&D expenditures |url=https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site?method=rankingBySource&ds=herd |website=nsf.gov |publisher=National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics |access-date=18 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144205/https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site?method=rankingBySource&ds=herd |archive-date=13 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NSF – NCSES Academic Institution Profiles – Brandeis University : Total R&D expenditures, by source of funds and R&D field: 2017 |url=https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site?method=reportsall&fice=2133 |website=ncsesdata.nsf.gov |access-date=18 July 2020}}</ref> These include sponsored research funds from sources including the [[National Institutes of Health]]; the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] as well as a range of foundations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/ora/about/FY15ByFunder.html|title=- Brandeis University|website=www.brandeis.edu|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117121656/http://www.brandeis.edu/ora/about/FY15ByFunder.html|archive-date=2015-11-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The university's Division of Science encompasses seven departments (Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology), five interdepartmental programs (Biochemistry & Biophysics, Biological Physics, Biotechnology, Genetic Counseling, Molecular & Cell Biology, and Neuroscience), six science centers (Ashton Graybiel Spatial Orientation Laboratory, National Center for Behavioral Genomics, Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neurobiology, Benjamin and Mae Volen National Center for Complex Systems, and W.M. Keck Institute for Cellular Visualization), and more than 50 laboratories<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/research/index.html|title=Life Sciences Website|website=www.bio.brandeis.edu}}</ref> that investigate fundamental life processes ranging from the structure and function of individual macromolecules to the mechanisms that control the behavior of whole organisms.

Faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates investigate areas such as neuronal development and plasticity, signal transduction, immunology, the molecular basis of genetic recombination, and the three-dimensional structure of macromolecular assemblies. Brandeis science faculty include 12 National Academy of Science members,<ref>National Academy Members, http://www.brandeis.edu/about/faculty/national.html</ref> three Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators,<ref name="hhmi inv">Howard Hughes Medical

Brandeis undergraduate students have the opportunity to work with faculty, postdoctoral students and graduate students to conduct
original laboratory research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/research/students.html|title=Student Research|website=www.brandeis.edu}}</ref> Brandeis also offers a number of funding resources to support independent undergraduate research projects. In 2008, Brandeis established a Science Posse program, a merit-based scholarship program that admits students based on their academic, leadership and communication skills, and their interests in studying science. Founded by Irving Epstein, the Henry F. Fischbach Professor of Chemistry, and supported by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant, the Science Posse program is focused on increasing the recruitment and retention of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences. The program recruits, trains, and provides mentoring and other services for 10 inner-city Atlanta students each year who are interested in studying science at the undergraduate level.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20140915181351/https://www.hhmi.org/research/broadening-access-science-science-posse Broadening Access to Science: Science Posse]". ''Howard Hughes Medical Institute''. May 2014. Archived from [https://www.hhmi.org/research/broadening-access-science-science-posse the original] on September 15, 2014.</ref>

In 2014, the National Science Foundation renewed funding for Brandeis' Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), which was established in 2008. This center supports interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary materials research and education that address fundamental problems in science and engineering that are important to society.<ref>"[https://www.mrsec.org/mrsec-program-overview MRSEC Program Overview]". ''Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers''.</ref> In particular, the center uses simplified components to create new materials that have some of the functionalities found in living organisms.

The university has an active student government, the Brandeis Student Union,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://union.brandeis.edu/|title = Brandeis University Student Union|publisher = union.brandeis.edu|access-date = 2014-04-16|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140417004657/http://union.brandeis.edu/|archive-date = 2014-04-17|url-status = dead}}</ref> as well as more than 270 student organizations.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://my.brandeis.edu/clubs/| title=Club Center| publisher=My Brandeis| access-date=26 April 2009}}</ref> [[Fraternities and sororities]] aren't officially recognized by Brandeis University, as they are contrary to a central tenet of the university, namely, that student organizations be open to all students, with membership determined by competency or interest. According to an official handbook, "[e]xclusive or secret societies are inconsistent with the principles of openness to which the University is committed.".<ref>{{cite web |title=2007–2008 Rights & Responsibilities Handbook, Appendix B: University Policy on Fraternities and Sororities |publisher=Brandeis University |access-date=2008-03-17 |url=http://www.brandeis.edu/studentlife/sdc/rr/html/rr_appendix.html}}</ref>

Brandeis has 11 [[collegiate a cappella|a cappella]] groups, six undergraduate-run theater companies, one sketch comedy troupe (Boris' Kitchen, founded in 1987),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://borissketchcomedy.com|title=Boris' Kitchen|website=Boris' Kitchen}}</ref> four [[Improvisational theatre|improv-comedy]] groups, and many other cultural and arts clubs, as well as student activism groups that advocate for causes including environmentalism, immigration reform, LGBTQ rights, feminism, and anti-racism. Brandeis is also home to what has been cited as one of the country's few undergraduate-run law publications.<ref>{{cite web |title=Q&A with ALDF Staff Attorney about Pursuing a Career in Animal Law |publisher=Animal Legal Defense Fund |access-date=2011-01-07 |url=http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=1441 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119133337/http://aldf.org/article.php?id=1441 |archive-date=2010-11-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Of particular note is the Brandeis Academic Debate and Speech Society (B.A.D.A.S.S.), which consistently ranks as one of the top 10 debate teams in the United States, and participates across the globe in the [[World Universities Debating Championships]] each year.

Cholmondeley's coffeehouse, commonly referred to as "Chums", is located in Brandeis' [[Usen Castle]]. Chums is a popular site for student performances and concerts, including [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Matt Pond PA]], and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] (notable as their first American performance). Early footage of Chums appears in the short documentary film, ''Coffee House Rendezvous''.<ref>{{cite video |last=Steeg |first=Ted |title=Coffee House Rendezvous |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2NoKCg702g |publisher=Coffee Information Service |year=1969 |time=5:10}}</ref> Cholmondley's is named after a notoriously ill-tempered Basset hound that was the on-campus pet for Ralph Norman, the campus photographer during the first years of Brandeis. The dog roamed the campus after dark, growling at students, often nipping at their cuffs and making a general nuisance of himself. After his death, the coffee house was named for him, not so much in remembrance but in celebration.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2007/10/18/threes_a_charm/| title=Oppenheimer at Brandeis| date=18 October 2007| publisher=Globe Newspaper Company| access-date=26 April 2009 | first1=Catherine | last1=Elcik}}</ref> In 2015, in an email to student workers of the coffee house, Brandeis administration announced the immediate closure of Chums Coffeehouse, leaving said student workers unemployed. After significant pushback from the student body and alumni alike, the administration determined to make the closure temporary while the space underwent renovations.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://brandeishoot.com/2015/03/20/student-coffeehouse-undergoes-sudden-reorganization/ |title=Student coffeehouse undergoes sudden reorganization |work=brandeishoot.com |author=Charlotte Aaron |date=March 20, 2015}}</ref>

It was established in 1958 by [[Lawrence Wien|Lawrence A.]] and Mae Wien. The family had three objectives: to further international understanding, to provide foreign students an opportunity to study in the United States, and to enrich the intellectual and cultural life at Brandeis. The Wien Scholarship offers full or partial tuition awards; these awards are need-based and require the applicants to present outstanding academic and personal achievement. Each year, the recipients of the scholarship take a week-long tour of a destination in the United States. In previous years, the students have visited the United Nations in New York City, and did relief work in New Orleans following [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In April 2008, the university hosted a three-day-long celebration for the 50th anniversary of the program.
