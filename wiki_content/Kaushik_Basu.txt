==Early life and education==
Kaushik Basu was born in [[Kolkata]], India, where he attended [[St.&nbsp;Xavier's Collegiate School]]. In an autobiographical essay he noted that finishing school in 1969 he was caught in a dilemma. His father wanted him to study [[physics]]. But those were revolutionary times and he wanted to study nothing. They settled on economics as half-way compromise between physics and nothing.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1969 he moved to Delhi to do his undergraduate studies in Economics, from [[St.&nbsp;Stephen's College, Delhi|St. Stephen's College]], [[Delhi]]. He then attended [[London School of Economics]] and was awarded MSc in economics from [[University of London]] in 1974. After earning his master's degree, Basu was supposed to move to England to study law and take over his father's legal practice, but he had fallen in love with the concept of logic and deductive reasoning and became fascinated by [[Amartya Sen]]'s work.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rasheeda Bhagat |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/features/life/article2697841.ece |title=Business Line : Features / Life : Kaushik gets candid |publisher=Thehindubusinessline.com |access-date=26 March 2012}}</ref> He remained at the London School of Economics, University of London for his PhD, from 1974 to 1976.<ref>{{cite web|author=Business Standard |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/kaushik-basu-tipped-for-ceas-post/370350/ |title=Kaushik Basu tipped for CEA's post |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=17 September 2009 |access-date=26 March 2012}}</ref> He completed his PhD at University of London under the tutelage of Amartya Sen.
He has received honorary doctorates from [[Lucknow University]], Lucknow, in 2011, [[Assam University]], Silchar, in 2012, [[Fordham University]], New York, in 2013, [[Indian Institute of Technology Bombay]], in 2013, University of Bath, U.K., in 2016, on the occasion of the university's fiftieth anniversary, and the [[Jadavpur University]] Kolkata in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/ex-cea-kaushik-basu-says-slowing-gdp-growth-cause-for-concern/articleshow/67238788.cms|title=Ex-CEA Kaushik Basu says slowing GDP growth cause for concern|date=2018-12-25|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref>

==Personal life and beliefs==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2021}}
Kaushik Basu is married to [[Alaka Malwade Basu]] with two children, Karna and Diksha. Alaka is a professor at Cornell's Department of Development Sociology and has been a visiting professor at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in New Delhi.

===Economic and political views===
Kaushik Basu believes that good moral qualities are essential for growth and development within the economy. Honesty, trustworthiness and integrity are important qualities that need to be inculcated in an individual for personal development as well as within the society for development. Basu also feels the need to promote quality thinking in government and public debate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Business Standard |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/lunchbs-kaushik-basu/434180/ |title=Lunch with BS: Kaushik Basu |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=3 May 2011 |access-date=26 March 2012}}</ref>

===Views on bribery===
In his paper, 'Why, for a class of Bribes, the act of ''Giving'' Bribes should be treated as legal", Basu refers to certain bribes as 'Harassment Bribes' that are given to get what a person is legally entitled to such as a ration card or a passport. In such cases, only the act of taking a bribe should be illegal. This will cause a divergence in the interests of the bribe giver and taker and the bribe giver will be willing to co-operate to help the bribe taker get caught. This view has been under a lot of public debate.<ref>http://finmin.nic.in/workingpaper/act_giving_bribe_legal.pdf</ref>

==Career==
Over the years Basu has held visiting professorships at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the [[Université catholique de Louvain]]'s [[Center for Operations Research and Econometrics]] (CORE) in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], Belgium, and the [[London School of Economics]], where he was a distinguished visitor in 1993. Additionally, he was a visiting scientist at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], a [[public university]] in Kolkata, India.

Before his appointment as the [[World Bank]]'s Chief Economist, Basu was the Chief Economic Adviser to India's Ministry of Finance while on leave from Cornell University where he is Professor of Economics and the C.&nbsp;Marks Professor of International Studies. A Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] and recipient of the Mahalanobis Memorial Medal, Basu has published scientific papers in [[development economics]], [[game theory]], [[industrial organisation]], [[political economy]], the economics of [[child labour]],<ref>{{Cite journal

In 1992 he founded the Centre for Development Economics at the Delhi School of Economics, and served as its first executive director until 1996.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5316978.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Kaushik Basu appointed eco advisor to FM | date=9 December 2009}}</ref>

His entry into government in 2009 was a new experience. In an interview with the Bengali magazine ''Desh'', he said his earlier experience of government, when he was setting up CDE, was not a happy one. Letters and phone calls were met with no response. In desperation he went to see the then Finance Minister, [[Manmohan Singh]]. Many bureaucrats saw him waiting to meet the Minister. Thereafter their behaviour changed so markedly that he toyed with the idea of writing to the Minister to visit him periodically but not to disturb the Minister, just to sit in his waiting area for a while and go away.

Kaushik Basu is a columnist for ''[[BBC News Online]]'', the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', Business Standard and is the author of several books on economics and a play, ''Crossings at Benaras Junction'', which was published in ''The Little Magazine'' (vol. 6, 2005). He is the editor of the Oxford Companion to Economics in India, published by [[Oxford University Press]] (February 2007), which is a compendium on the Indian economy.

On 5 September 2012, he was appointed Chief Economist at the [[World Bank]].<ref name=press>{{cite press release |title=World Bank Appoints Kaushik Basu Chief Economist |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/09/05/world-bank-appoints-kaushik-basu-chief-economist |publisher=World Bank |date=5 September 2012 |access-date=7 September 2012}}</ref>

He is the Editor of ''Social Choice and Welfare'', Associate Editor of ''Japanese Economic Review'', and is on the Board of Editors of the ''World Bank Economic Review''.
