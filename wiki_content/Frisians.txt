From the 3rd through the 5th centuries Frisia suffered [[marine transgression]]s that made most of the land uninhabitable, aggravated by a change to a cooler and wetter climate.<ref>{{Citation |last=Berglund |first=Björn E. |year=2002 |contribution=Human impact and climate changes—synchronous events and a causal link? |title=Quaternary International |volume=105 |publisher=Elsevier |publication-date=2003 |page=10 |issue=1 }}</ref><ref name=Ejstrud>{{Citation |last1=Ejstrud |first1=Bo |year=2008 |editor1-last=Ejstrud |editor1-first=Bo |editor2-last=Maarleveld |editor2-first=Thijs J. |title=The Migration Period, Southern Denmark and the North Sea |publisher=Maritime Archaeology Programme |publication-date=2008 |location=Esbjerg |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/14806111/The-Migration-Period-southern-Denmark-and-the-North-Sea |isbn=978-87-992214-1-7 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Issar |first=Arie S. |year=2003 |title=Climate Changes during the Holocene and their Impact on Hydrological Systems |publisher=Cambridge University |publication-date=2003 |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-511-06118-9 }}</ref><ref name=Louwe>{{Citation |last=Louwe Kooijmans |first=L.

By the end of the 6th century, Frisian territory had expanded westward to the [[North Sea]] coast and, in the 7th century, southward down to [[Dorestad]]. This farthest extent of Frisian territory is sometimes referred to as ''[[Frisian Kingdom|Frisia Magna]]''. Early Frisia was ruled by a [[High King]], with the earliest reference to a 'Frisian King' being dated 678.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Halbertsma|first=H.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905441031|title=Frieslands oudheid : het rijk van de Friese koningen, opkomst en ondergang|date=cop. 2000|publisher=Matrijs|others=E.H.P., historicus Cordfunke, Herbert Sarfatij|isbn=90-5345-167-6|location=Utrecht|oclc=905441031}}</ref>

In the early 8th century the Frisian nobles came into increasing conflict with the [[Franks]] to their south, resulting in a [[Frisian–Frankish wars|series of wars]] in which the [[Frankish Empire]] eventually subjugated Frisia in 734. These wars benefited attempts by Anglo-Irish missionaries (which had begun with [[Saint Boniface]]) to convert the Frisian populace to [[Christianity]], in which [[Saint Willibrord]] largely succeeded.<ref>{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=St. Willibrord}}</ref>

Some time after the death of [[Charlemagne]], the Frisian territories were in theory under the control of the [[Count of Holland]], but in practice the Hollandic counts, starting with [[Arnulf, Count of Holland|Count Arnulf]] in 993, were unable to assert themselves as the sovereign lords of Frisia. The resulting stalemate resulted in a period of time called the '[[Frisian freedom]]', a period in which [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]] (as well as central or judicial [[administration (government)|administration]]) did not exist, and in which the Frisian lands only owed their allegiance to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

During the 13th century, however, the counts of Holland became increasingly powerful and, starting in 1272, sought to reassert themselves as rightful lords of the Frisian lands in [[Friso-Hollandic Wars|a series of wars]], which (with a series of lengthy interruptions) ended in 1422 with the Hollandic conquest of Western Frisia and with the establishment of a more powerful noble class in Central and Eastern Frisia.

In 1524, Frisia became part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] and in 1568 joined the [[Dutch revolt]] against [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], king of [[Spain]], heir of the Burgundian territories; Central Frisia has remained a part of the Netherlands ever since. The eastern periphery of [[Frisia]] would become part of various German states (later [[Germany]]) and [[Denmark]]. An old tradition existed in the region of exploitation of peatlands.

==Migration to England and Scotland==

Though impossible to know exact numbers and migration patterns, research has indicated that many Frisians were part of the wave of ethnic groups to colonise areas of present-day England alongside the Angles, Saxons and [[Jutes]],<ref name="openaccess.leidenuniv.nl">{{Citation |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20850/Bremmer%20Frisians%20in%20Anglo-Saxon%20England.pdf?sequence=7 |hdl=1887/20850|title=Frisians in Anglo-Saxon England: A Historical and Toponymical Investigation|series=Fryske Nammen|year=1981|pages=45–94|publisher=Fryske Akademy|isbn=9789061715979}}</ref> starting from around the fifth century when Frisians arrived along the coastline of Kent.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-anglo-saxon-invasion-britain-is-more-germanic-than-it-thinks-a-768706.html | title=The Anglo-Saxon Invasion: Britain is More Germanic than It Thinks| newspaper=Spiegel Online| date=2011-06-16| last1=Schulz| first1=Matthias}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://dedutchman.ca/friesland/ | title=The History of the Frisian Folk}}</ref> One study found the DNA of people tested in [[The Midlands|Central England]] to be "indistinguishable" from that of Frisians.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004160|pmid = 12082121| title=Y Chromosome Evidence for Anglo-Saxon Mass Migration| journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution| volume=19| issue=7| pages=1008–1021| year=2002| last1=Weale| first1=Michael E.| last2=Weiss| first2=Deborah A.| last3=Jager| first3=Rolf F.| last4=Bradman| first4=Neil| last5=Thomas| first5=Mark G.| doi-access=free}}</ref>

Frisians principally settled in modern-day Kent, [[East Anglia]],<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2590857|title = The Frisians in East Anglia|journal = The Economic History Review|volume = 10|issue = 2|pages = 189–206|last1 = Homans|first1 = George C.|year = 1957|doi = 10.2307/2590857}}</ref> the [[East Midlands]], [[North East England]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wilcuma.org.uk/who-are-the-anglo-saxons/the-frisians/ | title=The Frisians, their tribes & allies}}</ref> and [[Yorkshire]]. Across these areas, evidence of their settlement includes place names of Frisian origin, such as [[Frizinghall]] in [[Bradford]] and [[Frieston]] in Lincolnshire.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-456984/456984_djvu.txt | title=Frisian Place-Names in England| publisher=PMLA| date=January 1918}}</ref><ref name="openaccess.leidenuniv.nl" />

Similarities in dialect between [[Great Yarmouth]] and Friesland have been noted, originating from trade between these areas during the Middle Ages.<ref>{{Cite book |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237534065 |chapter = The Position of Frisian in the Germanic Language Area|last = Gooskens|first = Charlotte|date = 2004| title = On the Boundaries of Phonology and Phonetics |editor-first = D.

In [[Scotland]], historians have noted that colonies of Angles and Frisians settled as far north as the [[River Forth]]. This corresponds to those areas of Scotland which historically constituted part of [[Northumbria]].<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Scotland to the Present Time |first=Peter Hume |last=Brown |author-link=Peter Hume Brown |page=11 |year=1911 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=British place-names in their historical setting |first=Edmund |last=McLure |page=120 |year=1910 |publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]}}</ref>

==Language==
As both the [[Anglo-Saxons]] of [[England]] and the early Frisians were formed from similar tribal confederacies, their respective languages were very similar, together forming the [[Anglo-Frisian]] family. [[Old Frisian]] is the most closely attested language to [[Old English]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/1887/1937/1/344_121.pdf |title=The origin of the Old English dialects revisited |first=Frederik |last=Kortlandt |year=1999 |publisher=[[University of Leiden]]}}</ref> and the modern Frisian dialects are in turn the closest related languages to contemporary [[English language|English]] that do not themselves derive from Old English (although the modern Frisian and English are not mutually intelligible).

The Frisian language group is divided into three mutually unintelligible languages:
*[[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], spoken in the Dutch province of [[Friesland]]
*[[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]], spoken in the German municipality of [[Saterland]] just south of [[East Frisia]]
*[[North Frisian language|North Frisian]], spoken in the German region of [[North Frisia]] (within the ''[[Districts of Germany|Kreis]]'' of [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]]) on the west coast of [[Jutland]].

Of these three languages both Saterland Frisian (2,000 speakers) and North Frisian (10,000 speakers)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/parlament/minderheitenpolitik/friesische-volksgruppe.html |title=Die friesische Volksgruppe in Schleswig-Holstein |language=de |publisher=Diet of Schleswig-Holstein |access-date=4 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004050947/http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/parlament/minderheitenpolitik/friesische-volksgruppe.html |archive-date=4 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> are endangered. West Frisian is spoken by around 350,000 native speakers in Friesland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://languagecontact.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/ELA/languages/Frisian.html |title=Frisian (North) |work=Archive of Endangered and Smaller Languages |first=Yaron |last=Matras |publisher=[[University of Manchester]]}}</ref> and as many as 470,000 when including speakers in neighbouring Groningen province.<ref name="ethnologue.com"/> West Frisian is not listed as threatened, although research published by Radboud University in 2016 has challenged that assumption.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2116603-friese-taal-met-uitsterven-bedreigd.html |title=Friese taal met uitsterven bedreigd? (Frisian language threatened with extinction?)|language=nl|author=Menno de Galan & Willem Lust |work=[[Nieuwsuur]] |publisher=NOS |date=9 July 2016 |access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref>

==Identity==
{{Main|Frisian nationalism}}
Today there exists a tripartite division of the Frisians, into [[North Frisians]], [[East Frisians]] and [[West Frisians]], caused by [[Frisia]]'s constant loss of territory in the [[Middle Ages]]. The West Frisians, in general, do not see themselves as part of a larger group of Frisians, and, according to a 1970 poll, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with the [[East Frisians|East]] or [[North Frisians]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Friesland, feit en onfeit [Frisia, 'Facts and Fiction'] |year=1970 |first=Douwe A. |last=Tamminga |language=nl |location=Leeuwarden |publisher=Junior Kamer Friesland}}</ref> Therefore, the term 'Frisian', when applied to the speakers of all three Frisian languages, is a linguistic, ethnic and/or cultural concept, not a political one.
