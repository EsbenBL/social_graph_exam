'''Tjalling Charles Koopmans''' (August 28, 1910 – February 26, 1985) was a [[Dutch American|Dutch-American]] mathematician and economist. He was the joint winner with [[Leonid Kantorovich]] of the 1975 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his work on the theory of the optimum allocation of resources.  Koopmans showed that on the basis of certain efficiency criteria, it is possible to make important deductions concerning optimum price systems.

== Biography ==
[[File:KoopmansLeuven1967.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Koopmans (1967)]]
Koopmans was born in [['s-Graveland]], [[Netherlands]]. He began his university education at the [[Utrecht University]] at seventeen, specializing in mathematics. Three years later, in 1930, he switched to theoretical physics. In 1933, he met [[Jan Tinbergen]], the winner of the 1969 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, and moved to [[Amsterdam]] to study [[mathematical economics]] under him. In addition to mathematical economics, Koopmans extended his explorations to [[econometrics]] and [[statistics]]. In 1936 he graduated from [[Leiden University]] with a PhD, under the direction of [[Hendrik Kramers]]. The title of the thesis was "Linear regression analysis of economic time series".<ref>{{cite web|author=Tjalling Koopmans |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Koopmans_1936.pdf |title=Linear regression analysis of economic time series  |year=1936}}</ref>

Koopmans moved to the [[United States]] in 1940. There he worked for a while for a government body in [[Washington D.C.]], where he published on the [[economics of transportation]] focusing on optimal routing, then moved to [[Chicago]] where he joined a research body, the [[Cowles Foundation|Cowles Commission for Research in Economics]], affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1946, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]] and in 1948 director of the Cowles Commission. Also in 1948, he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-07-23.</ref> In 1950 he became a corresponding member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001356 |title=T.C. Koopmans (1910 - 1985) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=11 May 2020}}</ref> Rising hostile opposition to the Cowles Commission by the department of economics at University of Chicago during the 1950s led Koopmans to convince the Cowles family to move it to [[Yale University]] in 1955 (where it was renamed the [[Cowles Foundation]]). He continued to publish, on the [[economics]] of optimal growth and activity analysis.

Koopmans's early works on the [[Hartree–Fock]] theory are associated with the [[Koopmans' theorem]], which is very well known in [[quantum chemistry]]. Koopmans was awarded his Nobel memorial prize (jointly with Leonid Kantorovich) for his contributions to the field of resource allocation, specifically the theory of optimal use of resources. The work for which the prize was awarded focused on activity analysis, the study of interactions between the inputs and outputs of [[Production (economics)|production]], and their relationship to [[economic efficiency]] and [[prices]]. Finally, the importance of the article by Koopmans (1942) deriving the distribution of the serial correlation coefficient was recognized by [[John von Neumann]], and it later influenced the optimal tests for a [[unit root]] by [[John Denis Sargan]] and [[Alok Bhargava]] (Sargan and Bhargava, 1983).

===Family and name===
Tjalling Charles Koopmans was a son of Sjoerd Koopmans and Wytske van der Zee; his [[middle name]] Charles was probably derived from his [[patronymic]] "Sjoerds".<ref>{{cite book |title=De Macht van Twee: Kwartierstaat van de kinderen van Hendrik Koopmans en Minke Jager |language=nl |author=Ruurd Koopmans}}</ref>

One of Sjoerd Koopmans's sisters, Gatske Koopmans, and her husband Symon van der Meer were the paternal grandparents of Nobel Prize winner [[Simon van der Meer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.familyaffairs.nl/UK/FamousData/Koopmans.html |title=Ancestors of Tjalling Koopmans |date=2010 |publisher=Family Affairs |access-date=18 March 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Tussen observatie en participatie: twee eeuwen gereformeerde en antirevolutionaire wereld in ontwikkelingsperspectief|language=nl |author=D.Th.

Tjalling had two brothers, one of whom was [[theologian]] Rev. Dr [[Jan Koopmans]], who in 1940, early during the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]], wrote the widely distributed pamphlet "''Bijna te laat''" ("''Almost too late''", 30,000 copies), warning about the future of the Jews under the Nazi regime.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dewulf |first=Jeroen |date=1 December 2010 |title=Spirit of Resistance: Dutch Clandestine Literature During the Nazi Occupation |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |page=125 |isbn=978-1571134936 }}</ref> In 1945, towards the end of the war, he witnessed an execution of hostages in [[Amsterdam]] from behind a window and was mortally wounded by a stray bullet.<ref>{{cite book |last=van Istendael |first=Geert |date=1 July 2005 |title=Mijn Nederland |trans-title=My Netherlands |language=nl |publisher=Atlas-Contact |isbn= 9789045005195}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1975/koopmans-bio.html |title=Tjalling C.
