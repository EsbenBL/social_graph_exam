From the [[University of California, Irvine]], Anderson earned an M.A in [[Sociology]] in 2002 and a Ph.D. in 2004 with a dissertation that became his book ''In the Game: Gay Athletes and the Cult of Masculinity'',<ref>{{cite book|series=Sport, Culture, and Social Relations|author=Anderson, Eric|title=In the Game|publisher=Suny Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ingame00eric/page/222 222]|year=2005|isbn=0-7914-6533-0|url=https://archive.org/details/ingame00eric/page/222}}</ref> which the [[American Library Association]] recognized as Outstanding Academic Title for that year (2005). Before joining the [[University of Winchester]] in 2011, Anderson completed post-doctoral work with [[Michael Kimmel]] at the [[State University of New York]], Stony Brook. He then worked as an Assistant Professor at the [[University of Bath]] from 2005 to 2010, as well as a Visiting Professor at the [[University of California Irvine]]. He was promoted to Professor in 2011 and given a chair in Masculinities, Sexualities and Sport.

==Scholarship==
Anderson is considered a leading figure in multiple academic subfields, including [[men's studies]] and men's sexualities. He has written 11 books and over 50 peer-reviewed academic journal articles covering multiple aspects of sexualities and gender, frequently related to male team sport athletes.

His autobiography, ''[[Trailblazing]]'', documents the story of his coming out as the first openly gay high school coach in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite book|title=Trailblazing: The True Story of America's First Openly Gay Track Coach|publisher=Alyson Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/trailblazingtrue0000ande/page/304 304]|isbn=1555835244|author=Anderson, Eric|year=2000|url=https://archive.org/details/trailblazingtrue0000ande/page/304}}</ref> which [[Booklist]] described as, "quite possibly the best coming-out story ever told".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/trailblazingtrue0000ande/page/210|title=Trailblazing: The True Story of America's First Openly Gay Track Coach, by Eric Anderson|publisher=Booklist Online|pages=[https://archive.org/details/trailblazingtrue0000ande/page/210 210]|isbn=978-1555835248|year=2000}}</ref> Also recognizing this book, the journal, ''Sociology of Sport Journal'', held a symposium on its relevance to understanding decreasing homophobia in sport.<ref>{{cite web|title=SSJ Review Symposium|url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/ssj-back-issues/SSJVolume18Issue4December/TrailblazingTheStoryofAmericasFirstOpenlyGayTrackCoach}}</ref>

His book ''Inclusive Masculinity: The Changing Nature of Masculinities'' changed the way masculinity scholars theorized the relationship between masculinity and homophobia. His theory, [[Inclusive masculinity|Inclusive Masculinity Theory]], and its embedded notion of [[homohysteria]], explains how homophobia regulates gender. In subsequent works, Anderson uses empirical evidence to show that young heterosexual men's masculinities are becoming softer and more inclusive.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Eric Anderson|title=Sport, Masculinities and Sexualities|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0415540377|pages=216}}</ref> His (2014) book ''21st Century Jocks: Sporting Men and Contemporary Heterosexuality''<ref>{{cite book|author=Anderson, Eric|title=System Cookie Warning|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|edition=1st|year=2014|pages=241|isbn=978-1137550668}}</ref> documents heterosexual men cuddling in bed together,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/straight-men-cuddle-guys-study_n_5241953|title=93 Percent Of Straight Men In This Study Said They've Cuddled With Another Guy|work=HuffPost|date=May 1, 2014|author=Thomas, Emily}}</ref> kissing each other on the lips,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/04/straight-men-kissing-homophobia|title=Straight men kissing more|author=Lucy Tobin|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> and engaging in intense emotional intimacy with other men, something known as a [[bromance]].<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Universidad de la Laguna|title=Theorizing Masculinitis for a New Generation|author=Anderson, Eric|year=2013|issue=66}}</ref>

Anderson's scholarship also examines the problems of [[monogamy]]. His (2012) book, ''The Monogamy Gap: Men, Love and the Reality of Cheating'' with [[Oxford University Press]]<ref>{{cite book|series=Sexuality, Identity, and Society|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=The Monogamy Gap: Men, Love and the Reality of Cheating|year=2012|pages=256|edition=1st|isbn=978-0199777921}}</ref> has received a great deal of international media attention,<ref>{{cite news|author=Larson, Vicki|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-men-need-to-cheat_b_1170015|title=Why Men Need To Cheat|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=January 4, 2012|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref> including multiple television appearances, because the evidence of his 120 interviews suggests that monogamy causes difficulties in relationships, and thus cheating becomes a rational response to the unreasonable cultural mandates of sexual fidelity.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-cheating/2012/02/08/gIQANGdaBR_story.html|author=Anderson, Eric|title=Five myths about cheating|date=February 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=London Evening Standard|title=Why men must be free to embrace their inner slut|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/why-men-must-be-free-to-embrace-their-inner-slut-7545039.html|date=March 8, 2012|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref> His work on monogamy also examines why middle-age women cheat, not because they are emotionally unfulfilled, but instead, like men, they desire sex outside of the relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/47404-why-women-cheat.html|title=The Real Reason Women Cheat|work=LiveScience.com}}</ref>

Anderson's primary research partner is Dr [[Mark McCormack]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://markmccormackphd.com/|title=Mark McCormack, PhD}}</ref> Together, in a [[Sex Roles]] symposium they examine and advance the notion of [[homohysteria]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Influence of Declining Homophobia on Men's Gender in the United States: An Argument for the Study of Homohysteria|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0358-8|volume=71|issue=3–4|journal=Sex Roles|pages=109–120|author=McCormack, Mark|year=2014|s2cid=143889593|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/12142/1/12142.pdf}}</ref> Anderson and McCormack also have developed the understanding that decreasing cultural homophobia positively impacts the lives of [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] men<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Decreasing Significance of Stigma in the Lives of Bisexual Men: Keynote Address, Bisexual Research Convention, London|doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.571985|volume=11|issue=2–3|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|pages=195–206|author=Ripley, Matthew|year=2011|s2cid=54509250|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/26216/2/2011%20The%20Decreasing%20Significance%20of%20Stigma%20in%20the%20Lives%20of%20Bisexual%20Men%20-%20Journal%20of%20Bisexuality.pdf}}</ref> and bisexual women.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sixth form girls and bisexual burden|doi=10.1080/09589236.2013.877383|volume=25|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|pages=24–34|author=Anderson, Eric|year=2016|s2cid=59039849|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/12141/1/12141.pdf}}</ref> They have a forthcoming book with [[Columbia University Press]], that examines bisexual men's lives in Los Angeles, New York and London, research that has been funded by the [[American Institute of Bisexuality]] and has been featured by ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=The Scientific Quest to Prove Bisexuality Exists|date=March 20, 2014|author=Denizet-Lewis, Benoit|page=MM20}}</ref>
