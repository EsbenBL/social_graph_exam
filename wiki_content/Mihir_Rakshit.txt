== Education and teaching career ==

As a student of economics in [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], [[Calcutta]],<ref>It was a College then, not an autonomous University.</ref> he received valuable guidance from teachers like [[Bhabatosh Datta]] and Tapas Majumdar.

His [[PhD]] guides were [[Richard Lipsey]] and S. A. Ozga and the title of the thesis was ''Monetary Factors in the Theory of Growth''.

While at Burdwan University, he wrote a textbook in Bengali,<ref>[http://dli.serc.iisc.ernet.in/handle/2015/455608 ''অর্থনীতি (মূল্যতত্ত্বের উপক্রমণিকা)'']</ref> which became quite popular among college teachers of Economics of those times, as well as among aspirant young economists.
