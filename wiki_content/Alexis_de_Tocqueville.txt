'''Alexis Charles Henri Clérel, comte de Tocqueville'''  ({{IPA-fr|a.lɛk.si‿də tɔk.vil|lang}}; 29 July 1805{{snd}}16 April 1859),<ref name="EB1911" /> colloquially known as '''Tocqueville''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|k|v|ɪ|l|,_|ˈ|t|oʊ|k|-}}),<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/tocqueville "Tocqueville"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> was a French [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], [[diplomat]], [[Political science|political scientist]], [[political philosopher]] and [[historian]]. He is best known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (appearing in two volumes, 1835 and 1840) and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]'' (1856). In both, he analysed the improved [[living standards]] and social conditions of individuals as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. ''Democracy in America'' was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States and is today considered an early work of [[sociology]] and [[political science]].

Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the [[July Monarchy]] (1830–1848) and then during the [[Second French Republic|Second Republic]] (1849–1851) which succeeded the [[French Revolution of 1848|February 1848 Revolution]]. He retired from political life after [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoléon Bonaparte]]'s [[French coup of 1851|2 December 1851 coup]] and thereafter began work on ''The Old Regime and the Revolution''.<ref name="Paul R Hansen 2009 p 3">{{cite book|first=Paul R.|last=Hansen|title=Contesting the French Revolution|date=February 2009|page=3|isbn=978-1-4051-6084-1|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}</ref> Tocqueville argued the importance of the [[French Revolution]] was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. He believed the failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals.

Tocqueville was a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] who advocated [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] and was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.<ref name="Paul R Hansen 2009 p 3"/> During his time in parliament, he sat on the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jennings |first1=Jeremy |title=Revolution and the Republic: A History of Political Thought in France Since the Eighteenth Century |url=https://archive.org/details/revolutionrepubl00jenn |url-access=limited |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/revolutionrepubl00jenn/page/n198 188]}}</ref> but the complex and restless nature of his liberalism has led to contrasting interpretations and admirers across the political spectrum.<ref name="Jaume">{{cite book |last1=Jaume |first1=Lucien |title=Tocqueville: The Aristocratic Sources of Liberty |date=2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=6 |quote=The “liberal” label is not misplaced, because Tocqueville described himself as a liberal.}}</ref><ref name="Kahan2">{{cite book |last1=Kahan |first1=Alan S. |title=Alexis de Tocqueville |date=2010 |publisher=A&C Black |pages=112–122}}</ref><ref name="Sankar">{{cite book |last1=Muthu |first1=Sankar |title=Empire and Modern Political Thought |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=261–291 |chapter=Republicanism, Liberalism, and Empire in Postrevolutionary France}}</ref><ref name="Richter">{{cite journal |last1=Richter |first1=Melvin |title=Tocqueville and Guizot on democracy: from a type of society to a political regime |journal=History of European Ideas |date=2004 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=61–82|doi=10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2003.08.006 |s2cid=143728735 }}</ref> Regarding his political position, Tocqueville wrote "the word '[[Left-wing politics|left]]' is [...] the word I wanted to attach to my name so that it would remain attached to it forever".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jardin |first1=Andre |title=Tocqueville: A Biography |date=1989 |publisher=Macmillan |page=299}}</ref>

== Life ==
Tocqueville came from an old [[Normans|Norman]] aristocratic family. He was the great-grandson of the statesman [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], who had been guillotined in 1794. His parents, Hervé Louis François Jean Bonaventure Clérel, Count of Tocqueville, an officer of the Constitutional Guard of King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]; and Louise Madeleine Le Peletier de Rosanbo narrowly escaped the [[guillotine]] due to the fall of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] in 1794.<ref name=KahanThinkers>{{cite book|last1=Kahan|first1=Alan S.|editor1-last=Meadowcroft|editor1-first=John|title=Major conservative and libertarian thinkers|publisher=Bloomsbury|date=2013|chapter=Alexis de Tocqueville|volume=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZi9FlQLoM4C|access-date=25 May 2017|isbn=9781441176998}}</ref>

Under the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon Restoration]], Tocqueville's father became a noble [[Peerage|peer]] and [[Prefect (France)|prefect]].<ref name=KahanThinkers/> Tocqueville attended the [[Lycée Fabert]] in [[Metz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lycee-fabert.com/histoire/index.html|title=Le lycée Fabert: 1000 ans d'histoire|language=fr|website=Lycée Fabert|access-date=18 September 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708125530/http://www.lycee-fabert.com/histoire/index.html|archive-date=8 July 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Cloître sainte Constance (lycée Fabert de Metz).JPG|thumb|240px|left|The Fabert School in [[Metz]], where Tocqueville was a student between 1817 and 1823]]
Tocqueville, who despised the [[July Monarchy]] (1830–1848), began his political career in 1839. From 1839 to 1851, he served as member of the lower house of parliament for the [[Manche]] [[Departments of France|department]] ([[Valognes]]). He sat on the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jardin|first1=Andre|title=Tocqueville: A Biography|date=1989|publisher=Macmillan|pages=386–387}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Liberty and democracy: It took a Frenchman|url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2006/11/23/it-took-a-frenchman|agency=The Economist|date=23 November 2006}}</ref> defended [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] views and upheld [[free trade]] while supporting the [[French rule in Algeria|colonisation of Algeria]] carried on by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]]'s regime.

In 1842, he was elected as a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=1842&year-max=1842&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=12 April 2021|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

In 1847, he sought to found a Young Left (''Jeune Gauche'') party which would advocate wage increases, a [[progressive tax]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kahan|first1=Alan S.|title=Alexis de Tocqueville|date=2010|publisher=A&C Black |page=101}}</ref> and other labor concerns in order to undermine the appeal of the socialists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaume|first1=Lucien|title=Tocqueville: The Aristocratic Sources of Liberty|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=84}}</ref> Tocqueville was also elected general counsellor of Manche in 1842 and became the president of the department's general council between 1849 and 1852; he resigned as he refused to pledge allegiance to the Second Empire. According to one account, Tocqueville's political position became untenable during this time in the sense that he was mistrusted by both the left and right and was looking for an excuse to leave France.<ref name=twsC11r44>{{cite news|author=Joshua Kaplan|title=Political Theory: The Classic Texts and their Continuing Relevance|publisher=The Modern Scholar|quote=14 lectures; (lectures #11 & #12) – see disc 6.|year=2005}}</ref>

=== Travels ===
In 1831, Tocqueville obtained from the July Monarchy a mission to examine prisons and penitentiaries in the United States and proceeded there with his lifelong friend [[Gustave de Beaumont]]. While he did visit some prisons, Tocqueville traveled widely in the United States and took extensive notes about his observations and reflections.<ref name=twsC11r44/> He returned within nine months and published a report, but the real result of his tour was ''[[Democracy in America|De la démocratie en Amérique]]'', which appeared in 1835.<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Tocqueville, Alexis Henri Charles Maurice Clerel, Comte de|volume=26|page=1043}}</ref> Beaumont also wrote an account of their travels in ''Jacksonian America: Marie or Slavery in the United States'' (1835).<ref>Gustave de Beaumont.

Apart from North America, Tocqueville also made an observational tour of England, producing {{lang|fr|Memoir on Pauperism}}. In 1841 and 1846, he traveled to the [[French Algeria|French colony of Algeria]]. His first travel inspired his {{lang|fr|Travail sur l'Algérie}}, in which he criticized the French model of [[Colonialism|colonisation]] which emphasized [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to [[Western culture]], advocating that the [[Government of France|French government]] instead adopt a form of [[indirect rule]], which avoided mixing different populations together. He went as far as openly advocating [[racial segregation]] between European colonists and [[Arabs]] through the implementation of two different legislative systems for each ethnic group (a half century before implementation of the [[Indigénat|1881 Indigenous code]] based on religion).{{fact|date=April 2021}}

In 1835, Tocqueville made a journey through Ireland. His observations provide one of the best pictures of how Ireland stood before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] (1845–1849). The observations chronicle the growing Catholic middle class and the appalling conditions in which most Catholic tenant farmers lived. Tocqueville made clear both his opposition to aristocratic power and his affinity for his Irish co-religionists.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville (1990). ''Journey in Ireland, July–August 1835''. Catholic University of America Press: Washington, D.C.</ref>

After the fall of the July Monarchy during the [[French Revolution of 1848]], Tocqueville was [[1848 French Constituent Assembly election|elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848]], where he became a member of the commission charged with the drafting of the new Constitution of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] (1848–1851). He defended [[bicameralism]] and the election of the [[President of France|President of the Republic]] by [[universal suffrage]]. As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the labouring population of Paris, universal suffrage was conceived as a means to counteract the revolutionary spirit of Paris.

During the Second Republic, Tocqueville sided with the [[Party of Order]] against the socialists. A few days after the February insurrection, he believed that a violent clash between the Parisian workers' population led by socialists agitating in favour of a "Democratic and Social Republic" and the conservatives, which included the aristocracy and the rural population, was inescapable. As Tocqueville had foreseen, these social tensions eventually exploded during the [[June Days Uprising]] of 1848.<ref name="Paris, 1999">"Regularization" is a term used by Tocqueville himself, see {{lang|fr|Souvenirs}}, Third part, pp. 289–290 French ed. (Paris, [[Éditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], 1999).</ref>

Led by [[Louis Eugène Cavaignac|General Cavaignac]], the suppression was supported by Tocqueville, who advocated the "regularization" of the [[state of siege]] declared by Cavaignac and other measures promoting suspension of the constitutional order.<ref name="Paris, 1999"/> Between May and September, Tocqueville participated in the Constitutional Commission which wrote the new Constitution. His proposals underlined the importance of his North American experience as his amendment about the President and his reelection.<ref>Coutant Arnaud, ''Tocqueville et la constitution democratique'', Paris, Mare et Martin, 2008, 680 p.

=== Minister of Foreign Affairs ===
[[File:Commission révision Constitution 1851.JPG|thumb|250px|Tocqueville at the 1851 "Commission de la révision de la Constitution à l'Assemblée nationale"]]
A supporter of Cavaignac and of the Party of Order, Tocqueville accepted an invitation to enter [[Odilon Barrot]]'s government as [[Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 3 June to 31 October 1849. During the troubled days of June 1849, he pleaded with Interior Minister [[Jules Armand Dufaure]] for the reestablishment of the state of siege in the capital and approved the arrest of demonstrators. Tocqueville, who since February 1848 had supported laws restricting political freedoms, approved the two laws voted immediately after the June 1849 days which restricted the liberty of clubs and [[freedom of the press]].<ref name="Tocqueville 2006">Joseph Epstein, ''Alexis De Tocqueville: Democracy's Guide'', HarperCollins Publishing, 2006, p. 148.</ref>

This active support in favor of laws restricting political freedoms stands in contrast of his defense of freedoms in ''Democracy in America''. According to Tocqueville, he favored order as "the ''[[sine qua non]]'' for the conduct of serious politics. He [hoped] to bring the kind of stability to French political life that would permit the steady growth of liberty unimpeded by the regular rumblings of the earthquakes of revolutionary change″.<ref name="Tocqueville 2006"/>

Tocqueville had supported Cavaignac against [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoléon Bonaparte]] for the presidential election of 1848. Opposed to Louis Napoléon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup which followed his election, Tocqueville was among the deputies who gathered at the [[10th arrondissement of Paris]] in an attempt to resist the coup and have Napoleon III judged for "high treason" as he had violated the constitutional limit on terms of office. Detained at [[Vincennes]] and then released, Tocqueville, who supported the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Restoration]] of the [[Bourbons]] against Napoleon III's [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] (1851–1871), quit political life and retreated to his castle ({{lang|fr|[https://www.chateaudetocqueville.com/ Château de Tocqueville]}}).<ref name="ReferenceA">Epstein, ''Alexis De Tocqueville: Democracy's Guide'' (2006), p. 160.</ref>

Against this image of Tocqueville, biographer Joseph Epstein has concluded: "Tocqueville could never bring himself to serve a man he considered a usurper and despot. He fought as best he could for the political liberty in which he so ardently believed—had given it, in all, thirteen years of his life [....]. He would spend the days remaining to him fighting the same fight, but conducting it now from libraries, archives, and his own desk".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> There, he began the draft of {{lang|fr|L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution}}, publishing the first tome in 1856, but leaving the second one unfinished.

=== Death ===
A longtime sufferer from bouts of [[tuberculosis]], Tocqueville would eventually succumb to the disease on 16 April 1859 and was buried in the Tocqueville cemetery in [[Normandy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Tocqueville's professed religion was Roman Catholicism.<ref>Tocqueville, Alexis de. ''Democracy in America'', Chicago: University of Chicago, 2000, pp. 282–283.</ref> He saw religion as being compatible with both equality and individualism, but felt that religion would be strongest when separated from politics.<ref name=twsC11r44/>

== ''Democracy in America'' ==
{{main|Democracy in America}}
[[File:Page from original working manuscript of Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from original working [[manuscript]] of ''[[Democracy in America]]'', {{circa|1840}}]]
In ''[[Democracy in America]]'', published in 1835, Tocqueville wrote of the [[New World]] and its burgeoning democratic order. Observing from the perspective of a detached social scientist, Tocqueville wrote of his travels through the United States in the early 19th century when the [[Market Revolution]], [[Manifest destiny|Western expansion]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]] were radically transforming the fabric of American life.<ref name=twsC11r44/>

As emphasized in Introduction to Book I, the purpose of the work is somewhat beyond the American democracy itself, which was rather an illustration to the philosophical claim that democracy is an effect of [[industrialization]]. In a sense, Tocqueville anticipated [[Karl Marx|Marx]]’s viewpoint that history is determined by development and changes of socio-economic conditions — the so-called formations that are described by specific [[productive forces]] and [[relations of production]]. This focus on the philosophy of history justifies a certain ambiguity in using the word 'democracy' and explains why Tocqueville even ignores the intents of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] regarding the American political system:
{{quote|To pursue the central idea of his study — a democratic revolution caused by industrialization, as exemplified by America — Tocqueville persistently refers to democracy. This is in fact very different from what the Founding Fathers of the United States meant. Moreover, Tocqueville himself is not quite consistent in using the word ‘democracy’, applying it alternately to representative government, universal suffrage or majority-based governance.
|[[Andranik Tangian]] (2020) ''Analytical Theory of Democracy'', pp. 193-194<ref name="Tangian2020">{{Cite book|last=Tangian |first=Andranik |date=2020|title=Analytical Theory of Democracy. Vols. 1 and 2

According to [[political scientist]] Joshua Kaplan, one purpose of writing ''Democracy in America'' was to help the people of France get a better understanding of their position between a fading [[Aristocracy|aristocratic order]] and an emerging [[Democracy|democratic order]] and to help them sort out the confusion.<ref name=twsC11r44/> Tocqueville saw democracy as an equation that balanced [[liberty]] and [[Egalitarianism|equality]], concern for the individual as well as for the community.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Tocqueville was an ardent supporter of liberty. "I have a passionate love for liberty, law, and respect for rights", he wrote. "I am neither of the revolutionary party nor of the conservative. [...] Liberty is my foremost passion". He wrote of "Political Consequences of the Social State of the Anglo-Americans" by saying: "But one also finds in the human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak to want to bring the strong down to their level, and which reduces men to preferring equality in servitude to inequality in freedom".<ref>See Volume One, Part I, Chapter 3.</ref>

The above is often misquoted as a slavery quote because of previous translations of the French text. The most recent translation by Arthur Goldhammer in 2004 translates the meaning to be as stated above. Examples of misquoted sources are numerous on the internet,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notable-quotes.com/s/slavery_quotes.html|title=Slavery Quotes|publisher=Notable-quotes.com|access-date=23 June 2012}}</ref> but the text does not contain the words "Americans were so enamored by equality" anywhere.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

His view on government reflects his belief in liberty and the need for individuals to be able to act freely while respecting others' rights. Of centralized government, he wrote that it "excels in preventing, not doing".<ref>See Volume One, Part I, Chapter 5, George Lawrence translation.</ref>

Tocqueville continues to comment on equality by saying: "Furthermore, when citizens are all almost equal, it becomes difficult for them to defend their independence against the aggressions of power. As none of them is strong enough to fight alone with advantage, the only guarantee of liberty is for everyone to combine forces. But such a combination is not always in evidence".<ref>[[q:Alexis de Tocqueville]].</ref>

Tocqueville explicitly cites inequality as being incentive for the poor to become rich and notes that it is not often that two generations within a family maintain success and that it is [[inheritance law]]s that split and eventually break apart someone's estate that cause a constant cycle of churn between the poor and the rich, thereby over generations making the poor rich and the rich poor. He cites protective laws in France at the time that protected an estate from being split apart among heirs, thereby preserving wealth and preventing a churn of wealth such as was perceived by him in 1835 within the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

=== On civil and political society and the individual ===
{{liberalism sidebar}}
Tocqueville's main purpose was to analyze the functioning of political society and various forms of political associations, although he brought some reflections on civil society too (and relations between political and civil society). For Tocqueville, as for [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]], civil society was a sphere of private entrepreneurship and civilian affairs regulated by [[civil code]].<ref name=zaleski>{{cite journal|last=Zaleski|first=Pawel|url=http://zaleski.wex.pl/2008%20tocqueville%20on%20civilian%20society.pdf|title=Tocqueville on Civilian Society.

According to [[political scientist]] Joshua Kaplan, Tocqueville did not originate the concept of individualism, instead he changed its meaning and saw it as a "calm and considered feeling which deposes each citizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows and to withdraw into the circle of family and friends [...]. [W]ith this little society formed to his taste, he gladly leaves the greater society to look for itself".<ref name=twsC11r44/> While Tocqueville saw [[egotism]] and [[selfishness]] as vices, he saw individualism as not a failure of feeling, but as a way of thinking about things which could have either positive consequences such as a willingness to work together, or negative consequences such as isolation and that individualism could be remedied by improved understanding.<ref name=twsC11r44/>

When individualism was a positive force and prompted people to work together for common purposes and seen as "self-interest properly understood", then it helped to counterbalance the danger of the [[tyranny of the majority]] since people could "take control over their own lives" without government aid.<ref name=twsC11r44/> According to Kaplan, Americans have a difficult time accepting Tocqueville's criticism of the stifling intellectual effect of the "omnipotence of the majority" and that Americans tend to deny that there is a problem in this regard.<ref name=twsC11r44/>

Others such as the Catholic writer Daniel Schwindt disagree with Kaplan's interpretation, arguing instead that Tocqueville saw individualism as just another form of egotism and not an improvement over it.<ref name="Daniel Schwindt">{{cite web|url=https://ethikapolitika.org/2014/01/06/refuting-tocqueville-way-tocqueville/|title=Refuting Tocqueville by Way of Tocqueville|author=Daniel Schwindt|date=January 2014|publisher=[[Ethika Politika]]|access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref> To make his case, Schwindt provides citations such as the following: <blockquote>Egoism springs from a blind instinct; individualism from wrong-headed thinking rather than from depraved feelings. It originates as much from defects of intelligence as from the mistakes of the heart. Egoism blights the seeds of every virtue; individualism at first dries up only the source of public virtue. In the longer term it attacks and destroys all the others and will finally merge with egoism.<ref name="Daniel Schwindt"/></blockquote>

=== On democracy and new forms of tyranny ===
{{conservatism sidebar}}
Tocqueville warned that modern democracy may be adept at inventing new forms of tyranny because radical equality could lead to the materialism of an expanding bourgeoisie and to the selfishness of individualism. "In such conditions, we might become so enamored with 'a relaxed love of present enjoyments' that we lose interest in the future of our descendants...and meekly allow ourselves to be led in ignorance by a despotic force all the more powerful because it does not resemble one", wrote ''The New Yorker'''s James Wood.<ref>James Wood. [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/05/17/tocqueville-in-america "Tocqueville In America"]. ''The New Yorker''. 17 May 2010.</ref> Tocqueville worried that if [[despotism]] were to take root in a modern democracy, it would be a much more dangerous version than the oppression under the Roman emperors or tyrants of the past who could only exert a pernicious influence on a small group of people at a time.<ref name=twsC11r44/>

In contrast, a despotism under a democracy could see "a multitude of men", uniformly alike, equal, "constantly circling for petty pleasures", unaware of fellow citizens and subject to the will of a powerful state which exerted an "immense protective power".<ref name=twsC11r44/> Tocqueville compared a potentially despotic democratic government to a protective parent who wants to keep its citizens (children) as "perpetual children" and which does not break men's wills, but rather guides it and presides over people in the same way as a shepherd looking after a "flock of timid animals".<ref name=twsC11r44/>

=== On American social contract ===
Tocqueville's penetrating analysis sought to understand the peculiar nature of American political life. In describing the American, he agreed with thinkers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Montesquieu]] that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried to understand why the United States was so different from Europe in the last throes of [[aristocracy]]. In contrast to the aristocratic ethic, the United States was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Tocqueville writes: "Among a democratic people, where there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living. [...] Labor is held in honor; the prejudice is not against but in its favor".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper/DETOC/ch2_18.htm|title=Tocqueville: Book II Chapter 18|publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu|access-date=23 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607070314/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/ch2_18.htm|archive-date=7 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished [[primogeniture]] and [[Fee tail|entails]], resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation.<ref name=twsC11r44/>

In contrast, landed elites in the United States were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of [[primogeniture]], which meant that as time went by large estates became broken up within a few generations which in turn made the children more equal overall.<ref name=twsC11r44/> According to Joshua Kaplan's Tocqueville, it was not always a negative development since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern.<ref name=twsC11r44/> Overall, hereditary fortunes in the new democracies became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

[[File:Alexis de Tocqueville.jpg|thumb|250px|A sketch of Tocqueville]]
As Tocqueville understood it, this rapidly democratizing society had a population devoted to "middling" values which wanted to amass through hard work vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why the United States was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money and many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in the United States, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Despite maintaining that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that as the United States showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite as the widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished the United States and determined its mores and values also explained why the United States masses held elites in such contempt.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alain de Benoist|title=The Problem of Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vcgi63L2oEQC&pg=PA20|year=2011|publisher=Arktos|page=20|isbn=9781907166167}}</ref>

=== On majority rule and mediocrity ===
Beyond the eradication of old-world aristocracy, ordinary Americans also refused to defer to those possessing, as Tocqueville put it, superior talent and intelligence and these natural elites could not enjoy much share in political power as a result. Ordinary Americans enjoyed too much power and claimed too great a voice in the public sphere to defer to intellectual superiors. This culture promoted a relatively pronounced equality, Tocqueville argued, but the same mores and opinions that ensured such equality also promoted mediocrity. Those who possessed true virtue and talent were left with limited choices.<ref name=twsC11r44/>

Tocqueville said that those with the most education and intelligence were left with two choices. They could join limited intellectual circles to explore the weighty and complex problems facing society, or they could use their superior talents to amass vast fortunes in the private sector. He wrote that he did not know of any country where there was "less independence of mind, and true freedom of discussion, than in America".<ref name=twsC11r44/>

Tocqueville blamed the omnipotence of [[majority rule]] as a chief factor in stifling thinking: "The majority has enclosed thought within a formidable fence. A writer is free inside that area, but woe to the man who goes beyond it, not that he stands in fear of an inquisition, but he must face all kinds of unpleasantness in every day persecution. A career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys".<ref name=twsC11r44/> According to Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, he argued in contrast to previous political thinkers that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong, but that people were "too weak" and felt powerless as the danger is that people felt "swept up in something that they could not control".<ref name=twsC11r44/>

=== On slavery, blacks and Indians ===
Uniquely positioned at a crossroads in American history, Tocqueville's ''Democracy in America'' attempted to capture the essence of American culture and values. Though a supporter of colonialism, Tocqueville could clearly perceive the evils that black people and natives had been subjected to in the United States. Tocqueville devoted the last chapter of the first volume of ''Democracy in America'' to the question while his travel companion Gustave de Beaumont wholly focused on slavery and its fallouts for the American nation in ''Marie or Slavery in America''. Tocqueville notes among the American races: {{quote|The first who attracts the eye, the first in enlightenment, in power and in happiness, is the white man, the European, man par excellence; below him appear the Negro and the Indian. These two unfortunate races have neither birth, nor face, nor language, nor mores in common; only their misfortunes look alike. Both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit; both experience the effects of tyranny; and if their miseries are different, they can accuse the same author for them.<ref>Beginning of chapter 18 of ''Democracy in America'', "The Present and Probably Future Condition of the Three Races that Inhabit the Territory of the United States".</ref><!-- What edition, whose translation? -->}}

Tocqueville contrasted the settlers of Virginia with the middle class, religious [[Puritan]]s who founded [[New England]] and analyzed the debasing influence of slavery: {{quote|The men sent to Virginia were seekers of gold, adventurers without resources and without character, whose turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony. [...] Artisans and agriculturalists arrived afterwards[,] [...] hardly in any respect above the level of the inferior classes in England. No lofty views, no spiritual conception presided over the foundation of these new settlements. The colony was scarcely established when slavery was introduced; this was the capital fact which was to exercise an immense influence on the character, the laws and the whole future of the South. Slavery [...] dishonors labor; it introduces idleness into society, and with idleness, ignorance and pride, luxury and distress. It enervates the powers of the mind and benumbs the activity of man. On this same English foundation there developed in the North very different characteristics.<ref>''Democracy in America'', Vintage Books, 1945, pp. 31–32.</ref>}}

Tocqueville concluded that return of the Black population to Africa could not resolve the problem as he writes at the end of ''Democracy in America'': {{quote|If the colony of [[Liberia]] were able to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year, and if the Negroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage; if the Union were to supply the society with annual subsidies, and to transport the Negroes to Africa in government vessels, it would still be unable to counterpoise the natural increase of population among the blacks; and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born upon its territory within that time, it could not prevent the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the states. The Negro race will never leave those shores of the American continent to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of Europeans; and it will not disappear from the New World as long as it continues to exist. The inhabitants of the United States may retard the calamities which they apprehend, but they cannot now destroy their efficient cause.}}

In 1855, Tocqueville wrote the following text published by [[Maria Weston Chapman]] in the ''Liberty Bell: Testimony against Slavery'': {{quote|I do not think it is for me, a foreigner, to indicate to the United States the time, the measures, or the men by whom Slavery shall be abolished. Still, as the persevering enemy of despotism everywhere, and under all its forms, I am pained and astonished by the fact that the freest people in the world is, at the present time, almost the only one among civilized and Christian nations which yet maintains personal servitude; and this while serfdom itself is about disappearing, where it has not already disappeared, from the most degraded nations of Europe.<br><br>An old and sincere friend of America, I am uneasy at seeing Slavery retard her progress, tarnish her glory, furnish arms to her detractors, compromise the future career of the Union which is the guaranty of her safety and greatness, and point out beforehand to her, to all her enemies, the spot where they are to strike. As a man, too, I am moved at the spectacle of man's degradation by man, and I hope to see the day when the law will grant equal civil liberty to all the inhabitants of the same empire, as God accords the freedom of the will, without distinction, to the dwellers upon earth.<ref>In {{lang|fr|Oeuvres completes}}, Gallimard, T. VII, pp. 1663–1664.</ref>}}

=== On policies of assimilation ===
According to Tocqueville, assimilation of black people would be almost impossible and this was already being demonstrated in the Northern states. As Tocqueville predicted, formal freedom and equality and segregation would become this population's reality after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] as would the bumpy road to true integration of black people.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

However, assimilation was the best solution for Native Americans, and since they were too proud to assimilate, they would inevitably become extinct. [[Forced migration|Displacement]] was another part of America's [[Indian Removal|Indian policy]]. Both populations were "undemocratic", or without the qualities, intellectual and otherwise needed to live in a democracy. Tocqueville shared many views on assimilation and segregation of his and the coming epochs, but he opposed [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s theories as found in ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races|The Inequality of Human Races]]'' (1853–1855).<ref>See {{lang|fr|Correspondence avec Arthur de Gobineau}} as quoted by [http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/fr/art/2001/299.htm Jean-Louis Benoît]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216051008/http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/fr/art/2001/299.htm|date=16 February 2006}}</ref>

=== On the United States and Russia as future global powers ===
In his ''Democracy in America'', Tocqueville also forecast the preeminence of the United States and Russia as the two main global powers. In his book, he stated: "There are now two great nations in the world, which starting from different points, seem to be advancing toward the same goal: the Russians and the Anglo-Americans. [...] Each seems called by some secret design of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'', pp. 412–413.</ref>

=== On civil jury service ===
Tocqueville believed that the American jury system was particularly important in educating citizens in self-government and rule of law.<ref name="Civil Jury">Hans, Valerie P.; Gastil, John; and Feller, Traci, [https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/1328/ "Deliberative Democracy and the American Civil Jury"] (2014). Cornell Law Faculty Publications. Paper 1328.</ref> He often expressed how the civil jury system was one of the most effective showcases of democracy because it connected citizens with the true spirit of the justice system. In his 1835 treatise ''Democracy in America'', he explained: "The jury, and more especially the civil jury, serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for free institutions. [...] It invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy; it makes them all feel the duties which they are bound to discharge toward society; and the part which they take in the Government".<ref>Tocqueville, Alexis de ([1835] 1961). [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/ ''Democracy in America''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109091450/http://xroads.virginia.edu/%7EHYPER/DETOC/ |date=9 January 2007 }}. New York: Schocken.</ref>

Tocqueville believed that jury service not only benefited the society as a whole, but enhanced jurors' qualities as citizens. Because of the jury system, "they were better informed about the rule of law, and they were more closely connected to the state. Thus, quite independently of what the jury contributed to dispute resolution, participation on the jury had salutary effects on the jurors themselves".<ref name="Civil Jury"/>

==1841 discourse on the Conquest of Algeria==
French historian of [[colonialism]] [[Olivier LeCour Grandmaison]] has underlined how Tocqueville (as well as [[Jules Michelet]]) used the term "[[Genocide|extermination]]" to describe what was happening during the colonization of Western United States and the [[Indian removal]] period.<ref name="Negationnism">{{cite news|author=[[Olivier LeCour Grandmaison]]|title=Le négationnisme colonial|work=[[Le Monde]]|date=2 February 2005|url=http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=491|language=fr|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228040334/http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=491|archive-date=28 February 2006}}</ref> Tocqueville thus expressed himself in 1841 concerning the [[French rule in Algeria|conquest of Algeria]]: {{quote|As far as I am concerned, I came back from Africa with the pathetic notion that at present in our way of waging war we are far more barbaric than the Arabs themselves. These days, they represent civilization, we do not. This way of waging war seems to me as stupid as it is cruel. It can only be found in the head of a coarse and brutal soldier. Indeed, it was pointless to replace the Turks only to reproduce what the world rightly found so hateful in them. This, even for the sake of interest is more noxious than useful; for, as another officer was telling me, if our sole aim is to equal the Turks, in fact we shall be in a far lower position than theirs: barbarians for barbarians, the Turks will always outdo us because they are Muslim barbarians. In France, I have often heard men I respect, but do not approve of, deplore that crops should be burnt and granaries emptied and finally that unarmed men, women, and children should be seized. In my view these are unfortunate circumstances that any people wishing to wage war against the Arabs must accept. I think that all the means available to wreck tribes must be used, barring those that the human kind and the right of nations condemn. I personally believe that the laws of war enable us to ravage the country and that we must do so either by destroying the crops at harvest time or any time by making fast forays, also known as raids, whose aim is to get hold of men or flocks.<ref>1841 – Extract of {{lang|fr|Travail sur l'Algérie}}, in {{lang|fr|Œuvres complètes}}, Gallimard, Pléïade, 1991, pp. 704–705.</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison |title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France – Liberty, Equality and Colony|work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]|date=June 2001|url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}} (quoting Alexis de Tocqueville, {{lang|fr|Travail sur l'Algérie}} in {{lang|fr|Œuvres complètes}}, Paris, Gallimard, [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]], 1991, pp. 704–705).</ref> {{break|2}}Whatever the case, we may say in a general manner that all [[Freedom (political)|political freedoms]] must be [[State of emergency|suspended]] in Algeria.<ref>{{cite web|author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison|title=Tocqueville et la conquête de l'Algérie|year=2001|publisher=La Mazarine|url=http://perso.wanadoo.fr/felina/doc/alg/olcg.htm|language=fr}}</ref>}}

Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world; and second, changes in French society.<ref name="Monde diplomatique">{{cite news|author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison|title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France – Liberty, Equality and Colony|work=Le Monde diplomatique|date=June 2001|url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}}</ref> Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would "restore national pride; threatened", he believed, by "the gradual softening of social mores" in the middle classes. Their taste for "material pleasures" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it "an example of weakness and egotism".<ref name="mondediplo806">Alexis de Tocqueville, "Rapports sur l'Algérie", in {{lang|fr|Œuvres complètes}}, Paris, Gallimard, Bibliothèque de [[la Pléiade]], 1991, p. 806, quoted in {{cite news|author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison|title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France – Liberty, Equality and Colony|work=Le Monde diplomatique|date=June 2001|url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}}</ref>

Applauding the methods of [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud de la Piconnerie|General Bugeaud]], Tocqueville went so far to claim that "war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science".<ref name="mondediplo806"/>

Tocqueville advocated [[racial segregation]] in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population.<ref>{{lang|fr|Travail sur l'Algérie}}, {{lang|la|op.cit.}} p. 752. Quoted in {{cite news|author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison|title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France – Liberty, Equality and Colony|work=Le Monde diplomatique|date=June 2001|url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}}</ref> Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the [[Adolphe Crémieux|1870 Crémieux decree]] and the [[Indigénat|Indigenousness Code]], which extended [[French nationality law|French citizenship]] to European settlers and Algerian Jews whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

== Tocqueville's opposition to the invasion of Kabylie ==
[[File:Tocqueville by Daumier.jpg|thumb|250px|1849 caricature by [[Honoré Daumier]]]]
In opposition to Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison, Jean-Louis Benoît said that given the extent of racial prejudices during the colonization of Algeria, Tocqueville was one of its "most moderate supporters". Benoît said that it was wrong to assume Tocqueville was a supporter of Bugeaud despite his 1841 apologetic discourse. It seems that Tocqueville modified his views after his second visit to Algeria in 1846 as he criticized Bugeaud's desire to invade [[Kabylie]] in an 1847 speech to the Assembly.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Although Tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law, administrators, schools and so on for [[Arab]]s who had come under French control, he judged the Berber tribes of Kabylie (in his second of ''Two Letters on Algeria'', 1837) as "savages" not suited for this arrangement because he argued they would best be managed not by force of arms, but by the pacifying influences of commerce and cultural interaction.<ref name="Axel2002">{{cite book|author=Brian Keith Axel|title=From the Margins: Historical Anthropology and Its Futures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=099L2OI0WV4C&pg=PA135|date=17 May 2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8334-9|pages=135|quote=Given these cultural resemblances and "frequent, peaceful relations", Tocqueville concluded that however impenetrable their territory may be, the Kabyles would likely assimilate to French "mores and ideas" due to the "almost invincible attraction that brings savages towards civilized men."}}</ref>

Tocqueville's views on the matter were complex. Although in his 1841 report on Algeria he applauded Bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|Abd-el-Kader]]'s resistance, he had advocated in the ''Two Letters'' that the French military advance leave Kabylie undisturbed and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into Kabylie.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In the debate about the 1846 extraordinary funds, Tocqueville denounced Bugeaud's conduct of military operations and succeeded in convincing the Assembly not to vote funds in support of Bugeaud's military columns.<ref>Tocqueville, {{lang|fr|Oeuvres completes}}, III, 1, Gallimard, 1962, pp. 299–300.</ref> Tocqueville considered Bugeaud's plan to invade Kabylie despite the opposition of the Assembly as a seditious act in the face of which the government was opting for cowardice.<ref>Tocqueville, {{lang|fr|Oeuvres completes}}, III, 1, Gallimard, 1962, p. 303.</ref><ref>Tocqueville, {{lang|fr|Œuvres complètes}}, III, 1, Gallimard, 1962, pp. 299–306.</ref>

== 1847 "Report on Algeria" ==
In his 1847 "Report on Algeria", Tocqueville declared that Europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the [[European colonization of the Americas]] in order to avoid the bloody consequences.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Jean-Louis Benoît. [http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/fr/art/2001/299.htm "Arguments in favor of Tocqueville"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216051008/http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/fr/art/2001/299.htm|date=16 February 2006}}.</ref> More particularly he reminds his countrymen of a solemn caution whereby he warns them that if the methods used towards the Algerian people remain unchanged, colonization will end in a blood bath.

Tocqueville includes in his report on Algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the French government treats the various native populations of Algeria, including the various Arab tribes, independent Kabyles living in the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the powerful political leader [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|Abd-el-Kader]]. In his various letters and essays on Algeria, Tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies by which a European country can approach imperialism. In particular, the author differentiates between what he terms "dominance" and a particular version of "colonization".<ref name="Tocqueville 2001, pp. 57–64">Alexis De Tocqueville, ''Writings on Empire and Slavery'', ed. Jennifer Pitts, Johns Hopkins (Baltimore), 2001, pp. 57–64.</ref>

The latter stresses the obtainment and protection of land and passageways that promise commercial wealth. In the case of Algeria, the Port of Algiers and the control over the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] were considered by Tocqueville to be particularly valuable whereas direct control of the political operations of the entirety of Algeria was not. Thus, the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas.<ref name="Tocqueville 2001, pp. 57–64"/>

Tocqueville argued that though unpleasant, domination via violent means is necessary for colonization and justified by the laws of war. Such laws are not discussed in detail, but given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with [[just war theory]]'s ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' criteria of [[just cause]]. Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with just war theory's ''jus in bello'' criteria of [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] and discrimination.<ref>De Tocqueville. ''Writings on Empire and Slavery'', ed. Jennifer Pitts (2001), pp. 57–64, 70–78.</ref>

== ''The Old Regime and the Revolution'' ==
{{main|The Old Regime and the Revolution}}
In 1856, Tocqueville published ''The Old Regime and the Revolution''.

Tocqueville was quoted in several chapters of [[Toby Young]]'s memoirs ''[[How to Lose Friends and Alienate People (memoir)|How to Lose Friends and Alienate People]]'' to explain his observation of widespread homogeneity of thought even amongst intellectual elites at [[Harvard University]] during his time spent there.
