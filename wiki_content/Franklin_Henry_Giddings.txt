'''Franklin Henry Giddings''' (March 23, 1855&nbsp;â€“ June 11, 1931) was an [[United States|American]] [[sociologist]] and [[economist]].

==Biography==
Giddings was born at [[Sherman, Connecticut]]. He graduated from [[Union College]] (1877). For ten years he wrote items for the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] ''Republican'' and the ''Daily Union''. In 1888 he was appointed lecturer in [[political science]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]]; in 1894 he became professor of sociology at [[Columbia University]]. From 1892 to 1905 he was a vice president of the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]].

His most significant contribution is the concept of the consciousness of kind, which is a state of mind whereby one conscious being recognizes another as being of like mind. All human motives organize themselves around consciousness of kind as a determining principle. Association leads to conflict which leads to consciousness of kind through communication, imitation, toleration, co-operation, and alliance. Eventually the group achieves a self-consciousness of its own (as opposed to individual self-consciousness) from which traditions and social values can arise.

In 1914 he became one of the inaugural [[Fellow]]s of the [[American Statistical Association]].<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm List of ASA Fellows], retrieved 2016-07-16.</ref>
