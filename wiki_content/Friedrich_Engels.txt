Engels developed what is now known as [[Marxism]] together with [[Karl Marx]]. In 1845, he published ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'', based on personal observations and research in English cities. In 1848, Engels co-authored ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' with Marx and also authored and co-authored (primarily with Marx) many other works. Later, Engels supported Marx financially, allowing him to do research and write ''[[Das Kapital]]''. After Marx's death, Engels edited the second and third volumes of ''Das Kapital''. Additionally, Engels organised Marx's notes on the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'' which were later published as the "fourth volume" of ''Das Kapital''.<ref>''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', in ''Collected Works of Marx and Englels: Volumes 30, 31 and 32'' (International Publishers: New York, 1988).</ref><ref>[https://www.thecharnelhouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Isaiah-Berlin-Karl-Marx.pdf Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx'', fifth ed], page 262. Princeton University Press, 2013.</ref> In 1884, he published ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' on the basis of Marx's ethnographic research.

On 5 August 1895, aged 74, Engels died of [[laryngeal cancer]] in London. Following cremation, his ashes were scattered off [[Beachy Head]], near [[Eastbourne]].

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
[[File:280505 001 Engelshaus Barmen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Engels-Haus|Engels family house]] at [[Barmen]] (now in [[Wuppertal]]), Germany]]
Friedrich Engels was born on 28 November 1820 in [[Barmen]], [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Jülich-Cleves-Berg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Wuppertal]], Germany), as eldest son of Friedrich Engels Sr. (1796–1860) and of Elisabeth "Elise" Franziska Mauritia von Haar (1797–1873).<ref>A copy of Friedrich Engels's birth certificate appears on page 577 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 2'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975).</ref> The wealthy Engels family owned large [[textile industry|cotton-textile mills]] in Barmen and [[Salford]], both expanding industrial metropoles. Friedrich's parents were devout [[Pietism|Pietist]] Protestants<ref name="Hunt_2009" /> and they raised their children accordingly.

At the age of 13, Engels attended grammar school (''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'') in the adjacent city of [[Elberfeld]] but had to leave at 17, due to pressure from his father, who wanted him to become a businessman and start work as a mercantile apprentice in the family firm.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Friedrich Engels Facts in Encyclopedia of World Biography |url=https://biography.yourdictionary.com/friedrich-engels |access-date=8 January 2019 |publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.}}</ref> After a year in Barmen, the young Engels was in 1838 sent by his father to undertake an apprenticeship at a trading house in [[Bremen]].<ref name="engels-bio">{{Cite web |title=Lenin: Friedrich Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1895/misc/engels-bio.htm |access-date=13 February 2010 |publisher=Marxists.org}}</ref><ref name="tucker">Tucker, Robert C. ''The Marx-Engels Reader'', p. xv</ref> His parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in the family business. Their son's revolutionary activities disappointed them. It would be some years before he joined the family firm.

Whilst at Bremen, Engels began reading the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose teachings dominated German philosophy at that time. In September 1838 he published his first work, a poem entitled "The Bedouin", in the ''Bremisches Conversationsblatt'' No. 40. He also engaged in other literary work and began writing newspaper articles critiquing the societal ills of industrialisation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Progress Publishers |title=Preface by Progress Publishers |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume02/preface.htm |access-date=13 February 2010 |publisher=Marxists.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=15 November 1941 |title=Footnotes to Volume 1 of Marx Engels Collected Works |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume02/footnote.htm#188 |access-date=13 February 2010 |publisher=Marxists.org}}</ref> He wrote under the pseudonym "Friedrich Oswald" to avoid connecting his family with his provocative writings.

In 1841, Engels performed his military service in the [[Prussian Army]] as a member of the Household Artillery ({{lang-de|link=no|Garde-Artillerie-Brigade}}). Assigned to Berlin, he attended university lectures at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and began to associate with groups of [[Young Hegelians]]. He anonymously published articles in the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]],'' exposing the poor employment- and living-conditions endured by factory workers.<ref name="tucker"/> The editor of the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' was Karl Marx, but Engels would not meet Marx until late November 1842.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild: Dresden, Germany, 1972) p. 53.</ref> Engels acknowledged the influence of German philosophy on his intellectual development throughout his career.<ref name="engels-bio" /> In 1840, he also wrote: "To get the most out of life you must be active, you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young."<ref>Friedrich Engels, W.O. Henderson, p. 9</ref>

Engels developed [[atheistic]] beliefs and his relationship with his parents became strained.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Friedrich Engels |title=Letters of Marx and Engels, 1845 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/letters/45_03_17.htm |access-date=13 February 2010 |publisher=Marxists.org}}</ref>

=== Manchester and Salford ===
In 1842, his parents sent the 22-year-old Engels to [[Manchester]], England, a manufacturing centre where industrialisation was on the rise. He was to work in [[Weaste]], [[Salford]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Brooks-Pollock |first=Tom |date=11 March 2014 |title=Ten things Manchester gets the credit for when really it should be Salford |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/ten-things-manchester-gets-credit-6796109 |access-date=31 March 2020 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> in the offices of [[Baumwollspinnerei Ermen & Engels|Ermen and Engels]]'s Victoria Mill, which made sewing threads.<ref name="en-1893">{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm |title=Biography on Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref name="bbc-art1">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_1.shtml |title=Legacies – Engels in Manchester |page =1 |publisher=BBC |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=461|title=Mary Burns Superstar – Salford Star – with attitude & love xxx|website=www.salfordstar.com}}</ref> Engels's father thought that working at the Manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his radical opinions.<ref name="engels-bio"/><ref name="bbc-art1"/> On his way to Manchester, Engels visited the office of the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' in Cologne and met Karl Marx for the first time.

While in Manchester between October and November 1843, Engels wrote his first [[critique of political economy]], entitled "[[Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy]]".<ref>"Outline of a Critique of Political Economy," ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 3'' ([[International Publishers]]: New York, 1975), pp. 418–445.</ref> Engels sent the article to Paris, where Marx published it in the ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]]'' in 1844.<ref name="en-1893"/>

While observing the slums of Manchester in close detail, Engels took notes of its horrors, notably [[child labour]], the despoiled environment, and overworked and impoverished labourers.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|last=Garner|first=Dwight|date=18 August 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/books/19garner.html|title=Fox Hunter, Party Animal, Leftist Warrior|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=31 August 2020}}</ref> He sent a trilogy of articles to Marx. These were published in the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' and then in the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'', chronicling the conditions among the working class in Manchester. He later collected these articles for his influential first book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' (1845).<ref>''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', in the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels: Volume 4'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295–596.</ref> Written between September 1844 and March 1845, the book was published in German in 1845.

Archival resources contemporary to Engels's stay in Manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes, including a manuscript (MMM/10/1) held by special collections at the University of Manchester. This recounts cases seen in the Manchester Royal Infirmary, where industrial accidents dominated and which resonate with Engels's comments on the disfigured persons seen walking round Manchester as a result of such accidents.

Engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics. He frequented areas popular among members of the English [[Labour movement|labour]] and [[Chartism|Chartist]] movements, whom he met. He also wrote for several journals, including ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|The Northern Star]]'', [[Robert Owen]]'s ''[[New Moral World]],'' and the ''[[Democratic Review]]'' newspaper.<ref name="bbc-art2" /><ref>{{cite web |author=Karl Marx |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/04.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040314204539/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/04.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2004 |title=Introduction to the French Edition of Engels |year=1880 |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=13 February 2010 }}</ref><ref>Whitfield, Roy (1988) "The Double Life of Friedrich Engels."

Engels decided to return to Germany in 1844. On the way, he stopped in Paris to meet [[Karl Marx]], with whom he had an earlier correspondence. Marx had been living in Paris since late October 1843, after the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' was banned in March 1843 by Prussian governmental authorities.<ref>P.N. Fedoseyev et al, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 41–42, 49.</ref> Prior to meeting Marx, Engels had become established as a fully developed [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]] and [[scientific socialist]], independent of Marx's philosophical development.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 71.</ref>

In Paris, Marx was publishing the ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]].'' Engels met Marx for a second time at the [[Café de la Régence]] on the Place du Palais, 28 August 1844. The two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives. Marx had read and was impressed by Engels's articles on ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' in which he had written that "[a] class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages, [...] Who can demand that such a class respect this social order?"<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 4,'' p. 424.</ref> Marx adopted Engels's idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism, and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy.<ref>P.N. Fedoseyev, ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 82–83.</ref>

Engels stayed in Paris to help Marx write ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''.<ref>''The Holy Family,'' ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 4'', pp. 3–211.</ref> It was an attack on the [[Young Hegelians]] and the [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] brothers, and was published in late February 1845. Engels's earliest contribution to Marx's work was writing for the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'', edited by both Marx and [[Arnold Ruge]], in Paris in 1844. During this time in Paris, both Marx and Engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the [[League of the Just]].<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 60.</ref> The League of the Just had been formed in 1837 in France to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments. In 1839, the League of the Just participated in the 1839 rebellion fomented by the French utopian revolutionary socialist, [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]]. However, as Ruge remained a Young Hegelian in his belief, Marx and Ruge soon split and Ruge left the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher''.<ref>P.N. Fedoseyev ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' pp. 57–58.</ref> Nonetheless, following the split, Marx remained friendly enough with Ruge that he sent Ruge a warning on 15 January 1845 that the Paris police were going to execute orders against him, Marx and others at the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'' requiring all to leave Paris within 24 hours.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Letter from Marx to Ruge" (15 January 1845) contained in ''Collected Works: Volume 38'', p. 15.</ref> Marx himself was expelled from Paris by French authorities on 3 February 1845 and settled in Brussels with his wife and one daughter.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 625.</ref> Having left Paris on 6 September 1844, Engels returned to his home in Barmen, Germany, to work on his ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', which was published in late May 1845.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''. ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 625.</ref> Even before the publication of his book, Engels moved to Brussels in late April 1845, to collaborate with Marx on another book, ''[[German Ideology]]''.<ref>''German Ideology'' is located in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels'' pp. 19–539.</ref> While living in Barmen, Engels began making contact with Socialists in the [[Rhineland]] to raise money for Marx's publication efforts in Brussels.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 101.</ref> However, these contacts became more important as both Marx and Engels began political organizing for the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]].

=== Brussels ===
[[File:Belgique - Bruxelles - Grand-Place - Maison du Cygne - 01b.jpg|thumb|''La Maison du Cygne'' (the Swan Tavern), Brussels, where the [[Communist Manifesto]] was written<ref name="Thomson 2012 p.92">{{cite book | last=Thomson | first=Emma | title=Flanders : Northern Belgium : the Bradt travel guide | publisher=Bradt Travel Guides | publication-place=Chalfont St. Peter | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-84162-377-1 | oclc=810098009 | page=92}}</ref>]]
The nation of Belgium, founded in 1830, was endowed with one of the most liberal constitutions in Europe and functioned as refuge for progressives from other countries. From 1845 to 1848, Engels and Marx lived in [[Brussels]], spending much of their time organising the city's German workers. Shortly after their arrival, they contacted and joined the underground [[Communist League|German Communist League]]. The Communist League was the successor organisation to the old League of the Just which had been founded in 1837, but had recently disbanded.<ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford, England, 1963) pp. 159–160.</ref> Influenced by [[Wilhelm Weitling]], the Communist League was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various European cities.<ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' p. 160.</ref>

The Communist League also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]]. Many of Marx's and Engels's current friends became members of the Communist League. Old friends like [[Georg Herwegh|Georg Friedrich Herwegh]], who had worked with Marx on the ''Rheinsche Zeitung'', [[Heinrich Heine]], the famous poet, a young doctor by the name of Roland Daniels, [[Heinrich Burgers|Heinrich Bürgers]] and [[August Herman Ewerbeck]] all maintained their contacts with Marx and Engels in Brussels. [[Georg Weerth]], who had become a friend of Engels in England in 1843, now settled in Brussels. [[Karl Wallau]] and [[Stephen Born]] (real name [[Simon Buttermilch]]) were both German immigrant typesetters who settled in Brussels to help Marx and Engels with their Communist League work. Marx and Engels made many new important contacts through the Communist League. One of the first was [[Wilhelm Wolff]], who was soon to become one of Marx's and Engels's closest collaborators. Others were [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] and [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]], a famous revolutionary poet. While most of the associates of Marx and Engels were German immigrants living in Brussels, some of their new associates were Belgians. [[Phillipe Gigot]], a Belgian philosopher and [[Victor Tedesco]], a lawyer from Liège, both joined the Communist League. [[Joachim Lelewel]] a prominent Polish historian and participant in the Polish uprising of 1830–1831 was also a frequent associate.<ref>P.N. Fedoseyev ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 86–88.)</ref><ref>Gary Tedman, ''Aesthetics & Alienation'' (Zero Books: Hampshire, 1973)</ref>

The Communist League commissioned Marx and Engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism. This became ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', better known as the ''Communist Manifesto''.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'' contained in the ''Collected Works Volume 6'' pp. 477–517.</ref> It was first published on 21 February 1848 and ends with the world-famous phrase: "Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working Men of All Countries, Unite!"<ref name="engels-bio"/>

Engels's mother wrote in a letter to him of her concerns, commenting that he had "really gone too far" and "begged" him "to proceed no further".<ref name="mothersletter">Elisabeth Engels's letter contained at No. 6 of the Appendix, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'' (International Publishers: New York, 1982) pp. 540–541.</ref> She further stated:<blockquote>You have paid more heed to other people, to strangers, and have taken no account of your mother's pleas. God alone knows what I have felt and suffered of late. I was trembling when I picked up the newspaper and saw therein that a warrant was out for my son's arrest.<ref name="mothersletter"/></blockquote>

=== Return to Prussia ===
There was a [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution in France in 1848]] that [[Revolutions of 1848|soon spread to other Western European countries]]. These events caused Engels and Marx to return to their homeland of the Kingdom of Prussia, specifically to the city of [[Cologne]]. While living in Cologne, they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''.<ref name="en-1893" /> Besides Marx and Engels, other frequent contributors to the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' included [[Karl Schapper]], [[Wilhelm Wolff]], [[Ernst Dronke]], [[Peter Nothjung]], [[Heinrich Burgers|Heinrich Bürgers]], [[Ferdinand Wolf]] and Carl Cramer.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Banquet in Gűrzenich" contained in the ''Collected Works: Volume 9'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 490.</ref> Friedrich Engels's mother, herself, gives unwitting witness to the effect of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' on the revolutionary uprising in Cologne in 1848. Criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a 5 December 1848 letter to Friedrich that "nobody, ourselves included, doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke, and also the language of ''(Neue) Rh.Z.'' were largely the cause of these disturbances."<ref name=p543>Elisabeth Engels's letter to Friedrich Engels contained at No. 8 of the Appendix in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 543.</ref>

Engels's parents hoped that young Engels would "decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursuing in recent years and which have caused so much distress".<ref name=p543/> At this point, his parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to America and start his life over. They told him that he should do this or he would "cease to receive money from us".<ref name=p543/> However, the problem in the relationship between Engels and his parents was worked out without Engels having to leave England or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents. In July 1851, Engels's father arrived to visit him in Manchester, England. During the visit, his father arranged for Engels to meet Peter Ermen of the office of ''Ermen & Engels'', to move to Liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in Manchester.<ref>Friedrich Engels letter to Karl Marx dated 6 July 1851 and contained at No. 186 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 378.</ref>

In 1849, Engels travelled to the Kingdom of Bavaria for the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Baden and Palatinate revolutionary uprising]], an even more dangerous involvement. Starting with an article called "The Magyar Struggle", written on 8 January 1849, Engels, himself, began a series of reports on the Revolution and War for Independence of the newly founded Hungarian Republic.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "The Magyar Struggle" contained in ''Collected Works: Volume 8'', pp. 227–238.</ref> Engels's articles on the Hungarian Republic became a regular feature in the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' under the heading "From the Theatre of War".<ref>See Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 8'', pp. 451–480 and ''Volume 9'', pp. 9–463.</ref> However, the newspaper was suppressed during the June 1849 Prussian coup d'état. After the coup, Marx lost his Prussian [[citizenship]], was deported and fled to Paris and then London. Engels stayed in Prussia and took part in an armed uprising in South Germany as an [[aide-de-camp]] in the volunteer corps of [[August Willich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1892.htm |title=Engels, Friedrich (encyclopedia) |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'', 4th ed. 1978, New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 130, {{ISBN|978-0-19-510326-7}}.</ref><ref>Mike Rapport, ''1848 Year of Revolution'', London: Little Brown, 2008, p. 342, {{ISBN|978-0-316-72965-9}}.</ref> Engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in [[Elberfeld]] on 10 May 1849.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Elberfeld" contained in the ''Collected Works: Volume 9'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 447.</ref> Later when Prussian troops came to Kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there, Engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of August Willich, who were going to fight the Prussian troops.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild: Dresden, 1972) p. 205.</ref> When the uprising was crushed, Engels was one of the last members of Willich's volunteers to escape by crossing the Swiss border.

Engels travelled through [[Switzerland]] as a [[refugee]] and eventually made it to safety in England.<ref name="engels-bio" /> On 6 June 1849 Prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Engels which contained a physical description as "height: 5 feet 6 inches; hair: blond; forehead: smooth; eyebrows: blond; eyes: blue; nose and mouth: well proportioned; beard: reddish; chin: oval; face: oval; complexion: healthy; figure: slender. Special characteristics: speaks very rapidly and is short-sighted".<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 9'', p. 524,</ref> As to his "short-sightedness", Engels admitted as much in a letter written to Joseph Weydemeyer on 19 June 1851 in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the Prussian military because of "my eye trouble, as I have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort".<ref>Friedrich Engels letter contained at No. 183 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 370.</ref> Once he was safe in Switzerland, Engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the Prussians.

=== Back in Britain ===
[[File:Engel House in Primrose.jpg|thumb|Engels's house in [[Primrose Hill]], London]]
To help Marx with ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politische-okonomische Revue|Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-ökonomische Revue]]'', the new publishing effort in London, Engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to London. On 5 October 1849, Engels arrived in the Italian port city of Genoa.<ref>See the "Letter from Engels to George Julian Harney" dated 5 October 1849, in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'' p. 217.</ref> There, Engels booked passage on the English schooner, ''Cornish Diamond'' under the command of a Captain Stevens.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Letter from Engels to George Julian Harney (5 October 1849) ''Collected Works: Volume 38'' p. 217.</ref> The voyage across the western Mediterranean, around the Iberian Peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks. Finally, the ''Cornish Diamond'' sailed up the River Thames to London on 10 November 1849 with Engels on board.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 213.</ref>

Upon his return to Britain, Engels re-entered the Manchester company in which his father held shares in order to support Marx financially as he worked on ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml |title=Legacies – Engels in Manchester |page =4 |publisher=BBC |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_5.shtml |title=Legacies – Engels in Manchester|page =5 |publisher=BBC |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref> Unlike his first period in England (1843), Engels was now under police surveillance. He had "official" homes and "unofficial homes" all over Salford, Weaste and other inner-city Manchester districts where he lived with Mary Burns under false names to confuse the police.<ref name="salfordstar.com"/> Little more is known, as Engels destroyed over 1,500 letters between himself and Marx after the latter's death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle.<ref name="salfordstar.com" />

Despite his work at the mill, Engels found time to write a book on [[Martin Luther]], the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[German Peasants' War|1525 revolutionary war of the peasants]], entitled ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]''.<ref>"The Peasant War in Germany" and s contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' pp. 397–482.</ref> Engels also wrote a number of newspaper articles including "The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution" which he finished in February 1850<ref>The article called "The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' p. 147</ref> and "On the Slogan of the Abolition of the State and the German 'Friends of Anarchy'" written in October 1850.<ref>The article "On the Slogan of the Abolition of the State and the German 'Friends of Anarchy'" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels: Volume 10'' p. 486.</ref> In April 1851, he wrote the pamphlet "Conditions and Prospects of a War of the Holy Alliance against France".<ref>The pamphlet "Conditions and Prospects of a War of the Holy Alliance against France" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' p. 542.</ref>

Marx and Engels denounced [[Napoleon III|Louis Bonaparte]] when he carried out a coup against the French government and made himself president for life on 2 December 1851. In condemning this action, Engels wrote to Marx on 3 December 1851, characterising the coup as "comical"<ref name=letter1851>Friedrich Engels's letter to Karl Marx dated 3 December 1851 contained in the "Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38", p. 503.</ref> and referred to it as occurring on "the 18th Brumaire", the date of Napoleon I's coup of 1799 according to the [[French Republican Calendar]].<ref>See note 517 located at p. 635 in the "Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38.</ref> Marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of Louis Bonaparte's coup into his essay about the coup. Indeed, Marx even called the essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'' again using Engels's suggested characterisation.<ref>Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 11'', p. 98.</ref> Marx also borrowed Engels characterisation of Hegel's notion of the [[Geist#Hegel|World Spirit]] that history occurred twice, "once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce" in the first paragraph of his new essay.<ref>Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 11'', p. 103.</ref>

Meanwhile, Engels started working at the mill owned by his father in Manchester as an office clerk, the same position he held in his teens while in Germany where his father's company was based. Engels worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in 1864.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Five years later, Engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies.<ref name="en-1893"/> At this time, Marx was living in London but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence. One of the ideas that Engels and Marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the Russias. As early as April 1853, Engels and Marx anticipated an "aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia which would begin in "St. Petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior".<ref>Letter from Engels to Joseph Weydemeyer dated 12 April 1853, contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 39'' (New York: International Publishers, 1983) pp. 305–306.</ref> The model for this type of aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia against the autocratic [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist government]] in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the [[Decembrist Revolt]] of 1825.<ref>W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs: Autocrats of All the Russias'' (New York: Dial Press, 1981) pp. 408–413.</ref>

Although an unsuccessful revolt against the Tsarist government in favour of a constitutional government, both Engels and Marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in Russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in Russian development to precede a communist stage. By 1881, both Marx and Engels began to contemplate a course of development in Russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage. This analysis was based on what Marx and Engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the Russian village commune or [[obshchina]].<ref>See the letter from Karl Marx to Vera Zasulich contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 46'', (New York: International Press, 1992), pp. 71–72, and Engels's "Preface to the Russian Edition of 1882" in ''The Communist Manifesto''.</ref> While doubt was cast on this theory by [[Georgi Plekhanov]], Plekhanov's reasoning was based on the first edition of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867) which predated Marx's interest in Russian peasant communes by two years. Later editions of the text demonstrate Marx's sympathy for the argument of [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], that it should be possible to establish socialism in Russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition.<ref>Gareth Stedman Jones, note on Engels's "Preface to the Russian Edition of 1882" in ''The Communist Manifesto'' (London: Penguin Books, 2002).</ref>

In 1870, Engels moved to London where he and Marx lived until Marx's death in 1883.<ref name="engels-bio" /> Engels's London home from 1870 to 1894 was at 122 Regent's Park Road.<ref>{{openplaque|213}} – Accessed July 2010</ref> In October 1894 he moved to 41 Regent's Park Road, [[Primrose Hill]], NW1, where he died the following year.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Marx's first London residence was a cramped apartment at 28 [[Dean Street]], [[Soho]]. From 1856, he lived at 9 Grafton Terrace, [[Kentish Town]], and then in a tenement at 41 Maitland Park Road in [[Belsize Park]] from 1875 until his death in March 1883.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/photo/places/index.htm |title=Photos of Marx's Residence(s) |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref>

Mary Burns suddenly died of a heart disease in 1863, after which Engels became close with her younger sister Lydia ("[[Lizzie Burns|Lizzie]]"). They lived openly as a couple in London and married on 11 September 1878, hours before Lizzie's death.<ref name=b1>{{cite book|author=Henderson, William Otto |title=The Life of Friedrich Engels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teYf8gwzoB4C&pg=PA567|year=1976|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-3040-3|page=567}}</ref><ref name=b2>{{cite book|author=Samuel Hollander|title=Friedrich Engels and Marxian Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIn_Sa2wdx0C&pg=PA358|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49844-9|page=358}}</ref>

=== Later years ===
Later in their life, both Marx and Engels came to argue that in some countries workers might be able to achieve their aims through peaceful means.<ref>Gray, Daniel; Johnson, Elliott; Walker, David (2014).

Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield. pp. 119–120. {{ISBN|9781442237988}}.</ref> In following this, Engels argued that socialists were evolutionists, although they remained committed to [[social revolution]].<ref>Steger, Manfred B.

University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University. pp. 181–196. {{ISBN|9780271018911}}.</ref> Similarly, [[Tristram Hunt]] argues that Engels was sceptical of "top-down revolutions" and later in life advocated "a peaceful, democratic road to socialism".<ref name="NYT"/> Engels also wrote in his introduction to the 1891 edition of Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France]]'' that "[r]ebellion in the old style, street fighting with barricades, which decided the issue everywhere up to 1848, was to a considerable extent obsolete",<ref name="Kellogg 1991">Kellogg, Paul (Summer 1991).

Lowell empashised their cautionary and tactical meaning, arguing that "Engels questions only rebellion 'in the old style', that is, insurrection: he does not renounce revolution. The reason for Engels' caution is clear: he candidly admits that ultimate victory for any insurrection is rare, simply on military and tactical grounds".<ref>Lowell, David W. (1984). ''From Marx to Lenin: An Evaluation of Marx's Responsibility for Soviet Authoritarianism'' (reprinted ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 83. {{ISBN|9780521261883}}.</ref>

In his introduction to the 1895 edition of Marx's ''The Class Struggles in France'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between [[reformists]] and [[revolutionaries]] in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included [[gradualist]] and [[evolutionary socialist]] measures while maintaining his belief that revolutionary seizure of power by the proletariat should remain a goal. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the revisionists.<ref name="Steger 1999">Steger, Manfred B. (1999). "Friedrich Engels and the Origins of German Revisionism: Another Look". In Carver, Terrell; Steger, Manfred B. (eds.). ''Engels After Marx''. University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University. p. 182. {{ISBN|9780271018911}}.</ref> Engels's statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'', in which he wrote that "revolution" and the "so-called socialist society" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena, and argued that this made "us socialists all evolutionists", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also argued that it would be "suicidal" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power that he predicted could bring "[[social democracy]] into power as early as 1898". Engels's stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion. [[Marxist revisionist]] [[Eduard Bernstein]] interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels's stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances and that Engels was still committed to [[revolutionary socialism]].<ref>Steger, Manfred B. (1999). "Friedrich Engels and the Origins of German Revisionism: Another Look". In Carver, Terrell; Steger, Manfred B. (eds.). ''Engels After Marx''. University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University. p. 186. {{ISBN|9780271018911}}.</ref> Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[orthodox Marxist]] [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.<ref name="Steger 1999"/> On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels responded to Kautsky:
<blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorwärts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs]. Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what's more, without so much as a word to me about it.<ref>Engels, Friedrich (2004). ''Collected Works''. '''50'''. New York: International Publishers. p. 86.</ref></blockquote>

After Marx's death, Engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing Marx's unfinished volumes of ''[[Das Kapital]]''. However, he also contributed significantly in other areas. Engels made an argument using [[anthropological]] evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history, and that the concept of [[monogamous]] marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property. He argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints. One of the best examples of Engels's thoughts on these issues are in his work ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''. On 5 August 1895, Engels died of throat cancer in London, aged 74.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbU5AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT365 |title=Love and Capital: Karl and Jenny Marx and the Birth of a Revolution| first=Mary |last=Gabriel |date=14 September 2011 |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=9780316191371|via=Google Books |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="Marx-Engels_Correspondence_1895">{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1895/letters/95_05_21.htm |title=Letters: Marx-Engels Correspondence 1895 |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref> Following cremation at [[Woking Crematorium]], his ashes were scattered off [[Beachy Head]], near [[Eastbourne]], as he had requested.<ref name="Marx-Engels_Correspondence_1895"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kerrigan |first=Michael |title=Who Lies Where – A guide to famous graves |year=1998 |publisher=Fourth Estate Limited |location=London |isbn=978-1-85702-258-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wholieswhereguid00kerr/page/156 156] |url=https://archive.org/details/wholieswhereguid00kerr/page/156 }}</ref> He left a considerable estate to [[Eduard Bernstein]] and Louise Freyberger (wife of [[:de:Ludwig Freyberger|Ludwig Freyberger]]), valued for probate at £25,265 0s. 11d, equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|25265.045833|1895|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref name="probate">{{cite web |url=https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk |title=Engels, Frederick|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1895 |website=probatesearchservice.gov |publisher=UK Government |access-date=14 June 2020}}</ref>

Engels's interests included poetry, [[fox hunting]] and hosting regular Sunday parties for London's left-wing [[intelligentsia]] where, as one regular put it, "no one left before two or three in the morning". His stated personal motto was "take it easy" while "jollity" was listed as his favourite virtue.<ref>{{cite web|last=Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1868/04/01.htm |title=Friedrich Engels's "Confession" |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=25 October 2014 |first=Friedrich |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427034624/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1868/04/01.htm |archive-date=27 April 2014 }}</ref>

Of Engels's personality and appearance, [[Robert Heilbroner]] described him in ''The Worldly Philosophers'' as "tall and rather elegant, he had the figure of a man who liked to fence and to ride to hounds and who had once swum the Weser River four times without a break" as well as having been "gifted with a quick wit and facile mind" and of a gay temperament, being able to "stutter in twenty languages". He had a great enjoyment of wine and other "bourgeois pleasures". Engels favoured forming romantic relationships with that of the proletariat and found a long-term partner in a working-class woman named [[Mary Burns]], although they never married. After her death, Engels was romantically involved with her younger sister [[Lydia Burns]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Robert L.heilbroner|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.223866|title=The Worldly Philosophers (the Great Economic Thinkers)|date=1953}}</ref>

Historian and former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Tristram Hunt]], author of ''The Frock-Coated Communist: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels'',<ref name="Hunt_2009"/> argues that Engels "almost certainly was, in other words, the kind of man Stalin would have had shot".<ref name="NYT"/> Hunt sums up the disconnect between Engels's personality and the Soviet Union which later utilised his works, stating:
{{quote|This great lover of the good life, passionate advocate of individuality, and enthusiastic believer in literature, culture, art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the Soviet Communism of the 20th century, all the Stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding.<ref name="Hunt_2009"/><ref name="NYT"/>}}

As to the religious persuasion attributable to Engels, Hunt writes:
{{quote|In that sense the latent rationality of Christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family, civil society, and the state. What Engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern [[pantheism]], or, rather, [[pandeism]], a merging of divinity with progressing humanity, a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement. 'Through [[David Strauss|Strauss]] I have now entered on the straight road to Hegelianism... The Hegelian idea of God has already become mine, and thus I am joining the ranks of the "modern pantheists",' Engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soon-to-be-discarded Graebers [Wilhelm and Friedrich, priest trainees and former classmates of Engels].<ref name="Hunt_2009"/>}}

Engels was a [[polyglot]] and was able to write and speak in numerous languages, including Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Irish, Spanish, Polish, French, English and [[Milanese dialect]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Friedrich Engels|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1905/08/engels.htm|work=Marxists Internet Archive (from The Social Democrat journal)|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|access-date=15 April 2013|author=Paul Lafargue|author2=Jacques Bonhomme |date=15 August 1905}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
{{Marxism}}
In his biography of Engels, [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote: "After his friend Karl Marx (who died in 1883), Engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world. [...] In their scientific works, Marx and Engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers, but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society. All recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle, of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others."<ref>{{cite web |author= Vladimir Ilyich Lenin |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1895/misc/engels-bio.htm|title=Friedrich Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=25 January 2011}}</ref> According to [[Paul Kellogg]], there is "some considereble controversy" regarding "the place of Frederick Engels in the canon of '[[classical Marxism]]'". While some such as [[Terrell Carver]] dispute "Engels' claim that Marx agreed with the views put forward in Engels' major theoretical work, ''Anti-Dühring''", others such as [[E. P. Thompson]] "identified a tendency to make 'old Engels into a whipping boy, and to impugn him any sign that once chooses to impugn subsequent Marxsisms'".<ref name="Kellogg 1991"/>

[[Tristram Hunt]] argues that Engels has become a convenient [[scapegoat]], too easily blamed for the state crimes of [[Communist regime]]s such as China, the [[Soviet Union]] and those in Africa and Southeast Asia, among others. Hunt writes that "Engels is left holding the bag of 20th century ideological extremism" while [[Karl Marx]] "is rebranded as the acceptable, post–political seer of [[global capitalism]]".<ref name="NYT"/> Hunt largely exonerates Engels, stating that "[i]n no intelligible sense can Engels or Marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later, even if the policies were offered up in their honor".<ref name="NYT"/> Andrew Lipow describes Marx and Engels as "the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism".<ref>Lipow, Arthur (1991). ''Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement''. University of California Press. p. 1. {{ISBN|9780520075436}}. "We are not among those communists who are out to destroy personal liberty, who wish to turn the world into one huge barrack or into a gigantic workhouse. There certainly are some communists who, with an easy conscience, refuse to countenance personal liberty and would like to shuffle it out of the world because they consider that it is a hindrance to complete harmony. But we have no desire to exchange freedom for equality. We are convinced that in no social order will freedom be assured as in a society based upon communal ownership. Thus wrote the editors of the ''Journal'' of the Communist League in 1847, under the direct influence of the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels."</ref>

While admitting the distance between Marx and Engels on one hand and [[Joseph Stalin]] on the other, some writers such as [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] are less charitable, noting that the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas, arguing that "[i]t is a fallacy that Marxism's flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power. [...] [Marx and Engels] were centralisers. While talking about 'free associations of producers', they advocated discipline and hierarchy".<ref>Robert Service (2007). ''Comrades: A World History of Communism''. London: Macmillan. p. 37</ref> Paul Thomas, of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], claims that while Engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of Marx's writings, he significantly altered Marx's intents as he held, edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them. Engels attempted to fill gaps in Marx's system and extend it to other fields. In particular, Engels is said to have stressed [[historical materialism]], assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine, forming [[Marxism]] as such. A case in point is ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' which both supporters and detractors of socialism treated as an encompassing presentation of Marx's thought. While in his extensive correspondence with German socialists Engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couple's intellectual relationship and always emphasised Marx's outstanding role, Russian communists such as Lenin raised Engels up with Marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous. Soviet Marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of [[dialectical materialism]].<ref>{{citation | last = Thomas | first = Paul | contribution = Critical Reception: Marx then and now | pages = 36–42 | title = The Cambridge Companion to Marx | editor-last = Carver | editor-first = Terrell | editor-link = Terrell Carver | year = 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}<!--He cites Carver 1981 a lot, and Hobsbawm (ed) 1982 "History of Marxism", more on contextual points.--></ref>

Since 1931, Engels has had a Russian city named after him—[[Engels, Saratov Oblast]]. It served as the capital of the [[Volga German Republic]] within [[Soviet Russia]] and as part of [[Saratov Oblast]]. A town named [[Marks, Russia|Marx]] is located {{convert|30|miles|km|-1|order=flip|abbr=off}} northeast. In 2014, Engels's "magnificent beard" inspired a [[climbing wall]] sculpture in Salford. The {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|0|order=flip}} beard statue, described as a "symbol of wisdom and learning", was planned to stand on the campus of the [[University of Salford]]. Engine, the arts company behind the piece, stated that "the idea came from a 1980s plan to relocate an Eastern Bloc statue of the thinker to Manchester".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-30375063 |title=Friedrich Engels' beard inspires climbing sculpture in Salford |date=9 December 2014 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2017}}</ref>

In the summer of 2017, as part of the [[Manchester International Festival]], a Soviet-era statue of Engels was installed by sculptor Phil Collins at Tony Wilson Place in [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite news|date=14 July 2017|title=Watch as Friedrich Engels statue is put together in Manchester city centre|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/watch-friedrich-engels-statue-put-13331317|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref>  It was transported from the village of Mala Pereshchepina in [[Eastern Ukraine]], after the statue had been deposed from its central position in the village in the wake [[Ukrainian decommunization laws|of laws outlawing communist symbols in Ukraine]] introduced in 2015. In recognition of the important influence Manchester had on his work, the 3.5 metre statue now stands in Tony Wilson Place, a prominent eatery district on Manchester's [[First Street, Manchester|First Street]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-07-23|title=Spotlight on Statues: Friedrich Engels, First Street|url=https://www.manchestersfinest.com/uncategorized/spotlight-statues-friedrich-engels-first-street/|access-date=2021-08-23|website=Manchester’s Finest|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-06-30|title=Phil Collins: why I took a Soviet statue of Engels across Europe to Manchester|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/30/phil-collins-why-i-took-a-soviet-statue-of-engels-across-europe-to-manchester|access-date=2021-08-23|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> The installation of what was originally an instrument of propaganda drew criticism from Kevin Bolton in ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Kevin|date=19 July 2017|title=Manchester has a Soviet statue of Engels.

The [[Friedrich Engels Guards Regiment]] (also known as NVA Guard Regiment 1) was a [[Honor guard|special guard unit]] of the [[East German]] [[National People's Army]] (NVA). The guard regiment was established in 1962 from parts of the [[Hugo Eberlein Guards Regiment]] but wasn't given the title "Friedrich Engels" until 1970.[[File:Nva-ehrenwache.jpg|thumb|NVA Honor Guard, East Berlin, 1990{{Clarify|reason=Are they doing a honor march for Engels?|date=September 2021}}]]

=== Influences ===
In spite of his criticism of the [[utopian socialists]], Engels's own beliefs were nonetheless influenced by the French socialist [[Charles Fourier]]. From Fourier, he derives four main points that characterize the social conditions of a communist state. The first point maintains that every individual would be able to fully develop their talents by eliminating the specialization of production. Without specialization, every individual would be permitted to exercise any vocation of their choosing for as long or as little as they would like. If talents permitted it, one could be a baker for a year and an engineer the next. The second point builds upon the first as with the ability of workers to cycle through different jobs of their choosing, the fundamental basis of the social division of labour is destroyed and the social division of labour will disappear as a result. If anyone can employ himself at any job that he wishes, then there are clearly no longer any divisions or barriers to entry for labour, otherwise such fluidity between entirely different jobs would not exist. The third point continues from the second as once the social division of labour is gone, the division of social classes based on property ownership will fade with it. If labour division puts a man in charge of a farm, that farmer owns the productive resources of that farm. The same applies to the ownership of a factory or a bank. Without labour division, no single social class may claim exclusive rights to a particular means of production since the absence of labour division allows all to use it. Finally, the fourth point concludes that the elimination of social classes destroys the sole purpose of the state and it will cease to exist. As Engels stated in his own writing, the only purpose of the state is to abate the effects of class antagonisms. With the elimination of social classes based on property, the state becomes obsolete and a communist society, at least in the eyes of Engels, is achieved.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levine |first1=Norman |title=Lenin's Utopianism |journal=Studies in Soviet Thought |date=August 1985 |volume=30 |issue= 2 |pages=101–102 |doi=10.1007/BF01043754 |jstor=20100033 |s2cid=144891961 }}</ref>

== Major works ==
=== ''The Holy Family'' (1844) ===
[[File:OriginOfFamily-1884.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of Engels's ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'', first published in 1884]]
{{main article|The Holy Family (book)}}
This book was written by Marx and Engels in November 1844. It is a critique on the [[Young Hegelians]] and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time. The title was suggested by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] Brothers and their supporters.<ref name="holy-family">{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm |title=The Holy Family by Marx and Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref>

The book created a controversy with much of the [[Print media|press]] and caused [[Bruno Bauer]] to attempt to refute the book in an article published in {{ill|Wigand's|de|Otto Wigand}} ''Vierteljahrsschrift'' in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was trying to say. Marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal ''{{ill|Gesellschaftsspiegel|de}}'' in January 1846. Marx also discussed the argument in chapter 2 of ''[[The German Ideology]]''.<ref name="holy-family"/>

=== ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' (1845) ===
{{main article|The Condition of the Working Class in England}}
A study of the deprived conditions of the working class in Manchester and Salford, based on Engels's personal observations. The work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development. Originally published in German and only translated into English in 1887, the work initially had little impact in England. It was however very influential with historians of British industrialisation throughout the twentieth century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=The 'industrial revolution': interpretations from 1830 to the present|url=https://www.academia.edu/1843995|access-date=9 March 2013}}</ref>

=== ''The Peasant War in Germany'' (1850) ===
{{main article|The Peasant War in Germany}}
An account of the early 16th-century uprising known as the [[German Peasants' War]], with a comparison with the recent revolutionary uprisings of 1848–1849 across Europe.<ref>''The Peasant War in Germany,'' trans. Moissaye J. Olgin (New York: International Publishers, 1966).</ref>

=== ''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' (1878) ===
{{main article|Anti-Dühring}}
Popularly known as ''Anti-Dühring'', this book is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of [[Eugen Dühring]], a German philosopher and critic of Marxism. In the course of replying to Dühring, Engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena. Many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work, ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]''. Three chapters of ''Anti-Dühring'' were later edited and published under the separate title, ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific''.

=== ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' (1880) ===
{{main article|Socialism: Utopian and Scientific}}
One of the best selling socialist books of the era.<ref>{{cite book | quote = From this French text, a Polish and a Spanish edition were prepared. In 1883, our German friends brought out the pamphlet in the original language. Italian, Russian, Danish, Dutch, and Roumanian translations, based upon the German text, have since been published. Thus, the present English edition, this little book circulates in 10 languages. I am not aware that any other Socialist work, not even our Communist Manifesto of 1848, or Marx's Capital, has been so often translated. In Germany, it has had four editions of about 20,000 copies in all. | last = Engels | first = Friedrich | orig-year = 1892 | chapter = Introduction | title = Socialism: Utopian and Scientific | chapter-url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm | publisher = Progress Publishers | year = 1970 | series = Marx/Engels Selected Works | volume = 3}}<!--alternate editions at https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%28Socialism%20Utopian%20and%20Scientific%29--> Cited in {{cite book | last= Carver | first = Terrell | author-link= Terrell Carver | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | title = Engels: A Very Short Introduction | url= https://archive.org/details/engelsveryshorti00carv_145 | url-access= limited | page = [https://archive.org/details/engelsveryshorti00carv_145/page/n70 56]| isbn = 978-0-19-280466-2 }} and {{citation | last = Thomas | first = Paul | contribution = Critical Reception: Marx then and now | title = The Cambridge Companion to Marx | editor-last = Carver | editor-first = Terrell | year = 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}</ref> In this work, Engels briefly described and analyzed the ideas of notable utopian socialists such as [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], pointed out their strongpoints and shortcomings, and provides an explanation of the scientific socialist framework for understanding of capitalism, and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of [[historical materialism]].

=== ''Dialectics of Nature'' (1883) ===
{{main article|Dialectics of Nature}}
''Dialectics of Nature'' (German: "Dialektik der Natur") is an unfinished 1883 work by Engels that applies Marxist ideas, particularly those of dialectical materialism, to science. It was first published in the Soviet Union in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1883/don/|title=1883-Dialectics of Nature-Index|last=Engels|website=marxists.anu.edu.au|access-date=4 May 2018}}</ref>

=== ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State'' (1884) ===
{{main article|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State}}
In this work, Engels argues that the family is an ever-changing institution that has been shaped by capitalism. It contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class, female subjugation and [[private property]].
