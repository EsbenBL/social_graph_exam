==Life and times==
Argumedo was born in [[Rosario]] in 1940. She enrolled at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and earned a degree in [[Sociology]] in 1965. She taught at her alma mater's School of Philosophy and Letters between 1968 and 1974, and served as Secretary of Culture by [[Buenos Aires Province]] Governor [[Oscar Bidegain]] during his brief 1973-74 tenure. She continued to teach, and wrote numerous treatises on the impact of [[globalization]] in the [[Third World]] during the early 1970s.<ref name=cv>{{cite web|url=http://alciraargumedo.com/?page_id=2|title=Curriculum|publisher=Alicia Argumedo|access-date=23 June 2011|archive-date=25 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425174821/http://alciraargumedo.com/?page_id=2|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[March 1976 coup]] and the subsequent [[Dirty War]] compelled Argumedo to leave Argentina in 1978, and she sought exile in [[Mexico]]. She worked in the Latin American Institute of Transnational Studies (ILET), published numerous articles for IPECAL, and served as adviser to [[Gabriel García Márquez]] and [[Juan Somavía]] in a discussion regarding [[New World Information and Communication Order]] hosted by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=cv/>
