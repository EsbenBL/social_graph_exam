'''Robert Sugden''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 26 August 1949) is an English author in the area of cognitive and [[behavioural economics]]. Professor Sugden's research combines [[game theory]] (mainly experimental game theory and coordination games) with moral and [[political philosophy]]. He is associated with the classical-liberal tradition of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], and [[Friedrich August von Hayek|Hayek]].

== Theory ==
In his most cited work, Sugden explored how conventions of property, mutual aid, and voluntary supply of public goods can evolve spontaneously out of the interactions of self-interested individuals and can become moral norms.<ref>R Sugden, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0333682394 ''The economics of rights, co-operation, and welfare''] (1986)</ref>

Sugden investigated a number of violations of the [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]]'s [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] axioms, and developed [[Regret (decision theory)|regret theory]] as an alternative with [[Graham Loomes]]. In support of this work, he developed a number of experimental methods to test theories of decision under risk.<ref>G Loomes and R Sugden, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2232669 Regret theory: An alternative theory of rational choice under uncertainty] (1982), The Economic Journal</ref>

His work also deals with economic methods, in which he argues that economic models are not abstractions from, or simplifications of, the real world, but rather descriptions of imaginary worlds whose validity can only be inferred by how reasonable their predictions are.<ref>R Sugden, [http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&issn=1350-178X&volume=7&issue=1&spage=1 Credible worlds: the status of theoretical models in economics] (2000), Journal of Economic Methodology
</ref>

In ''The Community of Advantage'', Sugden develops a contractarian approach to welfare economics that is based on opportunity sets and not individual preferences.<ref>R Sugden, [https://www.amazon.com/Community-Advantage-Behavioural-Economists-Defence/dp/0198825145 The community of advantage: A behavioural economist's defense of the market] (2018)</ref>  The shift from preferences to opportunity is partly motivated by recent experimental work indicating that individuals lack well-defined preferences.  In 2019, ''The Community of Advantage'' was awarded the Joseph B. Gittler Award for outstanding contribution in the field of the philosophy of the social sciences.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joseph B.
