Born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], Summers became a professor of economics at [[Harvard University]] in 1983. He left Harvard in 1991, working as the Vice President of Development Economics and Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993.<ref name="chief_economists_world_bank">[http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/0,,contentMDK:20437078~menuPK:4319683~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469372,00.html#summers "Former Chief Economists"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104225502/http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/0,,contentMDK:20437078~menuPK:4319683~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469372,00.html#summers |date=November 4, 2017 }}, Data & Research office, The World Bank, retrieved March 31, 2017</ref><ref name="lawrence_h_summers_world_bank_live">[http://live.worldbank.org/experts/lawrence-h-summers "Lawrence H.

He was also influential in the [[Harvard Institute for International Development]] and American-advised privatization of the economies of the [[post-Soviet states]], and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the [[Glass-Steagall Act]].

Following the end of Clinton's term, Summers served as the 27th [[President of Harvard University]] from 2001 to 2006. Summers resigned as Harvard's president in the wake of a [[no-confidence]] vote by Harvard faculty, which resulted in large part from Summers's conflict with [[Cornel West]], financial [[conflict of interest]] questions regarding his relationship with [[Andrei Shleifer]], and a 2005 speech in which he suggested that the under-representation of women in science and engineering could be due to a "different availability of [[aptitude]] at the high end", and less to patterns of discrimination and socialization.

After his departure from Harvard, Summers worked as a managing partner at the hedge fund [[D. E. Shaw & Co.]], and as a freelance speaker at other financial institutions, including [[Goldman Sachs]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Citigroup]], [[Merrill Lynch]] and [[Lehman Brothers]]. Summers rejoined public service during the [[Obama administration]], serving as the Director of the White House [[National Economic Council (United States)|United States National Economic Council]] for President [[Barack Obama]] from January 2009 until November 2010, where he emerged as a key economic decision-maker in the Obama administration's response to the [[Great Recession]].<ref name="lawrence_h_summers_world_bank_live" /><ref name="lawrence_h_summers_harvard_kennedy" /> After his departure from the NEC in December 2010, Summers worked in the private sector and as a columnist in major newspapers. In mid-2013, his name was widely floated as the potential successor to [[Ben Bernanke]] as the [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]], though Obama eventually nominated Federal Reserve Vice-Chairwoman [[Janet Yellen]] for the position. As of 2017, Summers retains his Harvard University status as former president emeritus and [[Charles W. Eliot]] University Professor. He also regularly writes opinion columns for ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lawrence H. Summers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/lawrence-summers/|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Washington Post|language=en}}</ref>

==Family and education==
Summers was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], on November 30, 1954, into a [[Jewish family]], the son of two economists, [[Robert Summers]] (who changed the family surname from Samuelson) and [[Anita Summers]] (of [[Romanian Jews|Romanian-Jewish]] ancestry), who are both professors at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He is also the nephew of two [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel laureates in economics]]: [[Paul Samuelson]] (brother of Robert Summers) and [[Kenneth Arrow]] (brother of Anita Arrow Summers).  He spent most of his childhood in [[Penn Valley, Pennsylvania|Penn Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]], where he attended [[Harriton High School]].

At age 16,<ref>Plotz, David.[http://www.slate.com/id/111151/ "Larry Summers: How the Great Brain learned to grin and bear it."], ''Slate'', June 29, 2001.</ref> he entered [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he originally intended to study [[physics]] but soon switched to [[economics]] ([[Bachelor of Science|S.B.]], 1975). He was also an active member of the MIT debating team and qualified for participation in the annual [[National Debate Tournament]] three times. He attended [[Harvard University]] as a graduate student ([[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], 1982).<ref name="thesis-summers-1982">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/303216376/ |title=An asset price approach to the analysis of capital income taxation |date=1982 |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Summers |first=Lawrence Henry |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription |oclc=9526217}}</ref> In 1983, at age 28, Summers became one of the youngest tenured professors in Harvard's history. It was also during this time that Summers was diagnosed with [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He underwent treatment and has since remained cancer-free. He was a visiting academic at the [[London School of Economics]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama's LSE alumni|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/ObamasLSEalumni.aspx|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|access-date=4 January 2014}}</ref> in 1987.

==Career==

===Academic economist===
[[File:Lawrence Summers, 1990.jpg|thumb|Summers in 1990]]
As a researcher, Summers has made important contributions in many areas of economics, primarily [[public finance]], [[labor economics]], [[financial economics]], and [[macroeconomics]]. Summers has also worked in international economics, economic demography, [[economic history]] and [[development economics]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poterba|first=James M.|date=Winter 1995|title=In Honor of Lawrence H.

Waterman Award]] from the [[National Science Foundation]]. Summers is also a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. Some of his popular courses today, as Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard University, include American Economic Policy and The Political Economy of Globalization.<ref>https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/lawrence-h-summers</ref>

===Public official===
Summers was on the staff of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] under President Reagan in 1982–1983. He also served as an economic adviser to the [[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]] Presidential campaign in 1988.

===Chief Economist at the World Bank===
Summers left Harvard in 1991 and served as [[World Bank Vice President of Development Economics|Vice President of Development Economics]] and [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist]] for the [[World Bank]] until 1993.<ref name="chief_economists_world_bank" /><ref name="lawrence_h_summers_world_bank_live" /><ref name="lawrence_h_summers_harvard_kennedy" />

According to the World Bank's Data & Research office (March, 2017), Summers returned to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1991 as the World Bank's Vice President of Development Economics and Chief Economist. As such, Summers played a "key role" in designing strategies to aid developing countries, worked on the bank's loan committee, guided the bank's research and statistics operations, and guided external training programs.<ref name="chief_economists_world_bank" />

The World Bank's official site also reports that Summer's research included an "influential" report that demonstrated a very high return from investments in educating girls in developing nations.<ref name="chief_economists_world_bank" />

According to ''The Economist,'' Summers was "often at the centre of heated debates" about economic policy, to an extent exceptional for the history of the World Bank in recent decades.<ref name="world_bank_contrarian">[https://www.economist.com/news/21702339-paul-romer-banks-new-chief-economist-world-bank-hires-famous-contrarian "New ideas: The World Bank hires a famous contrarian,"] July 18, 2016, ''The Economist,'' retrieved March 31, 2017</ref>

===="Dirty industries" controversy====
{{Further|Summers memo}}
In December 1991, while at the World Bank, Summers signed [[Summers memo|a memo]] that was leaked to the press. [[Lant Pritchett]] has claimed authorship of the private memo, which both he and Summers say was intended as sarcasm.<ref name="furor_on_memo_1992_02_07_ny_times">[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/07/business/furor-on-memo-at-world-bank.html "Furor on Memo At World Bank,"] February 7, 1992, ''The New York Times,'' retrieved March 30, 2017</ref> The memo stated that "the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.<ref name="furor_on_memo_1992_02_07_ny_times"/> ...

===Service in the Clinton Administration===
[[File:Lawrence Summers Treasury portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Summers as United States Secretary of the Treasury]]
In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs and later in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] under the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor [[Robert Rubin]]. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]].

Much of Summers's tenure at the Treasury Department was focused on international economic issues. He was deeply involved in the Clinton administration's effort to bail out Mexico and Russia when those nations had currency crises.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/13/business/a-new-economic-team-the-nominee-the-administration-s-fiscal-closer.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all A New Economic Team: The Nominee; The Administration's Fiscal Closer]. The New York Times. May 13, 1999.</ref>
Summers set up a project through which the [[Harvard Institute for International Development]] provided advice to the Russian government between 1992 and 1997. Later there was a scandal when it emerged that some of the Harvard project members had invested in Russia, and were therefore not impartial advisors.<ref name="Sergi2009">{{cite book

Summers encouraged then-Russian leader Boris Yeltsin to use the same "three-'ations'" of policy he advocated in the Clinton Administration – "privatization, stabilization, and liberalization."<ref>Naomi Klein, "The Shock Doctrine", p. 231</ref>

Summers pressured the Korean government to raise its interest rates and balance its budget in the midst of a recession, policies criticized by [[Paul Krugman]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Blustein|title=The Chastening|url=http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=9781586481810|publisher=Public Affairs, New York|year=2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208005946/http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=9781586481810|archive-date=December 8, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}
</ref> According to the book ''The Chastening'', by Paul Blustein, during this crisis, Summers, along with [[Paul Wolfowitz]], pushed for regime change in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Blustein|title=The Chastening|url=http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=9781586481810|page=232|publisher=Public Affairs, New York|year=2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208005946/http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=9781586481810|archive-date=December 8, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}

Summers was a leading voice within the Clinton Administration arguing against American leadership in [[greenhouse gas]] reductions and against US participation in the [[Kyoto Protocol]], according to internal documents made public in 2009.<ref name="nsarchive-ebb303">{{cite news |first=Robert|last=Wampler|title=Kyoto Redux?

As Treasury Secretary, Summers led the Clinton Administration's opposition to tax cuts proposed by the Republican Congress in 1999.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/budget/stories/taxes072699.htm Aides Say Clinton Would Veto Tax Compromise]. The Washington Post. July 26, 1999.</ref>

During the California [[energy crisis]] of 2000, then-Treasury Secretary Summers teamed with [[Alan Greenspan]] and [[Enron]] executive [[Kenneth Lay]] to lecture California Governor [[Gray Davis]] on the causes of the crisis, explaining that the problem was excessive government regulation.<ref name="Krugman">{{cite news |first=Paul|last=Krugman|author-link=Paul Krugman|title=California Energy Memories|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/california-energy-memories/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 2008|access-date=April 4, 2010}}

Summers hailed the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] in 1999, which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering [[commercial banking]], insurance, and investment services (by repealing key provisions in the 1933 [[Glass–Steagall Act]]): "Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the [[Great Depression]] and replace them with a system for the 21st century," Summers said.<ref name="NYTrepeal">{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/business/congress-passes-wide-ranging-bill-easing-bank-laws.html|title=Congress Passes Wide Ranging Law Repealing Bank laws|date=November 5, 1999|access-date=March 25, 2009|first=Stephen|last=Labaton}}</ref> "This historic legislation will better enable American companies to compete in the new economy."<ref name="NYTrepeal"/> Many critics, including [[POTUS|President]] [[Barack Obama]], have suggested the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]] was caused by the partial repeal of the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act.<ref name="WSJquestions">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123665023774979341|title=Ten Questions for Those Fixing the Financial Mess|work=Wall Street Journal|date=March 10, 2009|access-date=March 26, 2009|first=Damian|last=Paletta}}</ref> Indeed, as a member of President Clinton's [[Working Group on Financial Markets]], Summers, along with U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) Chairman [[Arthur Levitt]], Fed Chairman Greenspan, and Secretary Rubin, torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in Fall 2008.<ref name="Frontline">{{cite news|work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]/PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/warning/view/#morelink|title=the warning|date=October 23, 2009|access-date=October 26, 2009}}</ref>

====Views on banking regulation====
On May 7, 1998, the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) issued a Concept Release soliciting input from regulators, academics,
and practitioners to determine "how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without

At the time Summers stated that "to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional regulation of the institutional OTC derivatives market, and we would submit that proponents of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need."<ref>{{cite news|last=Summers|first=Lawrence|title=Lawrence H.

In 1999 Summers endorsed the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act which removed the separation between investment and commercial banks, saying "With this bill, the American financial system takes a major step forward towards the 21st Century."<ref><!-- David Orrell's 2010 book Economyths, page 142–143 -->{{cite book |pages=142–143|lccn=2011286013|author-link=David Orrell|last=Orrell|first=David | title-link=Economyths|title=Economyths : ten ways economics gets it wrong|location=[[Mississauga, Ontario]]|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons Canada, Ltd]]|year=2010|isbn=9780470677933}}</ref>

When [[George Stephanopoulos]] asked Summers about the financial crisis in an ABC interview on March 15, 2009, Summers replied that "there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last eighteen months, but what's happened at A.I.G. ... the way it was not regulated, the way no one was watching ... is outrageous."

In February 2009, Summers quoted [[John Maynard Keynes]], saying "When circumstances change, I change my opinion", reflecting both on the failures of [[Wall Street]] deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Hirsh|title=The Reeducation of Larry Summers|url=http://www.newsweek.com/reeducation-larry-summers-82289|access-date=4 January 2014|newspaper=NewsWeek|date=February 20, 2009}}</ref> On April 18, 2010, in an interview on ABC's "This Week" program, Clinton said Summers was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives.

===President of Harvard===
In 2001, when [[George W. Bush]] became [[President of the United States|President]], Summers left the Treasury Department and returned to Harvard as its 27th president, serving from July 2001 until June 2006.<ref name=":0" /> He is considered Harvard's first Jewish president, though his predecessor Neil Rudenstine had Jewish ancestry, and received praise from Harvard's Jewish community for his support.<ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=511933 Harvard's First Jewish President]. The Harvard Crimson. March 8, 2006</ref>

A number of Summers's decisions at Harvard have attracted public controversy, either at the time or since his resignation.{{Such as?|date=May 2021}}

====Cornel West affair====
In an October 2001 meeting, Summers criticized African American Studies department head [[Cornel West]] for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the [[Bill Bradley]] presidential campaign, and complained that West was contributing to [[grade inflation]]. Summers also claimed that West's "rap" album was an "embarrassment" to the university. West pushed back strongly against the accusations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/06/some_seek_a_scholars_return/|title=Some seek a scholar's return|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=June 6, 2006|first1=Marcella|last1=Bombardieri}}</ref> "The hip-hop scared him. It's a stereotypical reaction", he said later. West, who later called Summers both "uninformed" and "an unprincipled power player" in describing this encounter in his book ''Democracy Matters'' (2004), subsequently returned to [[Princeton University]], where he had taught prior to [[Harvard University]].

====Differences between the sexes====
{{See also|Women in science}}
In January 2005, at a Conference on Diversifying the Science & Engineering Workforce sponsored by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], Summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented "in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions".

Summers had prefaced his talk, saying he was adopting an "entirely [[positivism|positive]], rather than [[normative]] approach" and that his remarks were intended to be an "attempt at provocation."<ref name="harvard2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |title=Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science & Engineering Workforce |access-date=2008-01-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |archive-date=January 30, 2008 }}. January 14, 2005.</ref>

Summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in high-end science and engineering positions:
# The high-powered job hypothesis
# Different availability of [[aptitude]] at the high end
# Different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search<ref name="harvard2005"/>

The second hypothesis, the generally [[Variability hypothesis|greater variability among men]] (compared to women) in tests of cognitive abilities,<ref>Hedges, L. V., & Nowell, A. (1995). Sex differences in mental scores, variability, and numbers of high scoring individuals. Science, 269, 41–45.</ref><ref>Lehrke, R. (1997). Sex linkage of intelligence: The X-Factor. NY: Praeger.</ref><ref>Lubinski, D., & Benbow, C. M. (2006). Study of mathematically precocious youth after 35 years. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 1, 316–345.</ref> leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions, caused the most controversy. In his discussion of this hypothesis, Summers said that "even small differences in the standard deviation [between genders] will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out [from the mean]".<ref name="harvard2005" /> Summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top 5% of twelfth-graders under various tests. He then went on to argue that, if this research were to be accepted, then "whatever the set of attributes ... that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at MIT or being a chemist at Berkeley ... are probably different in their standard deviations as well".<ref name="harvard2005"/>

Summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying:
<blockquote>So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong, because I would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and working very hard to address them.<ref name="harvard2005"/></blockquote>

Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.

This lunch-time talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship, and an intense negative response followed, both nationally and at Harvard.<ref name="Globe20050117">[https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire/ Summers' Remarks on Women Draw Fire].

[[The Independent]]. November 24, 2008</ref>

Summers's protégée [[Sheryl Sandberg]] has defended him, saying that "Larry has been a true advocate for women throughout his career" at the World Bank and Treasury. Referring to the lunch talk, Sandberg said, "What few seem to note is that it is remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place – that he cared enough about women's careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues and talk about what was going wrong".<ref>{{cite news|author=Sheryl Sandberg|title=Larry Summers' True Record on Women|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sheryl-sandberg/what-larry-summers-has-do_b_142126.html|access-date=4 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=November 7, 2008|author-link=Sheryl Sandberg}}</ref>

In 2016, remarking upon [[political correctness]] in institutions of higher education, Summers said:
<blockquote>There is a great deal of absurd political correctness. Now, I'm somebody who believes very strongly in diversity, who resists racism in all of its many incarnations, who thinks that there is a great deal that's unjust in American society that needs to be combated, but it seems to be that there is a kind of creeping totalitarianism in terms of what kind of ideas are acceptable and are debatable on college campuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/larry-summers-ii/?start=15&end=1606|title=Larry Summers II on Conversations with Bill Kristol|website=ConversationsWithBillKristol.org|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

====Summers' opposition and support at Harvard====
On March 15, 2005, members of the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]], which instructs graduate students in [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] and undergraduates in [[Harvard College]], passed 218–185 a motion of "lack of confidence" in the leadership of Summers, with 18 abstentions. A second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed 253 to 137, also with 18 abstentions.

The members of the [[Harvard Corporation]], the University's highest governing body, are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting Summers.

FAS faculty were not unanimous in their comments on Summers. Influential psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] defended the legitimacy of Summers's January lecture. When asked if Summers's talk was "within the pale of legitimate academic discourse," Pinker responded "Good grief, shouldn't everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse, as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor? That's the difference between a university and a [[madrassa]]. There is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously."<ref>[https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/1/19/psychoanalysis-q-and-a-steven-pinker-in-an/ Psychoanalysis Q-and-A: Steven Pinker]. [[The Harvard Crimson]]. January 19, 2005</ref>

Summers had stronger support among Harvard College students than among the college faculty. One poll by the Harvard Crimson indicated that students opposed his resignation by a three-to-one margin, with 57% of responding students opposing his resignation and 19% supporting it.<ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=511421 Poll: Students Say Summers Should Stay]. The Harvard Crimson. February 20, 2006</ref>

In July 2005, a board member of Harvard Corporation, [[Conrad K. Harper]], resigned saying he was angered both by the university president's comments about women and by Summers being given a salary increase. The resignation letter to the president said, "I could not and cannot support a raise in your salary, ... I believe that Harvard's best interests require your resignation."<ref>{{cite news|last=Finder|first=Alan|title=A Harvard Governor, Dissatisfied, Resigns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/education/29harvard.html?_r=0|access-date=December 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 29, 2005}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/education/02htext.html Board Member's Letter of Resignation]. The New York Times. August 2, 2005</ref>

====Support of economist Andrei Shleifer====
Harvard and [[Andrei Shleifer]], a close friend and protégé of Summers, controversially paid $28.5 million to settle a [[lawsuit]] by the U.S. government over the [[conflict of interest]] Shleifer had while advising [[Russia's privatisation program]]. The US government had sued Shleifer under the [[False Claims Act]], as he bought [[Russia]]n stocks while designing the country's [[privatisation]]. In 2004, a federal judge ruled that while Harvard had violated the contract, Shleifer and his associate alone were liable for [[treble damages]].

In June 2005, Harvard and Shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the US government. In August, Harvard, Shleifer, and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] reached an agreement under which the university paid $26.5 million to settle the five-year-old lawsuit. Shleifer was also responsible for paying $2 million worth of damages.

Because Harvard paid almost all of the damages and allowed Shleifer to retain his faculty position, the settlement provoked allegations of favoritism on Summers. His continued support for Shleifer strengthened Summers's unpopularity with other professors, as reported in the Harvard Crimson:

{{quote|I've been a member of this Faculty for over 45 years, and I am no longer easily shocked," is how Frederick H. Abernathy, the McKay professor of mechanical engineering, began his biting comments about the Shleifer case at Tuesday's fiery Faculty meeting. But, Abernathy continued, "I was deeply shocked and disappointed by the actions of this University" in the Shleifer affair.<ref name="crimson">{{cite news|title='Tawdry Shleifer Affair' Stokes Faculty Anger Toward Summers|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/2/10/tawdry-shleifer-affair-stokes-faculty-anger/|access-date=30 May 2013|newspaper=The Harvard Crimson|date=10 Feb 2006|author=Nicholas Ciarelli|author2=Anton Troianovski}}</ref>}}

In an 18,000-word article "How Harvard lost Russia" in ''[[Institutional Investor (magazine)|Institutional Investor]]'' by David McClintick (January 2006), the magazine detailed Shleifer's alleged efforts to use his [[Insider trading|inside knowledge]] of and sway over the Russian economy in order to make lucrative personal investments, all while leading a Harvard group, advising the Russian government, that was under contract with the U.S. The article suggests that Summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the University, although it noted that Summers had forewarned Shleifer and his wife Nancy Zimmerman about the conflict-of-interest regulations back in 1996.<ref name="crimson" />
Summers's friendship with Shleifer was well known by the Corporation when it selected him to succeed Rudenstine and Summers recused himself from all proceedings with Shleifer, whose case was actually handled by an independent committee led by former Harvard President [[Derek Bok]].

====Donations to Harvard from Jeffrey Epstein====

An article in the [[The Harvard Crimson|Harvard Crimson]] in 2003, during Summers' tenure as president, detailed a reportedly "special connection" between Summers and [[sex offender]] [[Jeffrey Epstein]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/5/1/mogul-donor-gives-harvard-more-than/?page=single|title=Mogul Donor Gives Harvard More Than Money {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref> Epstein pledged to donate at least $25 million to Harvard during Summers's tenure to endow Harvard's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein was given an office at Harvard for his personal use.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303|title=The Talented Mr. Epstein|last=Ward|first=Vicky|date=March 2003|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2019-07-12|quote=Epstein has pledged at least $25 million to Harvard to create the Epstein Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office at the university...He says he was reluctant to have his name attached to the program, but Summers persuaded him. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ped.fas.harvard.edu/home|title=Program for Evolutionary Dynamics|website=ped.fas.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref> Epstein otherwise had no formal connection to Harvard.<ref name=":1" /> Summers's ties to Epstein reportedly began "a number of years...before Summers became Harvard’s president and even before he was the Secretary of the Treasury."<ref name=":1" /> A charity funded by Epstein also donated to the production of a [[PBS]] show hosted by Summers's wife and Harvard professor [[Elisa New]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-has-a-secret-charity-heres-who-it-gave-money-to?ref=scroll|title=REVEALED: We Found Billionaire Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's Secret Charity|last=Briquelet|first=Kate|date=2019-07-10|work=Daily Beast|access-date=2019-07-12|quote=In 2016, Gratitude America Ltd. shelled out $110,000 to Verse Video Education.

====Winklevoss twins and Facebook====
In February 2004, the [[Winklevoss twins]] requested a meeting with Summers in order to ask him to intervene on their behalf in an ongoing dispute they had with [[Facebook]] founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The Winklevosses believed that Zuckerberg had stolen their idea for a social networking website and launched Facebook on his own, after they had asked him to be a part of their project, then called HarvardConnection. Summers believed that the matter was outside the university's jurisdiction, and advised the twins to take their complaint to the courts.<ref name="harvardgradsfaceoff">{{cite news |first=Shirin |last=Sharif |title=Harvard grads face off against thefacebook.com |date=2004-08-05 |publisher=The Stanford Daily |url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2004/08/05/harvard-grads-face-off-against-thefacebookcom/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618102603/http://www.stanforddaily.com/2004/08/05/harvard-grads-face-off-against-thefacebookcom/ |archive-date=2010-06-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Resignation as Harvard President====
On February 21, 2006, Summers announced his intention to step down at the end of the school year effective June 30, 2006. Harvard agreed to provide Summers on his resignation with a one-year paid [[sabbatical]] leave, subsidized a $1 million outstanding loan from the university for his personal residence, and provided other payments.<ref>President and Fellows of Harvard College, [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Form 990, 2006 & 2007.</ref> Former University President [[Derek Bok]] acted as Interim President while the University conducted a search for a replacement which ended with the naming of [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] on February 11, 2007.

===Business interests===
On October 19, 2006, Summers was hired as a part-time managing director of the New York-based hedge fund [[D. E.

===National Economic Council===
Upon the inauguration of [[Barack Obama]] as president in January 2009, Summers was appointed to the post of director of the [[National Economic Council (United States)|National Economic Council]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/21/AR2010092104828.html|title=Lawrence Summers to leave economic council, return to Harvard|last=Montgomery|first=Lori|date=2010-09-22|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> In this position Summers emerged as a key economic decision-maker in the Obama administration, where he attracted both praise and criticism. There had been friction between Summers and former Federal Reserve Chairman [[Paul Volcker]], as Volcker accused Summers of delaying the effort to organize a panel of outside economic advisers, and Summers had cut Volcker out of White House meetings and had not shown interest in collaborating on policy solutions to the economic crisis.<ref>{{cite news | last=Schmidt | first=Robert |author2=Julianna Goldman|title=Volcker Chafes at Obama Panel Delay, Strains With Summers Rise|work=Bloomberg|date=February 5, 2009|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aaLzJZKNcc6Y}}</ref> On the other hand, Obama himself was reportedly thrilled with the work Summers did in his first few weeks on the job.

In January 2009, as the [[Obama Administration]] tried to pass an economic stimulus spending bill, Representative [[Peter DeFazio]] ([[U.S. Democratic Party|D]]-[[Oregon|OR.]]) criticized Summers, saying that he thought that President [[Barack Obama]] is "ill-advised by Larry Summers.

According to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Summers called Senator [[Chris Dodd]] (D-[[Connecticut|CT]]) asking him to remove caps on executive pay at firms that have received stimulus money, including Citigroup.<ref>{{cite news |last=Soloman|first=Deborah|author2=Mark Maremont|title=Bankers Face Strict Pay Cap|pages=1, above the fold|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=February 14–15, 2009}}</ref>

On April 3, 2009 Summers came under renewed criticism after it was disclosed that he was paid millions of dollars the previous year by companies which he now had influence over as a [[public servant]]. He earned $5 million from the [[hedge fund]] D. E. Shaw, and collected $2.7 million in speaking fees from [[Wall Street]] companies that received government [[bailout]] money.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff|last=Zeleny|title=Financial Industry Paid Millions to Obama Aide|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/us/politics/04disclose.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 3, 2009|access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref>

In April 2016, he was one of eight former Treasury secretaries who called on the [[United Kingdom]] to remain a member of the [[European Union]] ahead of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|June 2016 Referendum]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Staying in EU 'best hope' for UK's future say ex-US Treasury secretaries|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36087583|work=BBC News|date=April 20, 2016}}</ref>

Summers referred to the United Kingdom's "Brexit" vote on June 23, 2016—which concluded in favor of leaving the European Union—as the "worst self-inflicted policy wound that a country has done since the Second World War". However, Summers cautioned that the result was a "wake up call for elites everywhere" and called for "responsible nationalism" in response to simmering public sentiment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/2016/06/24/world/lawrence-summers-brexit-wakeup-call-elites|title=Lawrence Summers on Brexit: A wakeup call for elites|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref>

In June 2016, Summers also wrote, "I believe the risks to the US and global economies of Mr Trump’s election as president are far greater [than passage of Brexit]. If he is elected, I would expect a protracted recession to begin within 18 months. The damage would be felt far beyond the United States."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://larrysummers.com/2016/06/06/the-economic-consequences-of-a-trump-win-would-be-severe/|title=The economic consequences of a Trump win would be severe &#124; Larry Summers}}</ref>

==Candidacy for chairmanship of the Federal Reserve==
In 2013, Summers emerged as one of two leading candidates, along with [[Janet Yellen]], to succeed [[Ben Bernanke]] as head of the [[Federal Reserve System]] in 2014. The possibility of his nomination created a great deal of controversy with some Senators of both parties declaring opposition. On September 15, Summers withdrew his name from consideration for the position, writing: "I have reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interest of the Federal Reserve, the Administration or, ultimately, the interests of the nation's ongoing economic recovery."<ref>{{cite web

==Criticism of the Biden Administration==

Summers emerged as an early opponent of the macroeconomic policy employed by President [[Joe Biden]], charging the $1.9 trillion [[American Rescue Plan Act of 2021]] as "the least responsible macroeconomic policy we’ve had in the last 40 years."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Williams|first=Jordan|date=2021-03-20|title=Larry Summers blasts $1.9 T stimulus as 'least responsible' economic policy in 40 years|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/544188-larry-summers-blasts-least-responsible-economic-policy-in-40-years|access-date=2021-04-25|website=TheHill|language=en}}</ref> The macroeconomic framework, Summers holds, risks an economic recession and market destabilization.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Williams|first=Jordan|date=2021-03-20|title=Larry Summers blasts $1.9 T stimulus as 'least responsible' economic policy in 40 years|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/544188-larry-summers-blasts-least-responsible-economic-policy-in-40-years|access-date=2021-04-25|website=TheHill|language=en}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
The 2010 film ''[[The Social Network]]'', which deals with the founding of the social networking site [[Facebook]], shows Summers (played by [[Douglas Urbanski]]), in his then-capacity as President of Harvard, meeting with [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] to discuss their accusations against [[Mark Zuckerberg]].

In the 2010 documentary ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'', Summers is presented as one of the key figures behind the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. Charles Ferguson points out the economist's role in what he characterizes as the deregulation of many domains of the financial sector.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Charles|title=Larry Summers and the Subversion of Economics|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Larry-Summersthe/124790/|access-date=January 4, 2014|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=October 3, 2010}}</ref>

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "E My Sports" (S30 E17), the character Principal Seymour Skinner looks at a $100 bill and remarks "$100 bill, autographed by Lawrence Summers. Such a carefree signature, before the great recession."
