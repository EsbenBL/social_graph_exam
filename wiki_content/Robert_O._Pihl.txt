===Research and publications===

Pihl’s research includes over 250 publications, on which he has collaborated with over 200 co-authors from around the world. According to Google Scholar, his work has been cited over 16,000 times.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=Robert+O.+Pihl&hl=en&as_sdt=0,10 |title=Robert O. Pihl on Google Scholar |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 March 2021 |website=Google Scholar |access-date=9 March 2021}}</ref>  He is also on the board of reviewing editors for ''[[Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15300277/homepage/editorialboard.html |title=Editorial Board - Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 March 2021 |website=Wiley Online Library |access-date=9 March 2021}}</ref>  Pihl’s research addresses [[psychopharmacology]], [[alcohol use disorder]], aggression, [[substance use disorder]], [[behavior modification]], the cognitive consequences of [[addiction]], and several risk factors for disorders.

Some of Pihl's early research projects involved the hair analysis of children with learning disabilities. He found that children with learning disabilities had higher levels of [[lead]] and [[cadmium]] in their hair compared to children without these disabilities.<ref name="Hair Analysis">Pihl, R.O. The lead level is connected to the cadmium level, the cadmium level is connected to the lithium level, and that may be why they have trouble learning. Paper presented at the 1979 OACLD and OISE Conference on Learning Disabilities, Toronto, February 1979.</ref> These findings influenced the U.S. Congress to mandate that lead be removed from paint in the 1970s. Pihl later conducted similar analyses in which he also found greater levels of lead and cadmium in the hair of violent criminals, compared to the normal population.<ref name="Hair Analysis Violent Criminals">Pihl, R.O., Ervin, F.R., Pelletier, G., Deikel, S.& Strain, W. 1982. Hair element content of violent criminals. ''Canadian Journal of Psychiatry'', 27, 533-534.</ref>

Pihl has extensively studied the link between alcohol and aggression, namely that alcohol consumption increases aggression. He has also studied other predictors of aggression, such as pain sensitivity, levels of cognitive functioning, and one’s social environment.<ref name="Alcohol and Aggression">Pihl, R.O., Lau, M., and Assaad, J.M. (1997). Aggressive Disposition, Alcohol, and Aggression. [[Aggressive Behavior]], 23: 11-18. DOI: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1997)23:1<11::AID-AB2>3.0.CO;2-W</ref> His investigations of the link between [[Acute tryptophan depletion|tryptophan depletion]] and aggression suggest an association between disturbances of the brain’s serotonin system and one’s aggression.<ref name="Tryptophan Depletion">LeMarquand, D. G., Pihl, R. O., Young, S. N., Tremblay, R. E., Seguin, J. R., Palmour, R. M., & Benkelfat, C. (January 1, 1998). Tryptophan Depletion, Executive Functions, and Disinhibition in Aggressive, Adolescent Males.</ref> Pihl linked this research to alcohol intoxication, finding that intoxicated subjects with lower tryptophan (and thus lower serotonin) levels in the brain were more aggressive than those with higher serotonin levels.<ref name="Tryptophan, Alcohol, and Aggression">Pihl, R. O., Young, S. N., Harden, P., Plotnick, S., Chamberlain, B., & Ervin, F. R. (June 01, 1995). Acute effect of altered tryptophan levels and alcohol on aggression in normal human males. ''Psychopharmacology'', 119, 4, 353-360</ref>
Pihl has also researched motivational, physiological, and cognitive factors that predict non-medical substance use. Pihl looked at people’s varying reactions to substance consumption, and how this affects their behavior when intoxicated. He investigated the risk factors for abuse of different substances, and in 2000 Pihl collaborated in developing The Substance Use Risk Profile Scale, a scale for classifying people who use substances based on personality and motivational risk factors for substance use, such as hopelessness, impulsivity, and sensation-seeking.<ref name="Substance Use Risk Profile Scale">Woicik, P.A., Pihl, R.O., Stewart, S.H., Conrod, P.J. (2009). ''Psychology of Addictive Behaviors'', 34: 1042-1055.</ref>
