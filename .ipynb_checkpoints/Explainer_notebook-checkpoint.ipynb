    "By looking into the researchers from each discipline we hope to find patterns in the connections both within the five categories but also between the five social sciences. We will first seek to answer the question of, what characteristics does the community of the five social sciences have? We will examine this question by looking into the over network properties of each followed by a network analysis. Thereafter we will examine the communities of the social sciences, by doing this we will answer these questions: Are the traditional categories within the social science community actually also apt/suitable for the social science community? Or are the categorizations just a historic relic which we should reject, and then embrace some other maybe more relevant categorizations within the social sciences? By looking into this it becomes possible to either deny or affirm the different scientists relevance within the different disciplines of the social science community. \n",

We hope that our community detection models and our HSMB models maybe can give interested people a nuance in their view of the social sciences, instead of keeping to the old disciplines.

For each of these five categories we have a list of scientists on wikipedia. We used these five lists of scientists to find and categorise all the scientists in our final dataset. After gathering all the names from the five lists, we then gather each individual scientists wikipage. Thus our data gathering process has two parts: 1) get social scientists from each of the five lists, 2) gather each scientists wikipage. \n",
